      <text>Neutrophils generated by granulocyte colony&#8208;stimulating factor (GCSF) are functionally immature and, consequently, cannot effectively reduce infection and infection&#8208;related mortality in cancer chemotherapy&#8208;induced neutropenia (CCIN). Am80, a retinoic acid (RA) agonist that enhances granulocytic differentiation by selectively activating transcription factor RA receptor alpha (RAR&#945;), alternatively promotes RA&#8208;target gene expression. We found that in normal and malignant primary human hematopoietic specimens, Am80&#8208;GCSF combination coordinated proliferation with differentiation to develop complement receptor&#8208;3 (CR3)&#8208;dependent neutrophil innate immunity, through altering transcription of RA&#8208;target genes RAR&#946;2, C/EBP&#949;, CD66,CD11b, and CD18. This led to generation of functional neutrophils capable of fighting infection, whereas neutralizing neutrophil innate immunity with anti&#8208;CD18 antibody abolished neutrophil bactericidal activities induced by Am80&#8208;GCSF. Further, Am80&#8208;GCSF synergy was evaluated using six different dose&#8208;schedule&#8208;infection mouse CCIN models. The data demonstrated that during &#8220;emergency&#8221; granulopoiesis in CCIN mice undergoing transient systemic intravenous bacterial infection, Am80 effect on differentiating granulocytic precursors synergized with GCSF&#8208;dependent myeloid expansion, resulting in large amounts of functional neutrophils that reduced infection. Importantly, extensive survival tests covering a full cycle of mouse CCIN with perpetual systemic intravenous bacterial infection proved that without causing myeloid overexpansion, Am80&#8208;GCSF generated sufficient numbers of functional neutrophils that significantly reduced infection&#8208;related mortality in CCIN mice. These findings reveal a differential mechanism for generating functional neutrophils to reduce CCIN&#8208;associated infection and mortality, providing a rationale for future therapeutic approaches.</text>

      <text>CCIN is a condition in which the number of neutrophils in patients' bloodstream is decreased, leading to increased susceptibility to microbial infections. Thus, rapidly generating large amounts of functional neutrophils through &#8220;emergency&#8221; granulopoiesis (Panopoulos &amp; Watowich, 2008) is needed to defend against infection in CCIN. GCSF, a lineage&#8208;specific hematopoietic growth factor for promoting neutrophil production from hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) (Panopoulos &amp; Watowich, 2008), has been a main drug used for CCIN treatment for over 2 decades. The increased expansion of granulocytic precursors in response to GCSF results in an elevated proportion of early neutrophil forms in&#160;vivo, for example, myeloblast or promyelocyte (Lord et&#160;al, 1989, 1991), whereas neutrophils induced by GCSF are inadequately differentiated with impaired microbicidal functions (Leavey et&#160;al, 1998; Donini et&#160;al, 2007; Dick et&#160;al, 2008; Ding et&#160;al, 2013). Therefore, although GCSF profoundly increases the number of immature neutrophils to reduce the duration of neutropenia, CCIN remains challenging with substantial morbidity and mortality (Hartmann et&#160;al, 1997; Heath et&#160;al, 2003; Sung et&#160;al, 2007; Bohlius et&#160;al, 2008; Gurion et&#160;al, 2012; Mhaskar et&#160;al, 2014), as well as healthcare cost (Liou et&#160;al, 2007; Michels et&#160;al, 2012). Moreover, there is a potential association between clinical use of GCSF and development of myeloid malignancy (Smith et&#160;al, 2003; Rosenberg et&#160;al, 2006; Hershman et&#160;al, 2007; Socie et&#160;al, 2007; Beekman &amp; Touw, 2010). As such, an alternative mode of treatment is needed for CCIN, which can induce sufficient numbers of functional neutrophils while preventing the risk of myeloid malignancy.</text>

      <text>RA has potent pan action for binding to and transactivating two classes of nuclear receptor transcription factors, retinoic acid receptors (RAR&#945;, &#946;, &#947;) and retinoid X receptors (RXR&#945;, &#946;, &#947;) (Chambon, 1996; Umemiya et&#160;al, 1997; Kagechika, 2002). RA induces granulocytic differentiation by mediating gene transcription in various normal and tumor tissues (Collins, 2008; Gudas, 2012), for example, transactivating RAR&#947; to enhance HSC self&#8208;renewal while promoting differentiation of committed myeloid progenitors by activating RAR&#945; (Purton et&#160;al, 2006). Am80 (tamibarotene) (Kagechika, 2002) is designed to avoid the side effects of RA pan action in clinical use, for example, skin irritation resulting from RA binding of RAR&#947; (Standeven et&#160;al, 1997). Although Am80 is selective for RAR&#945; and RAR&#946;, which function as the master regulators of granulocytic differentiation and tumor suppression, respectively (Alvarez et&#160;al, 2007; Collins, 2008), it preferentially activates RAR&#945; (Umemiya et&#160;al, 1997; Kagechika, 2002; Jimi et&#160;al, 2007). Since 2005, Am80 has been approved for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in Japan (Miwako &amp; Kagechika, 2007). Recent studies show that Am80 can induce modest production of neutrophils displaying significantly higher bactericidal activity in&#160;vitro, compared to those induced by GCSF (Ding et&#160;al, 2013). This raises question: Could Am80&#8208;GCSF combination serve as a novel synergist, acting through differential mechanisms by synchronizing Am80's competence for promoting neutrophil differentiation with GCSF's profound capability for myeloid expansion, to induce sufficient numbers of functional neutrophils fighting infection?</text>

      <text>Using different human granulopoietic systems and mouse CCIN models, our study reveals a novel Am80&#8208;GCSF synergy that can induce large amounts of functional neutrophils to reduce CCIN&#8208;associated infection and mortality while preventing myeloid overexpansion. This is likely through altering transcription of RA&#8208;target genes that promote differentiation of GCSF&#8208;expanded granulocytic precursors into functional neutrophils with well&#8208;developed CR3 immunity.</text>

      <text>We first asked whether Am80&#8208;GCSF combination could induce more functional neutrophils than did Am80 alone. Normal primary human hematopoietic CD34+ precursors were treated with human&#160;plasma concentration doses of Am80 and/or GCSF (Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S1) for up to 6&#160;days. Then, neutrophils generated from CD34+ cells were evaluated with bacterial killing as well as production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), an essential neutrophil function against infection (Nauseef, 2007; Uriarte et&#160;al, 2011). The results (Fig&#160;1A) showed that compared to Am80, Am80&#8208;GCSF induced significantly larger amounts of neutrophils with better morphologic differentiation, increased bacterial killing, as well as enhanced ROS production stimulated with neutrophil activator fMLP or PMA (Barnes et&#160;al, 2012). Since Am80 selectively activates RAR&#945; (Umemiya et&#160;al, 1997; Kagechika, 2002; Jimi et&#160;al, 2007) to alter transcription of cell cycle inhibitor p21 Cip/Kip versus several other granulocytic differentiation regulators in CD34+ precursors and NB4 cells (Appendix&#160;Fig S1), we investigated how Am80&#8208;GCSF modulated expression of 12 different RA&#8208;target genes (Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S2) that play key roles in control of granulocytic differentiation. CD34+ cells were treated with Am80&#8208;GCSF for different time periods and then followed by qRT&#8211;PCR analyses. We found that 6 of 12 genes analyzed were dynamically modulated by Am80&#8208;GCSF at different differentiation induction stages (Fig&#160;1B, day 1 versus day 2 versus day 6), including the tumor suppressor RAR&#946;2 (Soprano et&#160;al, 2004; Alvarez et&#160;al, 2007), terminal granulocytic differentiation regulator C/EBP&#949; (Park et&#160;al, 1999; Lekstrom&#8208;Himes, 2001), as well as neutrophil innate immunity regulators CD66c, CD66b, CD11b (Skubitz et&#160;al, 1996; Park et&#160;al, 1999; Ding et&#160;al, 2013), and CD18 (Bush et&#160;al, 2003; Ding et&#160;al, 2013). Notably, whereas both RAR&#946;2 and C/EBP&#949; were consistently induced, they were associated with differential transcriptional induction of innate immunity regulators, that is, CD66c in all stages, CD66b in the early stage, CD11b in the middle stage, and CD18 in the late stage, suggesting that Am80&#8208;GCSF mediated a course of neutrophil differentiation&#8208;associated innate immunity development. Markedly, Am80&#8208;GCSF promoted significantly higher expression of these genes than did Am80 in the early and late differentiation induction stages (Fig&#160;1B, day 1 and day 6), whereas Am80 induced higher expressions in the middle stage (Fig&#160;1B, day 2). Interestingly, although both GCSF and Am80&#8208;GCSF are highly statistically significant in promoting transcription of RAR&#946;2, C/EBP&#949;, CD66c, and CD18 than did Am80 in the late differentiation induction stage, such effects on changes in transcriptional induction folds were relatively small (Fig&#160;1B, day 6). It is known that co&#8208;expression of different CD66 subunits with CD18 surface marker are crucial in mediating CR3&#8208;dependent neutrophil innate immunity against infection (Skubitz et&#160;al, 1996; Ding et&#160;al, 2013). Thus, we assessed co&#8208;expression of CD66&#8208;CD18 surface markers induced by Am80&#8208;GCSF in the late differentiation induction stage, using flow cytometry analyses. The results showed that Am80&#8208;GCSF induced significantly higher co&#8208;expression of CD66&#8208;CD18 surface markers than did Am80 or GCSF alone at day 6 (Fig&#160;1C). Moreover, because CD18 and CD11b are CR3 components mediating neutrophil function against microbial infection (Groves et&#160;al, 2008), we tested whether CR3&#8208;dependent bactericidal activities induced by Am80&#8208;GCSF in CD34+ cells were also promoted in primary human peripheral blood (PB) specimens collected from normal human donors. The results showed that compared to GCSF, neutrophils induced by Am80&#8208;GCSF from normal primary human PB mononuclear cells showed significantly higher bacterial killing and ROS production, mimicking the bactericidal activities observed in normal primary human PB neutrophils (Fig&#160;1Di versus ii, iii). Further, anti&#8208;CD18 and/or &#8208;CD11b antibodies markedly abolished ROS production in normal primary human PB neutrophils (Fig&#160;1E). Accordingly, neutrophils differentiated from normal primary human PB mononuclear cells by Am80&#8208;GCSF killed markedly more bacteria, whereas such increased bacterial killing was significantly blocked with anti&#8208;CD18 antibody neutralization (Fig&#160;1Fi versus ii). These data show that&#160;Am80&#8208;GCSF can generate significantly larger amounts of functional neutrophils than does Am80, whereas significantly higher expression of CD66, CD18, and CD11b induced by Am80&#8208;GCSF in these neutrophils promotes the development of neutrophil innate immunity.</text>

      <text>Systematic review and meta&#8208;analysis of 5,256 patients show that providing GCSF to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients post&#8208;chemotherapy does not affect overall survival or infectious rate (Gurion et&#160;al, 2012), whereas GCSF may induce myeloid malignancy in neutropenic patients (Smith et&#160;al, 2003; Rosenberg et&#160;al, 2006; Hershman et&#160;al, 2007; Socie et&#160;al, 2007; Beekman &amp; Touw, 2010). Thus, we investigated whether Am80&#8208;GCSF combination could generate functional neutrophils against infection while suppressing malignant growth in non&#8208;APL AML specimens. We first combined low human plasma concentration dose of Am80 (20&#160;nM) with medium human plasma concentration dose of GCSF (25&#160;ng/ml) for the test, as described in Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S1. The results showed that in treatment of bone marrow (BM) specimen collected from AML patient for 4&#160;days, Am80&#8208;GCSF induced significantly higher ROS production than did GCSF or Am80 while sustaining proliferation similar to GCSF (Fig&#160;2Ai and ii). Further to assess dynamic changes in expression of RA&#8208;target genes in cultured AML specimen, we found that similar to those in normal cells (see Fig&#160;1B), Am80&#8208;GCSF induced significantly higher transcription of RA&#8208;target genes compared to Am80 in both early and late differentiation induction stages (Fig&#160;2Bi, day 2, day 6). However, in contrast to normal cells (see Fig&#160;1B), Am80&#8208;GCSF induced significantly higher expression of RA&#8208;target genes than did GCSF in AML cells throughout the full differentiation induction period (Fig&#160;2Bi, days 2, 3, 6), including tumor suppressor RAR&#946;2 (Soprano et&#160;al, 2004; Alvarez et&#160;al, 2007),&#160;terminal granulocytic differentiation regulator C/EBP&#949; (Park et&#160;al,&#160;1999; Lekstrom&#8208;Himes, 2001), and CR3 component CD11b (Park&#160;et&#160;al, 1999). Although this altered transcription pattern by Am80&#8208;GCSF was associated with significantly higher ROS production than Am80 or GCSF, Am80&#8208;GCSF sustained proliferation similar to GCSF in AML specimens with 3&#160;days of treatment (Fig&#160;2Bii versus iii).</text>

      <text>Next, using a longer period of treatment, we titrated dose ranges of Am80 when combined with GCSF in generating functional neutrophils while inhibiting leukemic growth in primary AML specimens. The clinical doses of GCSF for CCIN treatment have been established worldwide over the past 2 decades, whereas the medium human plasma concentration dose of GCSF (25&#160;ng/ml) in mediating granulocytic differentiation of different human hematopoietic precursors (Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S1B) has been well established in&#160;vitro (Hao et&#160;al, 1998; Luo et&#160;al, 2007; Lou et&#160;al, 2013). Therefore, we evaluated different Am80 doses that ranged from low to high human plasma concentrations converted from clinical use, including 20, 50, 100, and 150&#160;nM Am80, in combination with 25&#160;ng/ml GCSF, respectively (Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S1). First, BM specimens collected from AML patients were treated with 20 or 50&#160;nM Am80 alone or in combination with GCSF for 9&#160;days. The results showed that compared to GCSF, these Am80&#8208;GCSF combinations significantly inhibited proliferation after 9&#160;days of treatment (Fig&#160;3Ai and ii). We then performed 12&#160;days of treatment using 20, 100, or 150&#160;nM Am80 in combination with GCSF. We found that similar to the observation derived from 9&#8208;day treatment (see Fig&#160;3A), the combination of 100 or 150&#160;nM Am80 with GCSF significantly inhibited proliferation compared to GCSF alone in all specimens tested (Fig&#160;3Bi&#8211;iv). However, the combination of 20&#160;nM Am80 with GCSF did not inhibit leukemic growth in one specimen (Fig&#160;3Biv). Moreover, neutrophils induced by 150&#160;nM Am80 combined with GCSF killed significantly more bacteria than those induced by GCSF or Am80 alone (Fig&#160;3Ci and ii). Further, we systemically evaluated the effect of 150&#160;nM Am80, the plasma concentration dose nearly reaching the routine clinical usage of Am80 for APL (Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S1A), on inducing functional neutrophils when combined with GCSF. The results showed that in parallel to inhibiting leukemic growth after 12&#160;days of treatment (Fig&#160;3Di), Am80&#8208;GCSF promoted the highest neutrophil ROS production, bacterial killing, and morphologic differentiation (Fig&#160;3Dii&#8211;iv). Notably, compared to GCSF or Am80 alone, Am80&#8208;GCSF markedly induced both RAR&#946;2 and C/EBP&#949; in association with CD66c (Fig&#160;3Dv). Similarly, in the NB4 leukemia cell line, Am80&#8208;GCSF also induced growth inhibition, ROS production, and altered RA&#8208;target gene expression (Appendix&#160;Fig S2). Collectively, these data show that by sustaining a consistently significant induction of both tumor suppressor RAR&#946;2 and terminal granulocytic differentiation regulator C/EBP&#949; in primary AML specimens, Am80&#8208;GCSF effectively inhibits malignant growth while producing well&#8208;differentiated functional neutrophils. Moreover, the defined dose range of Am80 when combined with GCSF suggests a &#8220;therapeutic window&#8221; that can serve as a reference for the future clinical study of Am80&#8208;GCSF treatment of CCIN.</text>

      <text>To evaluate Am80&#8208;GCSF synergy in&#160;vivo, we first asked whether Am80 could effectively differentiate granulocytic precursors into functional neutrophils in CCIN mice. Our established mouse CCIN model (Fig&#160;4A), which resembles human CCIN (Appendix&#160;Fig S3) described by other groups (Crawford et&#160;al, 1991; Trillet&#8208;Lenoir et&#160;al, 1993), was applied in the tests. These mouse and human models show that CCIN consists of both neutrophil decrease (granulopoiesis is inhibited) and neutrophil recovery (&#8220;emergency&#8221; granulopoiesis) stages, where the risk for microbial infection significantly increases. Because granulopoiesis is suppressed in the neutrophil decrease stage, this provides a unique in&#160;vivo setting to test whether Am80 could differentiate existing granulocytic precursors into functional neutrophils. We used human equivalent doses (HED) of Am80 and/or GCSF (Fig&#160;4B) in these tests. Since neutrophils induced by high HED of GCSF in CCIN mice failed to fight bacterial infection compared to neutrophils induced by high HED of Am80 (Ding et&#160;al, 2013), we evaluated low and medium HED of Am80 and/or GCSF. Normal C57BL6/J mice were injected with cancer chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide (CPA) to induce CCIN, versus control mice without CPA (Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S3). After 4&#160;h of CPA injection, mice were treated with low or medium doses of Am80 and/or GCSF for 3&#160;days (Fig&#160;4C versus G). On day 2 of neutrophil decrease, Gram&#8208;positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (S.&#160;aureus) causing bacteremia in neutropenic patients with cancer (Gonzalez&#8208;Barca et&#160;al, 2001) were used to transiently infect mice for up to 16&#160;h. As expected, infection&#8208;promoted induction of PB neutrophils only occurred in control mice (Fig&#160;4D and H). Ficoll isolation separated control mice's PB neutrophils from PB mononuclear cells, whereas Percoll gradient segregation of control mice's BM identified that the less and more mature BM neutrophils were concentrated in the second and third layers, respectively (Appendix&#160;Fig S4). We found that neutrophil generation was significantly suppressed in both BM and PB of all CCIN mice compared to control mice (Fig&#160;4D, E, H and I). However, among CCIN mice groups, both low and medium doses of Am80 sustained significantly higher numbers of neutrophils than did GCSF in PB, while having the least in BM compared to GCSF or Am80&#8208;GCSF (Fig&#160;4E and I, i versus ii). Interestingly, neutrophil levels maintained by Am80&#8208;GCSF were closer to Am80 in PB but more comparable to GCSF in BM (Fig&#160;4E and I). In parallel, PB collected from living mice 3&#160;h post&#8208;infection or euthanized mice 16&#160;h post&#8208;infection&#160;was evaluated for neutrophil bacterial killing. We found that PB neutrophils induced by either low or medium dose of Am80 killed significantly more bacteria than those induced by GCSF or Am80&#8208;GCSF (Fig&#160;4F and J). Altogether, because Am80 induces higher numbers of neutrophils in PB while causing the least to remain in BM, this suggests that when granulopoiesis is inhibited in CCIN mice, Am80&#8208;enhanced bacterial killing is the result of Am80&#8208;induced effective differentiation of existing granulocytic precursors into functional neutrophils.</text>

      <text>BM &#8220;emergency&#8221; granulopoiesis for rapidly producing large numbers of neutrophils occurs during the neutrophil recovery stage of mouse or human CCIN (see Fig&#160;4A; Appendix&#160;Fig S3). We addressed whether, during this stage, the potent effect of Am80 on neutrophil differentiation (see Fig&#160;4) could synergize with GCSF&#8208;mediated myeloid expansion to generate sufficient numbers of functional neutrophils fighting infection. Because either low or medium dose of Am80 effectively differentiated granulocytic precursors into functional neutrophils (see Fig&#160;4), we used the low&#8208;dose Am80&#8208;GCSF in this test. As illustrated (Fig&#160;5A), 2&#160;days after CPA injection, mice were treated with low&#8208;dose regimens for 3&#160;days. Then, mice were transiently infected with S.&#160;aureus via tail vein for up to 16&#160;h. As expected, significant increases in PB neutrophils were observed in all groups after bacterial infection (Fig&#160;5B). PB collected at 3 and 16&#160;h post&#8208;infection was used to assess neutrophil bactericidal activity. All three independent experiments showed that neutrophils generated by Am80&#8208;GCSF, but not by Am80 or GCSF alone, killed significantly more bacteria (Fig&#160;5C). By evaluating neutrophil generation in these CCIN mice, we found that in either the BM's second layer (containing less mature neutrophils) or third layer (containing more mature neutrophils) or the PB's mononuclear or neutrophil layer, Am80 induced fewer neutrophils compared to GCSF or Am80&#8208;GCSF (Fig&#160;5D and E; left sections). Both GCSF and Am80&#8208;GCSF induced significantly greater numbers of morphologically differentiated neutrophils in PB (Fig&#160;5E). However, in both PB mononuclear and neutrophil layers, the degree of neutrophil nuclear segmentation induced by Am80&#8208;GCSF was similar to those in control mice but significantly higher than those in GCSF or Am80 mice (Fig&#160;5E, right sections, images 5 versus 1 or 3 or 4). These results indicate that in the neutrophil recovery stage of mouse CCIN, Am80 has the least capacity to promote BM granulopoiesis, whereas GCSF induces large amounts of immature neutrophils as shown by both bacterial killing and neutrophil nuclear segmentation (Fig&#160;5C&#8211;E). However, Am80&#8208;GCSF can synergize Am80's ability of granulocytic differentiation with GCSF's competence of myeloid expansion, thus generating large amounts of functional neutrophils that reduce infection in CCIN mice.</text>

      <text>Since transient bacterial infection was effectively reduced in CCIN mice treated with Am80&#8208;GCSF (see Fig&#160;5), we further addressed whether this Am80&#8208;GCSF synergy could reduce infection&#8208;related mortality of CCIN mice undergoing perpetual systemic intravenous bacterial infection, using three different dose&#8208;schedule&#8208;survival models covering a full cycle of mouse CCIN. As illustrated in survival model #1 (Fig&#160;6A), mice were given low doses of Am80 and/or GCSF after 4&#160;h of CPA injection, and S.&#160;aureus infection was initiated on day 3. Two survival measurements, including general survival on day 9 following CPA injection and infectious survival after 6&#160;days of S.&#160;aureus infection (Fig&#160;6Bi and ii), demonstrated that Am80&#8208;GCSF significantly reduced infection&#8208;related mortality in CCIN mice. Three independent experiments showed similar results (Appendix&#160;Fig S5A). To examine bactericidal functions of newly generated neutrophils, mice surviving on day 9 from control and Am80&#8208;GCSF groups of survival model #1 were again injected with S.&#160;aureus or vehicle solution for 15&#160;min before euthanasia. Parallel Giemsa and Gram stains showed that PB neutrophils from infected mice were able to phagocytose bacteria, whereas PB neutrophils from mice injected with vehicle solution were free of bacteria (Fig&#160;6C). Since GCSF is usually given to patients &#8805;&#160;24&#160;h post&#8208;administration of chemotherapy drug, we tested both low and medium doses of Am80&#8208;GCSF treatment 24&#160;h post&#8208;CPA, as illustrated (Fig&#160;6D&#160;and F). Two independent tests were performed for each dose in these survival models, respectively (Appendix&#160;Fig S5B and C). We found that with low&#8208;dose treatment, Am80&#8208;GCSF mice experienced 100% survival compared to only 12.5% survival in GCSF mice (Fig&#160;6E). In contrast, medium&#8208;dose treatment showed no statistical difference in survival rate between Am80&#8208;GCSF (55.6%) and GCSF (11.1%) groups (Fig&#160;6G). Altogether, these data demonstrate that low&#8208;dose Am80&#8208;GCSF can effectively reduce infection&#8208;related mortality of CCIN mice experiencing perpetual bacterial infection.</text>

      <text>Further, we investigated in&#160;vivo myeloid expansion and granulocytic differentiation mediated by Am80&#8208;GCSF. By examining myeloid production versus neutrophil differentiation in CCIN mice surviving on day 9, we found that GCSF&#8208;induced BM myeloid cells concentrated in the second layer, known to contain less mature neutrophils (Fig&#160;7A, upper section). In contrast, more mature BM neutrophils known to localize in the third layer were significantly induced by Am80&#8208;GCSF (Fig&#160;7A, lower section). GCSF mice produced the largest amount of morphologically differentiated PB neutrophils compared to control or Am80&#8208;GCSF mice (Fig&#160;7B). However, these neutrophils displayed less intense nuclear segmentation (Fig&#160;7B, right section, neutrophil layer) and, importantly, failed to reduce infection and infection&#8208;related mortality in CCIN mice (see Figs&#160;5 and 6). Remarkably, the increased production of PB neutrophils in Am80&#8208;GCSF mice during &#8220;emergency&#8221; granulopoiesis (Fig&#160;7B) not only returned to the similar levels shown in control mice on day 13, but also displayed nuclear segmentation similar to those in control mice (Fig&#160;7Ci and ii). Moreover, the increased spleen size and weight in Am80&#8208;GCSF mice on day 9 dropped to the levels similar to those in control mice on day 13 (Fig&#160;7Ciii and iv). Compared to GCSF mice, neutrophil production in Am80&#8208;GCSF mice was not associated with significant loss of body weight (Fig&#160;7D). Further ultrastructural analysis of newly generated PB neutrophils collected from mice surviving on day 11 showed that in clear contrast to neutrophils from control or Am80&#8208;GCSF mice, neutrophils from GCSF mice displayed cellular degeneration. This was evidenced by significantly increased numbers of variably sized intracytoplasmic vacuoles, displaying empty or homogeneous matrix and irregular amorphous material or myelin structure (Fig&#160;7Ei and ii). Neutrophils from GCSF mice also displayed markedly higher levels of inner nuclear membrane dilation or separation from outer nuclear membrane, an indication of disrupted nuclear envelope (Fig&#160;7Ei, images 1 versus 2 or 3; 7Eiii). Furthermore, less numbers of granules appeared in neutrophils from GCSF mice than in the neutrophils of control or Am80&#8208;GCSF mice (Fig&#160;7Ei). Altogether, these results demonstrate that during &#8220;emergency&#8221; granulopoiesis of mouse CCIN, GCSF produces the largest amount of immature neutrophils. In contrast, Am80&#8208;GCSF synergizes myeloid expansion with effective granulocytic differentiation to generate sufficient numbers of functional neutrophils without causing myeloid overexpansion.</text>

      <text>The numbers of functional neutrophils induced by Am80 are limited (Ding et&#160;al, 2013). Although GCSF stimulates profound myeloid expansion, it cannot effectively differentiate those precursors into functional neutrophils fighting infection (Leavey et&#160;al, 1998; Donini et&#160;al, 2007; Dick et&#160;al, 2008; Ding et&#160;al, 2013). We therefore addressed, in this study, whether and how Am80 can synergistically work with GCSF during granulopoiesis to generate sufficient numbers of functional neutrophils while preventing myeloid overexpansion. We find that Am80&#8208;GCSF sustains active proliferation in normal primary human hematopoietic precursors while inhibiting leukemic growth in primary human AML specimens. However, it ultimately generates functional neutrophils in these different cell types compared to Am80 or GCSF. These functional neutrophils display significantly increased ROS production, enhanced bacterial killing, and altered transcription of RA&#8208;target genes that promote granulocytic differentiation to develop neutrophil innate immunity (Figs&#160;1, 2, 3; Appendix&#160;Figs S1 and S2). Further in&#160;vivo evaluations demonstrate that large amounts of GCSF&#8208;induced neutrophils are functionally immature, incapable of reducing mouse CCIN&#8208;associated infection and mortality (Figs&#160;4, 5, 6, 7). In contrast, although Am80 shows little capacity to promote BM myeloid expansion, the potent effect of Am80 on differentiating granulocytic precursors in CCIN mice (Fig&#160;4) can synergize with GCSF&#8208;dependent myeloid expansion, resulting in the generation of large amounts of functional neutrophils that effectively reduce infection in CCIN mice (Fig&#160;5). Convincingly, different survival tests demonstrate that such Am80&#8208;GCSF synergy, without causing myeloid overexpansion, generates sufficient numbers of functional neutrophils to reduce infection&#8208;related mortality in CCIN mice undergoing perpetual systemic intravenous bacterial infection during a full cycle of mouse CCIN (Figs&#160;6 and 7). These findings reveal a novel Am80&#8208;GCSF synergy, suggesting an advanced therapy that has potential efficacy for CCIN treatment.</text>

      <text>RA&#8208;RAR&#945; signaling is essential for transcriptional control of granulocytic differentiation (Melnick &amp; Licht, 1999; Collins, 2008). Am80&#8208;GCSF selectively modulates RAR&#945; action to alter transcription of RA&#8208;target genes that promote the development of neutrophil innate immunity (Figs&#160;1, 2, 3; Appendix&#160;Figs S1 and S2). Accordingly, neutralizing CR3&#8208;dependent neutrophil innate immunity with specific antibodies eliminates neutrophil bactericidal activities induced by Am80&#8208;GCSF (Fig&#160;1). How does Am80&#8208;GCSF enhance such immunity development during myeloid expansion? GCSF accelerates neutrophil production and induces mobilization and expansion of HSC (Panopoulos &amp; Watowich, 2008). Unfortunately, GCSF is not effective in mediating neutrophil differentiation to develop innate immunity (Figs&#160;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) (Leavey et&#160;al, 1998; Donini et&#160;al, 2007; Dick et&#160;al, 2008; Ding et&#160;al, 2013). It is known that the C/EBP family of transcription factors is important in regulating GCSF&#8208;dependent myeloid expansion and granulocytic differentiation (Panopoulos &amp; Watowich, 2008). Among them, GCSF&#8208;induced C/EBP&#946; is required for GCSF&#8208;mediated expansion of the granulocytic compartment in&#160;vivo (Hirai et&#160;al, 2006), whereas C/EBP&#949; induced by GCSF via C/EBP&#945;&#8208;dependent or C/EBP&#945;&#8208;independent pathways (Nakajima &amp; Ihle, 2001; Numata et&#160;al, 2005; Panopoulos &amp; Watowich, 2008) is involved in mediating GCSF&#8208;dependent neutrophil differentiation. Conversely, RAR&#945; transactivates C/EBP&#949; to regulate terminal granulocytic differentiation (Park et&#160;al, 1999; Lekstrom&#8208;Himes, 2001) while mediating expression of CD66, CD18, and CD11b (Park et&#160;al, 1999; Bush et&#160;al, 2003) that are essential for the development of neutrophil innate immunity (Groves et&#160;al, 2008). Additionally, Am80 is more potent than RA in transcription of C/EBP&#949;, C/EBP&#946;, CD66c, and CD18 (Appendix&#160;Fig S1D). Hence, in balancing GCSF induction of C/EBP&#946; on promoting myeloid expansion, Am80&#8208;GCSF may induce adequate &#8220;emergency&#8221; granulopoiesis by altering RA&#8208;dependent transcription of C/EBP&#949;, CD66, CD18, and CD11b to promote differentiation of granulocytic precursors into functional neutrophils (Fig&#160;8).</text>

      <text>Granulopoiesis demands coordinated proliferation and differentiation of granulocytic progenitors. In normal primary human hematopoietic precursors, Am80&#8208;GCSF synergizes active proliferation with effective granulocytic differentiation to generate significantly larger amounts of functional neutrophils than does Am80 (Fig&#160;1). In contrast, Am80&#8208;GCSF inhibits malignant growth while still producing functional neutrophils in primary human AML specimens (Fig&#160;3). How can Am80&#8208;GCSF modulate such differential processes in normal versus malignant cells? It is known that RAR&#946;2 is a master tumor suppressor (Soprano et&#160;al, 2004; Alvarez et&#160;al, 2007) whereas C/EBP&#949; is a key regulator of terminal granulocytic differentiation (Park et&#160;al, 1999; Lekstrom&#8208;Himes, 2001). Both RAR&#946;2 and C/EBP&#949; are the direct transcriptional targets of RAR&#945; (de The et&#160;al, 1990; Melnick &amp; Licht, 1999; Park et&#160;al, 1999; Lekstrom&#8208;Himes, 2001). Notably, Am80&#8208;GCSF induces significantly higher transcription of both RAR&#946;2 and C/EBP&#949; than does Am80 in the early and late differentiation induction stages in either normal or malignant cells (Figs&#160;1, 2, 3). On the other hand, whereas both GCSF and Am80&#8208;GCSF induce significantly higher expression of RAR&#946;2 and C/EBP&#949; than does Am80 in the late differentiation induction stage of normal cells, only Am80&#8208;GCSF consistently induces significantly higher expression of both RAR&#946;2 and C/EBP&#949; than does GCSF throughout the full differentiation induction period in primary human AML specimens (Figs&#160;1B versus 2Bi and 3Dv). Thus, Am80&#8208;GCSF may differentially modulate expression of RAR&#946;2 and C/EBP&#949; in normal versus malignant cells to synergize granulocytic differentiation with myeloid expansion. Additionally, RAR&#945; is a substrate for cyclin&#8208;dependent kinase&#8208;activating kinase (CAK) complex (Rochette&#8208;Egly et&#160;al, 1997) that cross&#8208;regulates cell cycle with transcription (Rochette&#8208;Egly et&#160;al, 1997; Fuss &amp; Tainer, 2011). RA decreases CAK phosphorylation of RAR&#945;, leading to induction of granulocytic differentiation in both normal and malignant human hematopoietic precursors (Luo et&#160;al, 2007; Wang et&#160;al, 2010; Lou et&#160;al, 2013). Hence, Am80&#8208;GCSF may also induce changes in RAR&#945; phosphorylation to modulate both transcription and cell cycle to coordinate myeloid expansion with neutrophil differentiation. By mapping the resultant transactivation network of RAR&#945; induced by Am80&#8208;GCSF under the modulation of RNAi silencing or gene targeting in normal versus malignant hematopoietic progenitors, future studies should define an array of transcription factors that coordinate with RAR&#945; at distinct developmental stages to differentially regulate production of functional neutrophils.</text>

      <text>Approval for use of primary human specimens was obtained from Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was obtained from all individuals and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Fresh BM and PB specimens were collected from normal human donors and non&#8208;APL AML patients. Lineage&#8208;specific myeloid medium plus 30% human stromal cell&#8208;conditioned medium (MM&#8208;HSCCM), as described (Luo et&#160;al, 2007; Chaudhry et&#160;al, 2012; Ding et&#160;al, 2013; Lou et&#160;al, 2013), was used for culturing primary human specimens. In brief, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Gibco&#8208;BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) was mixed with 20% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma&#8208;Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 10&#8722;4&#160;mol/l 2&#8208;mercaptoethanol (Sigma&#8208;Aldrich), 10&#8722;6&#160;mol/l hydrocortisone (Sigma&#8208;Aldrich), 292&#160;mg/l glutamine (Corning, Manassas, VA), and a combination of 10&#160;ng/ml interleukin&#8208;3 (IL&#8208;3; R&amp;D, McKinley Place NE, MN), 2.5&#160;ng/ml IL&#8208;6 (R&amp;D), 25&#160;ng/ml stem cell factor (R&amp;D), and 30% human stromal cell&#8208;conditioned medium. The MM&#8208;HSCCM sustains myelopoiesis while blocking the growth of lymphoid and erythroid cells in the presence of hydrocortisone and in the absence of erythropoietin. Primary cells were split every 3&#160;days with equal portions of fresh MM&#8208;HSCCM.</text>

      <text>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production of neutrophils was measured by using cellular luminol chemiluminescence (LCL) assay (Wei et&#160;al, 2010) on a luminometer (GloMax@&#8208;Multi Microplate Multimode Reader, Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Two most commonly used ROS stimulators mimicking bacterial infection of neutrophils, fMLP (N&#8208;formyl&#8208;methionyl&#8208;leucylphenylalanine) and PMA (phorbol myristate acetate) (Braga et&#160;al, 2006; Barnes et&#160;al, 2012), were used to induce ROS production. Except primary human PB neutrophils that were directly used for analyzing ROS production, every 5&#160;&#215;&#160;105 cells were cultured for 3&#8211;12&#160;days with corresponding medium (0.2&#160;ml) at least in triplicate in white plastic, non&#8208;coated 96&#8208;well plate (Falcon, Monroe, NC). Immediately before LCL assay, cells were treated with 0.5&#160;mM luminol (5&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;phthalazinedione, Sigma&#8208;Aldrich) in the presence of 4&#160;U/ml horseradish peroxidase (HRP; Sigma&#8208;Aldrich) at 37&#176;C for 30&#160;min, as described (Zhu et&#160;al, 2005). Then, fMLP or PMA was dispensed at a final concentration of 1&#160;&#956;M fMLP (Sigma&#8208;Aldrich) (Barnes et&#160;al, 2012) or 0.5&#160;&#956;g/ml PMA (Sigma&#8208;Aldrich) (Ding et&#160;al, 2013) by the injector built in the plate reader. Baseline value of samples without stimulator was assessed three times immediately before the initiation of reactions in the presence of stimulators. Based on the transient response nature of LCL assay, chemiluminescence was measured sequentially and recorded at 60&#8208;s intervals for 15&#160;min for fMLP plate while 90&#160;min for PMA plate. The relative light units (RLU) were assessed with at least triplicate wells, and the area under the curve (AUC) was used to compare the chemiluminescence changes in control samples.</text>

For antibody neutralization of ROS production, fresh primary PB neutrophils (2&#160;&#215;&#160;105) collected from normal human donors were first incubated with 1&#160;&#956;g/ml (1:1,000 dilution) anti&#8208;CD18, or anti&#8208;CD11b, or combined anti&#8208;CD18 and anti&#8208;CD11b antibodies at RT for 20&#160;min, respectively. In parallel, neutrophils were incubated with 1&#160;&#956;g/ml (1:1,000 dilution) normal mouse IgG as controls. The resulting reaction mixtures were then subjected to the procedures of ROS production assay. For antibody neutralization of bacterial killing, primary PB mononuclear cells collected from normal human donors were cultured with MM&#8208;HSCCM medium for 3&#160;days to induce granulocytic differentiation. Cells were then incubated with 1&#160;&#956;g/ml (1:1,000 dilution) anti&#8208;CD18 antibody for each 2&#160;&#215;&#160;105 cells or 1&#160;&#956;g/ml (1:1,000 dilution) normal mouse IgG for each 2&#160;&#215;&#160;105 cells at RT for 20&#160;min. The resulting reaction mixtures were then immediately processed for bacterial killing assay.</text>

      <text>mRNA was extracted from cells with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and converted into cDNA with RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). qRT&#8211;PCR analysis, as described before (Lou et&#160;al, 2013), was performed in 384&#8208;well optical plates on the 7900HT FastqRT&#8211;PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Amplification condition was set up according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). qRT&#8211;PCR was performed with an initial denaturation at 95&#176;C for 15&#160;min, followed by 40 consecutive thermal cycles (94&#176;C, 15&#160;s; 59&#176;C, 30&#160;s; and 72&#176;C, 30&#160;s) and a final dissociation curve cycle (95&#176;C, 15&#160;s; 60&#176;C, 15&#160;s; and 95&#176;C, 15&#160;s). Each of the samples was assessed at least in triplicate, and the fluorescence intensities were normalized with ROX dye as reference standard. Relative mRNA abundance was calculated with the &#916;&#916;C T method, as described in manufacturer's manual (Applied Biosystems), by normalizing observed Ct values to those of GAPDH and assuming amplification efficiencies of 2. Fold change was then determined by comparing the value of experimental group with that of control group; the values for control samples were represented as 1 in figures, as described (Hansen et&#160;al, 2014).</text>

      <text>Following dose conversion guidelines for human equivalent doses (HED) set by the FDA (www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm078932.pdf), HED of GCSF and Am80 were calculated, respectively (see Fig&#160;4B). Subcutaneous injection of GCSF to neutropenia patients is 5&#8211;10&#160;&#956;g/kg/day for 7&#8211;14&#160;days (Amgen, www.neupogen.com). The calculation equation is (Reagan&#8208;Shaw et&#160;al, 2008): whereas K m &#8208;mouse&#160;=&#160;3 and K m &#8208;human&#160;=&#160;37. This method was also used to estimate HED of Am80. Oral doses of Am80 for APL patients are 6&#8211;9&#160;mg/m2/day for maximum 58&#160;days (Tobita et&#160;al, 1997).</text>

      <text>Animal studies were performed according to the guidelines of protocols approved by CHLA Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Normal C57BL/6J mice (female, 16&#8211;22&#160;g, 6&#8211;8&#160;weeks old) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and randomly divided into different groups for tests. Mice were housed in CHLA institutional animal facility, which had an air&#8208;conditioned environment at 25&#176;C together with a shifting light&#8211;dark schedule of each 12&#160;h. Mice were provided with access to food and water freely. To induce mouse CCIN, as described (Ding et&#160;al, 2013), experimental mice received single 200&#160;mg/kg intraperitoneal dose of cyclophosphamide (CPA, Baxter Healthcare Co. Deerfield, MA) at day 0, while injecting control mice with PBS. Six different models, covering the neutrophil decrease, neutrophil recovery, and a full cycle of mouse CCIN, were used in this study. Regimen treatments for different mouse CCIN models were applied once a day, with Am80 by ig or GCSF by sc or vehicle by ig. To monitor the levels of total leukocytes and neutrophils before or during the experiments, ~50&#160;&#956;l PB was collected from the tail vein of live mice and analyzed with Vetscan HM5 (Abaxis, Union City, CA) by following the manufacture's protocol. Based on different dose&#8208;schedule&#8208;infection models, mice were challenged with bacterial CFU of 6&#160;&#215;&#160;106 (neutrophil decrease model), or 9&#160;&#215;&#160;106 (neutrophil recovery model), or 5&#160;&#215;&#160;106 (survival model covering a full cycle of mouse CCIN), with intravenous injection via tail vein. The different numbers of bacterial CFU used for infecting different mouse CCIN models were determined, respectively, by assessing the lethal amounts of bacteria that induced death of vehicle mice ~24&#160;h post&#8208;infection. The first bacterial infection was for 3 or 16&#160;h or up to 13&#160;days, depending on different models. A possible second infection after 6&#160;days of the first infection was only performed in survival models, by which mice surviving on day 9 were injected with bacteria for 15&#160;min to assess bacterial clearance, neutrophil phagocytosis, and neutrophil maturation. Body weight of mice was recorded every 2&#160;days.</text>

      <text>Mouse PB (~1.5&#160;ml) was collected by cardiac puncture immediately after mouse euthanasia. Neutrophils were purified by use of proportionally reduced volume of Ficoll&#8211;Paque Premium 1.084, as described before (Ding et&#160;al, 2013). The purity of collected PB neutrophils was &gt;&#160;95%, as measured by morphologic analysis with Giemsa stain. Mouse BM cells were collected through flushing femurs with 28&#8208;gauge syringe filled with PBS. BM cells were then purified with gradient Percoll (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). To adequately separate mouse BM cells into different layers containing of more versus less mature neutrophils, Percoll gradient solution was prepared to consist of three densities of 50, 60 and 71%. Mouse BM cells loaded on this gradient solution were centrifuged at 400&#160;&#215;&#160;g for 40&#160;min at RT. Four layers of mouse BM cells generated by gradient separation were subjected to quantitative and granulocytic morphologic analyses. Recovered neutrophils were calculated as follows: neutrophil number&#160;=&#160;total cell number&#160;&#215;&#160;the percentage of granulocytes in total cells.</text>

      <text>Gram&#8208;positive S.&#160;aureus bacteria (ATCC&#8208;27217; ATCC, Manassas, VA) causing bacteremia in neutropenic patients with cancer (Gonzalez&#8208;Barca et&#160;al, 2001) were used to infect mice, as described previously (Ding et&#160;al, 2013). S. aureus were stored at &#8722;80&#176;C in broth containing 50% (v/v) glycerol and renewed every 3&#160;months. For infection, log&#8208;phase growing bacteria (0.3&#8211;0.5 at OD600) were centrifuged at 1,300&#160;&#215;&#160;g for 10&#160;min at 4&#176;C and washed twice with sterile saline. The bacterial pellet was re&#8208;suspended thoroughly with appropriate volume of saline before injection. To monitor the number of bacteria injected into the mice, an aliquot of bacterial suspension used for infecting mice was diluted in a series of 10, 100, 1,000, and 10,000 times (20&#160;&#956;l each), and then plated onto nine blood agar plates for each of dilutions, respectively.

      <text> In vitro bacterial killing was performed as described before (Ding et&#160;al, 2013). To assess in&#160;vivo bacterial killing, PB was collected at different time points from either bacteria&#8208;infected live mice by phlebotomy of tail vein, or through cardiac puncture with 27&#189;&#8208;gauge syringe immediately after euthanasia of bacteria&#8208;infected mice. The samples were centrifuged at 100&#160;&#215;&#160;g for 5&#160;min at 4&#176;C to recover the supernatants containing extracellular bacteria. The equal amounts of supernatant were then enumerated by plating a series of 10, 100, 1,000, and 10,000 dilutions (20&#160;&#956;l each) onto 3&#8211;9 blood agar plates for each of dilutions, respectively. The agar plates were incubated at 37&#176;C for 14&#160;h, and the numbers of viable bacteria at each time point were determined by counting of colonies, as described (Ding et&#160;al, 2013). Spleens or hearts were collected immediately after euthanasia of mice, and rinsed briefly with sterile saline. These organs were then homogenized in the presence of sterile saline (0.05&#160;g/1&#160;ml), respectively. The supernatant was recovered by centrifuging at 150&#160;&#215;&#160;g for 5&#160;min at 4&#176;C. The amounts of bacteria infecting organs were enumerated by plating a series of 1, 10, 100, and 1,000 dilutions of supernatant (20&#160;&#956;l each) onto three blood agar plates for each of dilutions, respectively. The agar plates were incubated at 37&#176;C for 14&#160;h, and the numbers of viable bacteria in spleens and hearts were determined by counting of colonies.</text>

      <text>PB was collected from mice surviving on day 11 by cardiac puncture immediately after euthanasia. PB neutrophils were purified by Ficoll isolation without further hydrolysis of red cells for preserving neutrophil structures. Electron microscopy analysis, as described (Ding et&#160;al, 2013), was performed at CHLA Pathology Research Core. In brief, PB neutrophils were first fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1&#160;M phosphate buffer, and then post&#8208;fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide (OsO4) in 0.1&#160;M phosphate buffer for 1&#160;h, following dehydration processes with series of alcohol. After embedded with epoxy resin in beam capsules and polymerized at 60&#176;C oven for 72&#160;h, the samples were cut into ultrathin section and stained with uranyl acetate and lead. Ultrastructural image of neutrophils were performed on a Morgagni 268 transmission electron microscope.</text>

      <text>Granulocyte colony&#8208;stimulating factor (GCSF) has been the primary drug used for treatment of cancer chemotherapy&#8208;induced neutropenia (CCIN) for over two decades. Although GCSF can profoundly increase the number of neutrophils to reduce the duration of neutropenia, these neutrophils are inadequately differentiated with impaired microbicidal function. Thus, CCIN remains challenging with substantial morbidity and mortality, as well as healthcare cost. Moreover, there is a potential association between the clinical use of GCSF and the development of myeloid malignancy. As such, an alternative mode of treatment is needed for CCIN, which can induce sufficient numbers of functional neutrophils while preventing possible risk of myeloid malignancy.</text>

      <text>Am80 is a retinoic acid (RA) agonist. It enhances granulocytic differentiation by selectively activating transcription factor RA receptor alpha (RAR&#945;) to modulate RA&#8208;target gene expression. We discovered that Am80&#8208;GCSF combination altered transcription of RA&#8208;target genes coordinating proliferation with differentiation to develop neutrophil innate immunity. This led to generation of functional neutrophils capable of fighting infection in both normal and malignant primary human hematopoietic specimens. Specific antibodies against neutrophil innate immunity abolished neutrophil bactericidal activities induced by Am80&#8208;GCSF. Such Am80&#8208;GCSF synergy was further evaluated using six different mouse CCIN models with varying dose, treatment schedule, and duration of intravenous bacterial infection. The results demonstrated that without causing myeloid overexpansion, Am80&#8208;GCSF coordinated myeloid expansion with differentiation to generate sufficient numbers of functional neutrophils that significantly reduced infection and infection&#8208;related mortality in CCIN mice.</text>
