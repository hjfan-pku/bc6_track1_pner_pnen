      <text>Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved process that degrades subcellular constituents. Unlike starvation&#8208;induced autophagy, the molecular mechanism of genotoxic stress&#8208;induced autophagy has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we analyze the molecular mechanism of genotoxic stress&#8208;induced autophagy and identify an essential role of dephosphorylation of the Unc51&#8208;like kinase 1 (Ulk1) at Ser637, which is catalyzed by the protein phosphatase 1D magnesium&#8208;dependent delta isoform (PPM1D). We show that after exposure to genotoxic stress, PPM1D interacts with and dephosphorylates Ulk1 at Ser637 in a p53&#8208;dependent manner. The PPM1D&#8208;dependent Ulk1 dephosphorylation triggers Ulk1 puncta formation and induces autophagy. This happens not only in mouse embryonic fibroblasts but also in primary thymocytes, where the genetic ablation of PPM1D reduces the dephosphorylation of Ulk1 at Ser637, inhibits autophagy, and accelerates apoptosis induced by X&#8208;ray irradiation. This acceleration of apoptosis is caused mainly by the inability of the autophagic machinery to degrade the proapoptotic molecule Noxa. These findings indicate that the PPM1D&#8211;Ulk1 axis plays a pivotal role in genotoxic stress&#8208;induced autophagy.</text>

      <text>Autophagy is a catabolic process in which cellular contents are digested 1. The molecular basis of autophagy has been extensively studied mainly in the setting of the starvation&#8208;induced type, in which functional complexes containing autophagy&#8208;related (Atg) proteins drive for the formation of autophagosomes 2. Unc&#8208;51&#8208;like kinase 1 (Ulk1) is a serine/threonine kinase that forms the Ulk1 complex together with Fip200, Atg13, and Atg101 2, 3. The Ulk1 complex plays a role in the initial step of autophagy by recruiting downstream Atg proteins. In healthy conditions, Ulk1 is phosphorylated and inactivated by mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 and AMP&#8208;activated protein kinase at different serine/threonine residues 4, 5, 6. After nutrient starvation, Ulk1 translocates to pre&#8208;autophagosomal membranes, where it activates the Vps34 complex to generate omegasomes, which are the initial platforms of the isolation membrane.</text>

      <text>Autophagy can be induced not only by starvation but also by several stressors, including genotoxic stress 7, 8. Unlike starvation&#8208;induced autophagy, the molecular mechanisms of genotoxic stress&#8208;induced autophagy have not yet been fully elucidated. Genotoxic stress has been reported to induce the production of several autophagy&#8208;inducing molecules, including DRAM, TSC2, and AMPK 7, 8. Others and we have also demonstrated the transcriptional induction of Ulk1 in response to DNA damage 9, 10. However, the mechanism by which the upregulation of these molecules induces autophagy has not been elucidated yet. To clarify the initial step of genotoxic stress&#8208;induced autophagy, we approached this question from a different viewpoint and investigated the phosphorylation status of Ulk1 because this largely affects its activity.</text>

      <text>In this study, we examined the molecular mechanisms of genotoxic stress&#8208;induced autophagy and identified a key molecule, namely protein phosphatase 1D magnesium&#8208;dependent delta isoform [PPM1D; also called Wip1 and PP2C 11, 12, 13]. PPM1D plays an essential role at the beginning of genotoxic stress&#8208;induced autophagy by dephosphorylating Ulk1. We also demonstrated that PPM1D&#8208;dependent Ulk1 dephosphorylation triggers Ulk1 puncta formation and induces autophagy after etoposide treatment. In thymocytes, PPM1D/Ulk1&#8208;dependent autophagy suppressed genotoxic stress&#8208;induced apoptosis by degrading the proapoptotic molecule Noxa. These findings indicate that the PPM1D&#8208;Ulk1 axis plays a pivotal role in genotoxic stress&#8208;induced cellular responses.</text>

      <text>To clarify the initial step of genotoxic stress&#8208;induced autophagy, we investigated the phosphorylation status of Ulk1, because Ulk1 is crucial at the beginning of starvation&#8208;induced autophagy and is regulated by its phosphorylation. Upon genotoxic stress, the tumor suppressor p53 acts as a master regulator of various biological responses, including apoptosis and autophagy 7, 8, and hence, we speculated that p53 is involved in Ulk1 phosphorylation. We therefore compared Ulk1 phosphorylation between p53&#8208;null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (p53&#8722;/&#8722; MEFs) and its littermate wild&#8208;type MEFs (p53+/+ MEFs) after the addition of etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor. As expected, we found a time&#8208;dependent mobility shift in Ulk1 upon SDS&#8211;PAGE of cell lysates of etoposide&#8208;treated p53+/+ MEFs, but not of Ulk1 from p53&#8722;/&#8722; MEFs (Fig 1A). This suggests that the dephosphorylation of Ulk1 proceeds in a p53&#8208;dependent manner. Given that mouse Ulk1 is phosphorylated at Ser637 (corresponding to Ser638 of human Ulk1) and at Ser757 (corresponding to Ser758 of human Ulk1) by mTORC1 in healthy conditions, we next examined alterations of the phosphorylation status of these amino acid residues. We found that etoposide treatment induces a reduction in the level of Ulk1 phosphorylation at Ser637 (phospho&#8208;Ulk1637) in p53+/+ MEFs, whereas the phosphorylation level was not changed in p53&#8722;/&#8722; MEFs (Figs 1A and EV1). This suggests that p53&#8208;dependent phosphatases target Ser637 after etoposide treatment. Although the mobility of phospho&#8208;Ulk1637 was still observed, this might be because of the presence of other unidentified Ulk1 modifications. The difference in the initial level of phospho&#8208;Ulk1637 between p53+/+ MEFs and p53&#8722;/&#8722; MEFs might be caused by a decrease in Ulk1 kinase activity because of p53 deficiency. Unlike phospho&#8208;Ulk1637, the extent of Ulk1 phosphorylation at Ser757 (phospho&#8208;Ulk1757) was not altered in both types of cells (Figs 1A and EV1).</text>

      <text>To elucidate the molecule responsible for the etoposide&#8208;induced reduction in phospho&#8208;Ulk1637 levels, we focused on PPM1D, because it appeared to be the most likely candidate phosphatase targeting phospho&#8208;Ulk1637, as it is activated in a p53&#8208;dependent manner after genotoxic stress 11, 13. As expected, the level of PPM1D was increased in a time&#8208;dependent manner in p53+/+ MEFs, but not in p53&#8722;/&#8722; MEFs, after etoposide treatment (Figs 1A and EV1). The expression levels of PPM1D changed in a reverse parallel manner to those of phospho&#8208;Ulk1637, suggesting the involvement of PPM1D in Ulk1 dephosphorylation at Ser637.</text>

      <text>To elucidate the involvement of PPM1D in the reduction in phospho&#8208;Ulk1637 levels, we created PPM1D&#8208;null (PPM1D&#8722;/&#8722;) MEFs and control (PPM1D+/+) MEFs from each embryo at day 14.5. In etoposide&#8208;treated PPM1D+/+ MEFs, we observed a time&#8208;dependent mobility shift of Ulk1, a reduction in phospho&#8208;Ulk1637 levels, and an increase in PPM1D (Fig 1B and C) to levels similar to those seen in p53+/+ MEFs (Fig 1A). In contrast, none of these changes were observed in PPM1D&#8722;/&#8722; MEFs (Fig 1B and C). The level of phospho&#8208;Ulk1757 was not altered, irrespective of the presence of PPM1D (Fig 1B and C). In parallel with the increase in PPM1D and the reduction in phospho&#8208;Ulk1637, autophagy was activated in etoposide&#8208;treated PPM1D+/+ MEFs, as assessed by the degradation of the p62 protein and the formation of LC3&#8208;II (Fig 1B and C), both of which are well&#8208;recognized autophagy markers. In contrast, autophagy was less activated in etoposide&#8208;treated PPM1D&#8722;/&#8722; MEFs (Fig 1B and C). Consistent results were obtained when autophagy was analyzed by LC3 puncta formation (Fig 1D and E) and electron microscopic (EM) analysis (Fig 1F and G). The effect of PPM1D on etoposide&#8208;induced autophagy was further confirmed by examining autophagic flux, which is the dynamic process of autophagy. Autophagic flux can be measured by differences in the levels of p62 or LC3&#8208;II between the presence and absence of lysosomal degradation inhibitors, such as bafilomycin A1. A significant difference, which indicates the activation of autophagic flux, was observed in etoposide&#8208;treated PPM1D+/+ MEFs (Fig 1H and I). In PPM1D&#8722;/&#8722; MEFs, the difference was far smaller than that seen in PPM1D+/+ MEFs, indicating a weaker induction of autophagic flux (Fig 1H and I). Although etoposide induces both autophagy and apoptosis, we finished the autophagy assay before the acceleration of apoptosis (see Fig 1A and B: Dead cells (%)), so that the effect of apoptosis could be disregarded. These results indicated that etoposide induced PPM1D accumulation, reduced phospho&#8208;Ulk1637 levels, and activated autophagy in a p53&#8208;dependent manner.</text>

      <text>To confirm the involvement of PPM1D in the reduction of phospho&#8208;Ulk1637 levels and the activation of autophagy by etoposide treatment, we stably expressed Flag&#8208;tagged PPM1D in PPM1D&#8722;/&#8722; MEFs. The exogenous expression of PPM1D in PPM1D&#8722;/&#8722; MEFs restored the reduction in phospho&#8208;Ulk1637 levels as well as the autophagic activation induced by etoposide (Fig 2A and B: p&#8208;Ulk1637, p62, and LC3). Furthermore, when we applied GSK2830371, a recently developed specific inhibitor of PPM1D 14, to PPM1D+/+ MEFs, we observed no reduction in phospho&#8208;Ulk1637 levels (Fig 2C and D) and only a weak induction of autophagy (Fig 2C and D: p62 and LC3) that was similar to that seen in PPM1D&#8722;/&#8722; MEFs (Fig 1B). GSK2830371 has been reported to suppress PPM1D expression 14, and this was confirmed in our Western blot analysis (Fig 2C and D). The involvement of PPM1D was further confirmed by the results that the transient overexpression of PPM1D reduced phospho&#8208;Ulk1637 levels (Fig 2E and F) and induced autophagic flux (Fig 2E and F: p62 and LC3) without etoposide treatment, indicating that PPM1D is sufficient to induce autophagy. Although the expression level of PPM1D in Flag&#8208;PPM1D&#8208;overexpressing PPM1D+/+ MEFs (Fig 2E) was much higher than that in Flag&#8208;PPM1D stably transfected PPM1D&#8722;/&#8722; MEFs (Fig 2A), this was due to the transient overexpression of PPM1D via electrophoretic transfection in the PPM1D+/+ MEFs. Collectively, our results indicate that PPM1D is involved in the reduction of phospho&#8208;Ulk1637 levels and the progression of autophagy induced by etoposide.</text>

      <text>We next examined whether PPM1D binds and dephosphorylates Ulk1 at Ser637. To this end, we first performed an immunoprecipitation assay. As shown in Fig 3A, endogenous PPM1D was co&#8208;immunoprecipitated with an anti&#8208;Ulk1 antibody in lysates from etoposide&#8208;treated PPM1D+/+ MEFs (Fig 3A: lane 8). This interaction was not observed when lysates from healthy cells were used (Fig 3A: lane 7), but this is merely because of the low PPM1D expression level in these cells (Fig 3A: lane 3). When glutathione S&#8208;transferase (GST)&#8208;fused PPM1D was added to healthy cell lysates, we observed a physical interaction between endogenous Ulk1 and GST&#8208;PPM1D (Fig 3B). Functionally, recombinant GST&#8208;PPM1D efficiently reduced the level of phospho&#8208;Ulk1637 in PPM1D&#8722;/&#8722; MEF lysates (Fig EV2A). Consistently, when immunoprecipitated Ulk1 was incubated with GST&#8208;PPM1D, we observed a reduction in phospho&#8208;Ulk1637 (Figs 3C and EV2B: lanes 1 and 2). The level of phospho&#8208;Ulk1637 was restored by the further addition of a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Figs 3C and EV2B: lanes 2 and 3), indicating that PPM1D directly binds and dephosphorylates Ulk1 at Ser637. Unlike phospho&#8208;Ulk1637, the level of phospho&#8208;Ulk1757 was not altered by the incubation with PPM1D (Figs 3C and EV2B). PPM1D primarily localizes to the nucleus after genotoxic stress and dephosphorylates several nuclear proteins 11, 13. We observed small cytoplasmic puncta mainly in the juxtanuclear region of etoposide&#8208;treated PPM1D+/+ MEFs (Fig 3D, arrowheads); importantly, some of them were co&#8208;localized with Ulk1 puncta (Fig 3E: arrowheads). Consistent results were observed when Ulk1/Ulk2 double&#8208;knockout (DKO) MEFs expressing HA&#8208;Ulk1 were treated with etoposide (Fig EV2C). These co&#8208;localized puncta are likely to be where PPM1D dephosphorylates Ulk1. The lack of PPM1D immunofluorescence signals in healthy MEFs (Fig 3D) and etoposide&#8208;treated PPM1D&#8722;/&#8722; MEFs (Fig EV2D) validates our experiment.</text>

      <text>Given that PPM1D dephosphorylates Ulk1 and activates autophagy after etoposide treatment, we examined the causal relationship between the level of phospho&#8208;Ulk1637 and autophagy. To this end, we expressed HA&#8208;Ulk1, a phosphomimetic mutant (S637D), and a phosphodeficient mutant (S637A) in Ulk1/Ulk2 DKO MEFs. We used DKO MEFs to avoid compensation of the Ulk1 deficit by Ulk2, as these cells were reported as autophagy&#8208;resistant cells 15. We in fact did not observe etoposide&#8208;induced autophagy in these DKO MEFs, as assessed by the degradation of p62 and the generation of LC3&#8208;II (Figs 3F&#8211;H and EV2E), whereas it was restored by the expression of HA&#8208;Ulk1 (Figs 3F and EV2E). Restoration of etoposide&#8208;induced autophagy by HA&#8208;Ulk1 was confirmed by the observation of LC3 puncta (Fig 3I and J) and the examination of autophagic flux (Fig EV2F and G). Importantly, the reduction in phospho&#8208;Ulk1637 levels was also observed in exogenously expressed HA&#8208;Ulk1 (Fig 3F). As expected, expression of the HA&#8208;Ulk1 S637D mutant did not restore autophagy, as assessed by p62 and LC3 protein expression (Figs 3G and EV2E), LC3 puncta formation (Fig 3I and J), and autophagic flux (Fig EV2F and G), despite being expressed at levels similar to HA&#8208;Ulk1 (Fig EV2H). These data indicated the crucial role of phospho&#8208;Ulk1637 dephosphorylation in etoposide&#8208;induced autophagy. Expression of the HA&#8208;Ulk1 S637A mutant showed only a weak effect on etoposide&#8208;induced autophagy (Figs 3H&#8211;J and EV2E&#8211;H), suggesting that a dynamic dephosphorylation process may be required for the full induction of autophagy. Note that PPM1D levels were increased to similar extents by etoposide, irrespective of the type of Ulk1 mutation at Ser637 (Fig 3F&#8211;H). All these data indicated that Ulk1 dephosphorylation at Ser637 is crucial for etoposide&#8208;induced autophagy.</text>

      <text>We further studied the detailed mechanism as to how PPM1D regulates autophagy through Ulk1 dephosphorylation. Because Ulk1 puncta formation is one of the initial steps of autophagy 16, we examined the subcellular localization of endogenous Ulk1. Ulk1 was localized diffusely throughout the cytosol in healthy PPM1D+/+ MEFs, and cytosolic puncta formation was observed from 4.5 h after etoposide treatment (Fig 4A and B). This puncta formation was largely suppressed in PPM1D&#8722;/&#8722; MEFs (Fig 4A and C) and GSK2830371&#8208;treated PPM1D+/+ MEFs (Fig 4A and D), indicating that PPM1D is required for etoposide&#8208;induced Ulk1 puncta formation. Similar results were obtained when HA&#8208;Ulk1&#8208;expressing Ulk1/2 DKO MEFs were used (Fig EV3A&#8211;C). Importantly, Ulk1 puncta formation was largely dependent on Ulk1 phosphorylation at Ser637; the number of cells with HA&#8208;Ulk1 puncta was increased time&#8208;dependently in the etoposide&#8208;treated DKO MEFs transfected with HA&#8208;Ulk1, whereas no and weak Ulk1 puncta formation were observed in the MEFs transfected with the S637D and the S637A mutant, respectively (Fig 4E and F). The proportion of cells with Ulk1 puncta (Fig 4F) correlated with the extent of autophagy (Fig 3J). These results indicated that Ulk1 dephosphorylation at Ser637 is crucial for etoposide&#8208;induced Ulk1 puncta formation.</text>

      <text>To investigate whether Ulk1 dephosphorylation at Ser637 also regulates its kinase function, we examined the phosphorylation status of Atg13 at Ser317, which is the target phosphorylation site of Ulk1 17. As shown in Figs 4G and EV3D, phospho&#8208;Atg13317 was not observed in Ulk1/2 DKO MEFs, whereas it was increased time&#8208;dependently after etoposide treatment by the transfection of HA&#8208;Ulk1. This increase was not observed by transfection of the HA&#8208;Ulk1 mutants S637D and S637A (Figs 4H and I, and EV3D), indicating the crucial role of Ulk1 dephosphorylation at Ser637 on downstream Atg13 phosphorylation. Ulk1 dephosphorylation at Ser637 also facilitates the puncta formation of double&#8208;FYVE&#8208;containing protein 1 (DFCP1), which occurs downstream of Ulk1 activation 17. DFCP1 puncta were localized relatively close to Ulk1 puncta (Fig 4J), which is consistent with a previous report 18. As shown in Fig 4K and L, etoposide treatment increased the number of cells with DFCP1 puncta in DKO MEFs transfected with HA&#8208;Ulk1, but DFCP1 puncta were only weakly observed upon transfection of the HA&#8208;Ulk1 mutants S637D and S637A. Taken together, these results indicated that the PPM1D&#8208;dependent dephosphorylation of Ulk1 at Ser637 is required for Ulk1 puncta formation, Atg13 phosphorylation, DFCP1 puncta formation, and the induction of autophagy by etoposide.</text>

      <text>We next examined whether PPM1D and Ulk1 dephosphorylation at Ser637 are crucial for autophagy in general. Unlike etoposide treatment, the induction of autophagy after starvation did not increase PPM1D expression levels (Fig EV4A and B). Furthermore, levels of starvation&#8208;induced autophagy did not differ between PPM1D+/+ MEFs and PPM1D&#8722;/&#8722; MEFs, as assessed by the autophagic flux (Fig EV4C&#8211;F), indicating that PPM1D is not involved in starvation&#8208;induced autophagy. Despite this, we still observed a reduction in phospho&#8208;Ulk1637 levels upon starvation, which was not dependent on the presence of PPM1D (Fig EV4G and H), suggesting the possible involvement of any phosphatases other than PPM1D in starvation&#8208;induced autophagy. PP2A, which belongs to the PP2C family, has actually been reported as such a molecule 19. The crucial role of Ulk1 dephosphorylation at Ser637 was evident in starvation&#8208;induced autophagy because a high level of autophagic flux was observed in Ulk1/Ulk2 DKO MEFs expressing HA&#8208;Ulk1, but was largely suppressed in Ulk1/Ulk2 DKO MEFs expressing the S637D and S637A mutants (Fig EV4I&#8211;K). Note that these phospho&#8208;mutant proteins were not misfolded, but were catalytically inactivated, because they were able to bind to Fip200 and Atg13 to a similar extent to wild&#8208;type Ulk1 (Fig EV4L).</text>

      <text>To generalize the involvement of PPM1D in the dephosphorylation of Ulk1 at Ser637 and the progression of autophagy during genotoxic stress, we irradiated primary thymocytes isolated from PPM1D&#8208;deficient mice and control littermate mice. PPM1D&#8722;/&#8722; thymocytes showed only a slight developmental abnormality (Fig EV5A), as described 20. In PPM1D+/+ thymocytes, we observed the induction of PPM1D, a reduction in phospho&#8208;Ulk1637 levels, and the progression of autophagy (assessed by p62 degradation), and these findings were not observed in PPM1D&#8722;/&#8722; thymocytes (Figs 5A and EV5B), which is consistent with our observations in etoposide&#8208;treated MEFs. Although the results of LC3 Western blotting were ambiguous (Fig 5A), a lower induction of autophagy in PPM1D&#8722;/&#8722; thymocytes than control thymocytes was confirmed when autophagy was assessed using LC3 puncta formation (Fig 5B and C), EM analysis (Fig 5D), Cyto&#8208;ID&#8482; fluorescence (an autophagy marker; Figs 5E and EV5C), and an autophagic flux assay using chloroquine (Figs 5F and EV5D: p62 and LC3). Thus, these results indicate that PPM1D is also crucial for irradiation&#8208;induced autophagy in thymocytes.</text>

      <text>In some cases, autophagy affects the extent of apoptosis 7, 8. Therefore, we examined whether and how PPM1D/Ulk1&#8208;mediated autophagy affects apoptosis. When thymocytes from wild&#8208;type, Ulk1&#8722;/&#8722;, PPM1D&#8722;/&#8722;, and Ulk1&#8722;/&#8722;/PPM1D&#8722;/&#8722; DKO mice were irradiated, we observed increased apoptosis in Ulk1&#8722;/&#8722; thymocytes compared with wild&#8208;type thymocytes (Fig 5G). Consistent results were observed when apoptosis was assessed by Western blotting for caspase&#8208;3 (Fig 5H and I) and by a caspase&#8208;3/7 activity assay (Fig 5J), suggesting that Ulk1&#8208;dependent autophagy plays a protective role against irradiation&#8208;induced apoptosis. PPM1D&#8722;/&#8722; thymocytes were even more susceptible to irradiation&#8208;induced apoptosis than Ulk1&#8722;/&#8722; thymocytes (Fig 5G&#8211;J), but this susceptibility was not further enhanced in Ulk1&#8722;/&#8722;/PPM1D&#8722;/&#8722; thymocytes (Fig 5G). These results may be owing to PPM1D regulating not only Ulk1 but also Ulk2 or other unidentified molecules.</text>

      <text>We further investigated the mechanism by which autophagy suppresses irradiation&#8208;induced apoptosis. Because irradiation&#8208;induced apoptosis occurs via a p53&#8208;dependent increase in proapoptotic BH3&#8208;only molecules, including Puma, Bim, and Noxa 21, 22, 23, and because autophagy may degrade such proteins to reduce the amount of apoptosis, we aimed to identify molecules that are the target substrates of autophagy. The expression levels of Puma and Bim were not altered between irradiated PPM1D&#8722;/&#8722; thymocytes and irradiated wild&#8208;type thymocytes at 3 h (Figs 5A and EV5B). At a later time point, the expression levels of Puma were increased, but we still did not observe higher expression levels in PPM1D&#8722;/&#8722; thymocytes than in wild&#8208;type thymocytes (Fig EV6A). Unlike Puma and Bim, several of our experimental results indicated that Noxa is the target of autophagy in irradiated thymocytes. Firstly, the level of Noxa in Ulk1&#8722;/&#8722; thymocytes was higher than that in wild&#8208;type thymocytes, and the level of Noxa in PPM1D&#8722;/&#8722; thymocytes was much higher than that in Ulk1&#8722;/&#8722; thymocytes after irradiation (Fig 5H and I), which was parallel to the extent of apoptosis, suggesting that autophagy inhibits apoptosis via the degradation of Noxa. Second, chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, suppressed the autophagic degradation of Noxa in wild&#8208;type thymocytes, but not in PPM1D&#8722;/&#8722; thymocytes (Figs 5F and EV5D). Third, immunostaining analysis showed the colocalization of LC3 and Noxa, and more importantly, that the addition of chloroquine increased the number of LC3 puncta colocalized with Noxa (Fig EV6B). Fourth, Noxa contains an LC3&#8208;interacting region (LIR) motif, which ensures the targeting of autophagy substrates to LC3, at the site 99FNLV102. In fact, wild&#8208;type Noxa, but not its LIR mutant Noxa (F99A/V102A), was degraded by etoposide&#8208;induced autophagy (Fig EV6C and D). Fifth, irradiation&#8208;induced Noxa degradation was not observed in thymocytes lacking Atg7 (a core autophagy molecule; Fig EV6E and F). Sixth, the enhanced susceptibility of Ulk1&#8722;/&#8722; and PPM1D&#8722;/&#8722; thymocytes to irradiation was significantly suppressed by the introduction of an siRNA for Noxa (Fig 5K). Note that the silencing of Noxa did not reduce irradiation&#8208;induced apoptosis in wild&#8208;type thymocytes (Fig 5K), which is consistent with previous reports 21, 22. This is thought to be owing to the autophagic degradation of Noxa in wild&#8208;type thymocytes. Collectively, our results demonstrate that PPM1D&#8208;dependent, Ulk1&#8208;mediated autophagy suppresses irradiation&#8208;induced thymocyte apoptosis via degradation of the proapoptotic Noxa protein.</text>

Genotoxic stress induces PPM1D accumulation in a p53&#8208;dependent manner. Then, PPM1D dephosphorylates Ulk1 at serine637, stimulates Ulk1 puncta formation, and induces autophagy. This autophagy contributes to the suppression of genotoxic stress&#8208;induced apoptosis through the degradation of Noxa in primary thymocytes.</text>

      <text>This study demonstrated the essential role of PPM1D in genotoxic stress&#8208;induced autophagy via the dephosphorylation of Ulk1 at Ser637. PPM1D is expressed at low levels in healthy cells and its expression is increased in the nucleus after genotoxic stress. PPM1D mainly functions in the nucleus by the dephosphorylation of various nuclear proteins. In contrast, we showed here that PPM1D also plays a role in the cytoplasm. After exposure to genotoxic stress, a small amount of PPM1D is expressed in the cytoplasm and induces autophagy. Because PPM1D puncta appeared from an early period after etoposide treatment, it is likely not a result of the cell destruction process, that is, an increase in nuclear membrane permeability. Rather, it is likely to be a molecular signal tightly regulated by p53.</text>

      <text>This study also demonstrated that cytosolic PPM1D interacts with and dephosphorylates Ulk1 at Ser637. The dephosphorylation sequence preferred by PPM1D is known as the pSQ site 13, which is present in nuclear substrate proteins. However, the PPM1D target sequence preference is slightly flexible, since it also dephosphorylates the pTGY site in p38, a cytosolic protein 13. In the case of Ulk1, the target sequence at Ser637 corresponds to the pSSQ site, not the pSQ site. Therefore, PPM1D may dephosphorylate sites other than the pSQ site with regard to cytoplasmic substrate proteins.</text>

      <text>In this study, we demonstrated the essential role of PPM1D in genotoxic stress&#8208;induced autophagy, namely its dephosphorylation of Ulk1. PPM1D is an established factor in the negative feedback against the p53&#8208;dependent DNA damage response 13. This function is mediated by the dephosphorylation of and the inactivation of DNA damage&#8208;signaling molecules, such as Chk2, ATM, and even p53 itself 13. Although Ulk1 is not categorized as a DNA damage&#8208;signaling molecule, PPM1D&#8208;dependent Ulk1 dephosphorylation is expected to function as a negative regulator of the p53&#8208;dependent DNA damage response. We first examined whether this type of autophagy might degrade and hence decrease the level of DNA damage&#8208;signaling molecules. However, the expression of these molecules was regulated only transcriptionally and not by autophagy. We next considered whether p53&#8208;dependent apoptosis might be reduced by PPM1D&#8208;dependent autophagy. This hypothesis appeared to be correct; the loss of PPM1D enhanced irradiation&#8208;induced thymocyte apoptosis via both p53 signaling and Ulk1&#8208;mediated autophagy. Thus, one physiological role of PPM1D&#8208;mediated Ulk1 dephosphorylation is to reduce the amount of DNA damage&#8208;induced apoptosis.</text>

      <text>Cells were washed with ice&#8208;cold PBS, frozen, and then lysed in cell lysis buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM Na2P2O7, 10% glycerol, 1% NP&#8208;40, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM Na3VO4, and 1% protease inhibitor cocktail (Nacalai). After vortexing for 15 s, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Supernatants were loaded onto 5&#8211;20, 15, or 8% SDS&#8211;polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the proteins were blotted onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in TBS containing 0.05% Tween&#8208;20 (TBS&#8208;T) and incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4&#176;C. After washing with TBS&#8208;T, the membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase&#8208;labeled secondary antibody and visualized with Chemi&#8208;Lumi One Super reagent (Nacalai). All experiments were conducted at least in duplicate. Protein band densities were semiquantified using ImageJ software.</text>

      <text>GST&#8208;PPM1D was purchased from Abnova (#H00008493&#8208;P01). Cell lysates from healthy MEFs were preincubated with 20 &#956;l of 50% glutathione&#8211;Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) for 30 min at 4&#176;C. After centrifugation at 4,400 g for 3 min, supernatants were incubated with GST and GST&#8208;PPM1D immobilized on new glutathione&#8211;Sepharose 4B for 2 h at 4&#176;C. After washing with 1 ml PBS three times, bound proteins were released from the beads by heating at 100&#176;C for 3 min in 2&#215; Laemmli sample buffer.</text>

      <text>Control and etoposide&#8208;treated MEFs were harvested and lysed with RIPA buffer. Immunoprecipitation was performed using anti&#8208;Ulk1 and control antibodies in the presence of protein G&#8211;Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 2 h at 4&#176;C. The beads were then washed three times with PBS. Proteins were released from the beads by heating at 100&#176;C for 3 min in 2&#215; Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoblotting was performed as described above, except that the EasyBlot anti Rabbit IgG kit (GeneTex) was used.</text>

      <text>Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 8 mM EGTA for 10 min and then permeabilized using 50 &#956;g/ml digitonin for 5 min. Then, cells were stained with the indicated primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the cells were stained with secondary antibodies and Hoechst 33342, mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Life Technologies) and observed using a fluorescence microscope (IX71, Olympus) and a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM510 and LSM710, Zeiss). Thymocytes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 8 mM EGTA for 10 min, pelleted onto slides using a Cytospin3 (Shandon) centrifuge and permeabilized using 50 &#956;g/ml digitonin for 5 min.

      <text>Thymi were prepared from young mice (about 5&#8211;10 weeks old). Primary thymocytes were harvested and seeded onto dishes and maintained in modified DMEM. The cells were X&#8208;ray irradiated (5 Gy), and their viability was determined using PI staining and caspase&#8208;3 Western blotting. To determine autophagic activity, cells were stained with both PI and the Cyto&#8208;ID Autophagy detection kit (ENZO Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The autophagic cells among the PI&#8208;negative thymocytes were detected by flow cytometry (BD; FACS Canto II). Data analysis was performed using BD FACSDiva and FlowJo software.</text>

      <text>Results are expressed as the mean &#177; standard deviation (SD). Statistical evaluation was performed using Prism (GraphPad) software. Comparisons of two datasets were performed using unpaired two&#8208;tailed Student's t&#8208;tests. All other comparisons of multiple datasets were performed using one&#8208;way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test. A P&#8208;value &lt; 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference between two groups.</text>
