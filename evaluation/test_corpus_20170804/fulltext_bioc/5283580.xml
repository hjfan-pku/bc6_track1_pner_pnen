      <text>Protein poly(ADP&#8208;ribosyl)ation (PARylation) primarily catalyzed by poly(ADP&#8208;ribose) polymerases (PARPs) plays a crucial role in controlling various cellular responses. However, PARylation targets and their functions remain largely elusive. Here, we deployed an Arabidopsis protein microarray coupled with in&#160;vitro PARylation assays to globally identify PARylation targets in plants. Consistent with the essential role of PARylation in plant immunity, the forkhead&#8208;associated (FHA) domain protein DAWDLE (DDL), one of PARP2 targets, positively regulates plant defense to both adapted and non&#8208;adapted pathogens. Arabidopsis PARP2 interacts with and PARylates DDL, which was enhanced upon treatment of bacterial flagellin. Mass spectrometry and mutagenesis analysis identified multiple PARylation sites of DDL by PARP2. Genetic complementation assays indicate that DDL PARylation is required for its function in plant immunity. In contrast, DDL PARylation appears to be dispensable for its previously reported function in plant development partially mediated by the regulation of microRNA biogenesis. Our study uncovers many previously unknown PARylation targets and points to the distinct functions of DDL in plant immunity and development mediated by protein PARylation and small RNA biogenesis, respectively.</text>

      <text>In addition to the preformed physical barriers, the innate immune system is essential for sessile plants to ward off potential infections 1. Perception of microbe&#8208;associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) by cell surface&#8208;resident pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) activates the first line of plant immunity, termed as pattern&#8208;triggered immunity (PTI) 2, 3. Bacterial flagellin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), elongation factor Tu (EF&#8208;Tu), and fungal chitin are among well&#8208;characterized MAMPs that elicit robust defense responses in plants. Recognition of flg22, a 22 amino acid peptide derived from bacterial flagellin, by the cognate PRR flagellin&#8208;sensing 2 (FLS2) initiates immune signaling via heterodimerization with brassinosteroid (BR)&#8208;insensitive 1 (BRI1)&#8208;associated kinase 1 (BAK1) in Arabidopsis4, 5. Members of Botrytis&#8208;induced kinase 1 (BIK1) family receptor&#8208;like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) are rapidly phosphorylated by the FLS2/BAK1 complex upon flg22 perception to transduce intracellular signaling 6, 7. BIK1 directly phosphorylates NADPH oxidase respiratory burst oxidase homolog D (RBOHD), thereby contributing to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 8, 9. In addition, MAMP perception triggers rapid activation of mitogen&#8208;activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and calcium&#8208;dependent protein kinases (CDPKs), calcium influx, stomatal closure, callose deposition, and production of antimicrobial compounds and defense hormones 2, 10. The robust defense responses are intertwined with MAMP&#8208;induced massive transcriptional reprogramming which are orchestrated by the coordinated action of gene&#8208;specific transcription factors and the general transcriptional machinery 11, 12, 13.</text>

      <text>Protein poly(ADP&#8208;ribosyl)ation (PARylation) is an important post&#8208;translational modification process that plays a crucial role in a broad array of cellular responses such as DNA damage, cell death, and inflammation 14, 15. PARylation is primarily catalyzed by poly(ADP&#8208;ribose) polymerases (PARPs), which transfer ADP&#8208;ribose moieties from donor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) molecules to target proteins often at glutamate (Glu), aspartate (Asp), or in some cases lysine (Lys) residues, resulting in the formation of linear or branched poly(ADP&#8208;ribose) (PAR) polymers on target proteins 14, 15. PARylation is a reversible reaction and the covalently attached PAR on the target proteins can be hydrolyzed to free PAR or mono&#8208;(ADP&#8208;ribose) by poly(ADP&#8208;ribose) glycohydrolases (PARGs). PAR activities and PARPs have been found in a wide range of organisms from archaebacteria to mammals and plants 16. Similar with their animal counterparts, plant PARPs and PARGs are important regulators in plant growth, genotoxic and abiotic stress responses, circadian clock, and immunity to pathogen infections 16, 17. In contrast to animals, which often contain more than a dozen of PARP family members in the genome, the Arabidopsis genome encodes three PARPs, PARP1, PARP2, and PARP3. Although AtPARP1 bears the highest sequence homology to human hsPARP&#8208;1, which accounts for more than 90% of PARP activities in humans, PARP2 appears to be the most active and important PARP enzyme in Arabidopsis18, 19. Protein PARylation regulates multiple PTI responses, such as immune gene activation and callose deposition. Importantly, MAMP treatment enhances PARP2 auto&#8208;PARylation activity, suggesting that PARylation is an integral part of plant innate immunity 18. However, protein PARylation targets remain largely unknown in plants.</text>

      <text>To identify PARylation substrates, we deployed a high&#8208;density Arabidopsis protein microarray coupled with in&#160;vitro PARylation assays and identified 54 proteins as the putative substrates of PARP2. Several of these candidates were confirmed with in&#160;vivo PARylation assays. DAWDLE (DDL), a forkhead&#8208;associated (FHA) domain protein, was found to play an important role in plant defense responses. DDL was previously reported to control plant growth and development partially via regulating small RNA biogenesis 20, 21. We showed that the ddl mutants exhibited enhanced susceptibility to the infections by several bacterial pathogens accompanied with the compromised MAMP&#8208;induced callose deposition and defense gene activation at late time points. PARP2 directly interacts with DDL in a PARylation&#8208;dependent manner. Mass spectrometry (MS), mutagenesis, and complementation analyses indicate that protein PARylation of DDL is essential for its function in plant immunity, but dispensable for its function in plant development. Thus, we identified DDL as a physiological target of protein PARylation in plant immunity, which is uncoupled from its function in plant development.</text>

      <text>We have previously established in&#160;vitro and in&#160;vivo PARylation assays of Arabidopsis PARPs and PARGs, and demonstrated that PARP2 possesses a robust polymerase activity 18. To identify PARylated Arabidopsis proteins, we employed a high&#8208;density Arabidopsis protein microarray containing 10,048 proteins and performed in&#160;vitro PARylation assays using recombinant proteins of PARP2 fused with maltose&#8208;binding protein (MBP). The protein microarray chips were incubated with MBP&#8208;PARP2 proteins in the presence of NAD+, the donor of ADP&#8208;ribose groups. The chips incubated without NAD+ served as a negative control. After extensive washing, the protein chips were incubated with &#945;&#8208;PAR antibody, which detects the PAR polymer of PARylated proteins, and then Cy3 fluorophore&#8208;conjugated secondary antibody. The fluorescence signals were scanned and imaged by GenePix4100A scanner (Fig&#160;1A). As the same proteins were duplicated as two individual spots on the protein chips, the proteins with both spots consistently exhibiting significantly higher signals than those on the negative control chips were identified as PARylated proteins by PARP2 (Fig&#160;1B, Appendix&#160;Fig S1 and Dataset EV1). We have detected 54 candidates that are likely PARylated by PARP2 using this approach (Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S1). Notably, based on the prediction of protein subcellular localization by TAIR, 56% of candidates are predicated as nuclear&#8208;localized proteins (Fig&#160;1C) compared to 34% of total proteins on the chip to be nuclear&#8208;localized (Dataset EV1), consistent with the nuclear localization of PARP2 18. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicates that proteins associated with DNA/RNA metabolism, response to stresses, response to biotic/abiotic stimuli, and transcription are enriched among candidates compared to the total proteins on the chip (Fig&#160;1D and Dataset EV1). This is consistent with the notion that protein PARylation is often involved in stress responses, DNA damage repair, chromatin modification, and gene transcriptional regulation 22.</text>

      <text>To validate whether some of the candidates are PARylated in&#160;vivo, we transiently expressed the candidate genes with a FLAG&#8208;epitope tag in Arabidopsis protoplasts fed with radiolabeled 32P&#8208;NAD+ as the ADP&#8208;ribose donor. The candidate proteins were immunoprecipitated with &#945;&#8208;FLAG antibody and subjected to SDS&#8211;PAGE autoradiograph. The PARylated proteins were detected as a ladder&#8208;like smear due to the incorporation of radiolabeled ADP&#8208;ribose with different length of PAR polymer formation. As shown in Fig&#160;1E, DAWDLE (DDL, AT3G20550), PLANT TUDOR&#8208;LIKE PROTEIN (AT1G06340), HYALURONAN/mRNA&#8208;BINDING PROTEIN (AT5G47210), and METHYL&#8208;CPG&#8208;BINDING DOMAIN 11 (MBD11, AT3G15790) were PARylated in&#160;vivo compared with the transfection of a control plasmid (Fig&#160;1E) or a FLAG&#8208;tagged nuclear protein, AT5G03660 (Fig&#160;1E, left lane).</text>

      <text>Protein PARylation has been implicated to play an important role in plant defense 18, 19, 23. To determine whether any identified PARylation target candidates are involved in plant defense responses, we characterized homozygous T&#8208;DNA insertional mutants of several candidates in response to the infection by a virulent bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000. Among five homozygous T&#8208;DNA insertional mutants examined (ddl, mbd11, ubc13b, at1&#160;g10520, and at4&#160;g22150) (Appendix&#160;Fig S2A), the ddl&#8208;6 (SALK_045025) mutant exhibited high susceptibility to Pst DC3000 infection compared to Col&#8208;0 WT and other mutant plants (Appendix&#160;Fig S2B). We failed to identify the homozygous mutants for AT5G47210 and AT1G06340 that were PARylated in&#160;vivo (Fig&#160;1E). The transcript of MBD11 and UBC13B was not altered in the corresponding T&#8208;DNA insertion plants (Appendix&#160;Fig S2A). Quantitative RT&#8211;PCR (qRT&#8211;PCR) analysis indicated that DDL transcripts were substantially reduced in ddl&#8208;6 (Fig&#160;2A and B). The bacterial multiplication of Pst DC3000 was more than tenfold higher in the ddl&#8208;6 mutant than that in WT plants 3&#160;days post&#8208;inoculation (dpi) (Fig&#160;2C and Appendix Fig&#160;S2B). The disease symptom development with yellowing and necrosis leaves was more pronounced in the ddl&#8208;6 mutant than that in WT plants (Fig&#160;2C). We also isolated another allele of ddl T&#8208;DNA insertional mutants, ddl&#8208;7 (SAIL_1281_F08), which had about fourfold reduction in DDL transcripts compared to WT Col&#8208;0 plants (Fig&#160;2A and B). The ddl&#8208;7 mutant also exhibited enhanced susceptibility to Pst DC3000 infections compared to WT plants although to a less extend than ddl&#8208;6 (Fig&#160;2C). The previously reported ddl1&#8208;1 and ddl1&#8208;2 mutants in the Ws background were dwarf with severely stunted growth under the 12&#8208;h light/12&#8208;h dark growth condition 20 (Appendix&#160;Fig S3A). However, the severity of growth defects of ddl&#8208;6 and ddl&#8208;7 mutants in the Col&#8208;0 background was less pronounced than that of ddl&#8208;1 and ddl&#8208;2 in the Ws background (Appendix&#160;Fig S3A). Clearly, ddl&#8208;6 and ddl&#8208;7 mutants were much bigger than ddl&#8208;1 and ddl&#8208;2 at 4&#160;weeks after germination when we performed bacterial infection assays (Appendix&#160;Fig S3A). Similar with ddl&#8208;1 and ddl&#8208;2, ddl&#8208;6 displayed delayed flowering and reduced apical dominance compared with Col&#8208;0 WT plants (Appendix&#160;Fig S3B). The ddl&#8208;1 mutant was also more susceptible to Pst DC3000 infections than Ws plants (Fig&#160;2D). In addition, ddl&#8208;6 was more susceptible to another virulent bacterial pathogen P.&#160;syringae pv. maculicola (Psm) ES4326 (Fig&#160;2E), non&#8208;pathogenic bacterium Pst DC3000 hrcC, a type III secretion mutant of Pst DC3000 (Figs&#160;2F and EV1A), and non&#8208;adaptive pathogen P.&#160;syringae pv. phaseolicola (Psp) (Fig&#160;2G). Expression of DDL under the control of the native promoter in ddl&#8208;6 restored the disease susceptibility to Pst DC3000 infection to the WT level in two independent transgenic lines W7 and W18 (Fig&#160;2H). The data indicate that DDL plays an important role in plant defense to bacterial infections.</text>

      <text>To investigate the potential mechanisms underlying the compromised disease resistance in ddl mutants, we systematically examined various PTI responses in the ddl&#8208;6 mutant. Callose deposition is a relatively late response upon MAMP perception. The ddl&#8208;6 mutants showed reduced callose deposits at 24&#160;h post&#8208;inoculation (hpi) with flg22 or Pst DC3000 hrcC treatment compared to WT plants (Fig&#160;3A). Consistent with an important role of protein PARylation in MAMP&#8208;induced callose deposition, the parp1,2 double mutant also showed reduced callose deposits upon flg22 or Pst DC3000 hrcC treatment (Fig&#160;3A). The parp1,2 mutant showed the reduced induction of some early MAMP responsive genes 18. It appears that the flg22&#8208;mediated induction of FRK1, WRKY30, AT1G07160, and AT2G17740 by 1&#160;h did not change significantly in the ddl&#8208;6 mutant (Fig&#160;EV1B). We also investigated the induction of some MAMP responsive genes at late time points, such as 3, 8, or 24&#160;h after treatment 24. Interestingly, the induction of PPDK (AT4G15530), VSR7 (AT4G20110), AT3G08870, and PEN3 (AT1G59870) at 24 hpi after Pst DC3000 hrcC treatment was reduced in the ddl&#8208;6 mutant compared to that in WT plants. The induction of these genes by Pst DC3000 hrcC treatment was also reduced in the parp1,2 mutant (Fig&#160;3B). Similarly, Pst DC3000&#8208;mediated induction of these genes was reduced in both ddl&#8208;6 and parp1,2 mutants (Fig&#160;EV1C). The PR1 and PR5 induction by Pst DC3000 was also diminished dramatically in the ddl&#8208;6 mutant at 24&#160;hpi (Fig&#160;3C), suggesting that DDL is required for regulating some late responsive or secondary defense genes. The ddl&#8208;6 mutant did not affect flg22&#8208;induced BIK1 phosphorylation (Fig&#160;EV1D), MAPK activation (Fig&#160;3D), or ROS burst (Fig&#160;3E), which is consistent with the dispensable role of protein PARylation in these early responses 18. The data suggested that the compromised plant immunity in the ddl mutant might be partly due to altered PTI responses, especially those occurring at the late time points.</text>

      <text>Since DDL is PARylated by PARP2, we further investigated whether DDL directly interacted with PARP2 and whether this interaction is modulated upon MAMP elicitation. We expressed FLAG&#8208;epitope tagged DDL and HA&#8208;epitope tagged PAPR2 in Arabidopsis protoplasts. DDL&#8208;FLAG could immunoprecipitate PARP2&#8208;HA (Fig&#160;4A). Apparently, the association was enhanced upon flg22 treatment (Fig&#160;4A). The flg22&#8208;induced DDL&#8208;HA and PARP2&#8208;FLAG association was also observed when they were transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana (Fig&#160;4B). Consistently, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay also indicated the association of DDL and PARP2 in nuclei with co&#8208;expression of PARP2 fused to amino&#8208;terminal half of YFP (yellow fluorescence protein) (nYFP&#8208;PARP2) and DDL fused to the carboxyl&#8208;terminal half of YFP (cYFP&#8208;DDL) in Col&#8208;0 protoplasts (Fig&#160;4C). JAM3, another nuclear protein 25, did not interact with PARP2 or DDL with BiFC assay (Fig&#160;EV2A). To test whether DDL directly interacts with PARP2, we performed an in&#160;vitro pull&#8208;down assay with PARP2 fused to glutathione&#8208;S&#8208;transferase (GST) immobilized on Sepharose beads as a bait against DDL fused to 6&#215;HIS&#8208;SUMO at N&#8208;terminus and an HA tag at C&#8208;terminus. As shown in Fig&#160;4D, HIS&#8208;SUMO&#8208;DDL&#8208;HA could be pulled down by GST&#8208;PARP2, but not GST itself. Interestingly, when GST&#8208;PARP2 and HIS&#8208;SUMO&#8208;DDL&#8208;HA were first subjected to a PARylation reaction before the pull&#8208;down assay (Fig&#160;4D, right panels), the interaction between DDL and PARP2 was markedly enhanced (Fig&#160;4D, left panels), suggesting that PARylation may enhance the association of DDL and PARP2. The data are in line with the flg22&#8208;induced DDL&#8211;PARP2 association (Fig&#160;4A and B). We have shown that flg22 treatment enhanced PARylation activity of PARP2 18. The enhanced PARP2 activity may promote PARP2 and DDL interaction. Consistent with the direct interaction between DDL and PARP2, PARP2 PARylated DDL in&#160;vitro (Fig&#160;4E). DDL&#8208;FLAG immunoprecipitated from protoplasts could be PARylated by GST&#8208;PARP2 in the presence of biotin&#8208;NAD+ as detected by a Western blot using the streptavidin&#8208;HRP antibody (Fig&#160;4E). The PARylation of DDL, as well as PARP2, could be suppressed by the PARP inhibitor, 3&#8208;aminobenzamide (3&#8208;AB), or removed by GST&#8208;PARG1 (Fig&#160;4E).</text>

      <text>DAWDLE consists of 314 amino acids (AA) with two domains, a divergent N&#8208;terminal domain, DDL&#8208;N (1&#8208;183 AA), and a highly conserved C&#8208;terminal FHA domain, DDL&#8208;C (184&#8208;314 AA) (Fig&#160;2A). We determined which domain of DDL mediates interaction and PARylation by PARP2. As shown in Fig&#160;6A, PARP2 co&#8208;immunoprecipitated with DDL&#8208;N, but not DDL&#8208;C. Similar with the full&#8208;length DDL, flg22 treatment enhanced the interaction of PARP2 and DDL&#8208;N (Fig&#160;6A). Consistently, BiFC assay revealed that cYFP&#8208;DDL&#8208;N, but not cYFP&#8208;DDL&#8208;C, interacts with nYFP&#8208;PARP2 (Fig&#160;EV2B). DDL&#8208;GFP and DDL&#8208;N&#8208;GFP seem to exclusively localize in the nucleus, and DDL&#8208;C&#8208;GFP also largely localizes in the nucleus with some weak signal in the cytosol (Fig&#160;EV2C). In addition, DDL&#8208;N but not DDL&#8208;C could be PARylated in&#160;vivo (Fig&#160;6B). The PARylation of DDL&#8208;N but not DDL&#8208;C by PARP2 was further confirmed by in&#160;vitro PARylation assay with biotin&#8208;NAD+ (Fig&#160;6C). Thus, it is likely that the PARylation residues of DDL by PARP2 mainly reside in its N&#8208;terminus.</text>

      <text>We next deployed a site&#8208;specific proteomics approach, which has been recently developed to characterize the human PARylated proteome 26, to identify potential PARylation residues of DDL by PARP2. PARylation mainly occurs on the Glu (E) or Asp (D) residues of target proteins. In this approach, NH2OH treatment of PARylated proteins resulted in the formation of hydroxamic acid derivative at ADP&#8208;ribosylated Glu or Asp with an addition of 15&#160;Da, an increment that can be readily distinguished by MS analysis 26. We first validated the effectiveness of NH2OH treatment by performing an in&#160;vitro PARylation assay of DDL (HIS&#8208;SUMO&#8208;DDL&#8208;HA) by GST&#8208;PARP2. As shown in Appendix&#160;Fig S4A, after 1&#160;M NH2OH treatment, the smear bands corresponding to self&#8208;modified PARP2 and PARylated DDL were largely diminished, suggesting that the poly(ADP&#8208;ribose) covalently attached to PARP2 and DDL was effectively removed by NH2OH treatment. We then sliced the gel corresponding to the treated HIS&#8208;SUMO&#8208;DDL&#8208;HA proteins (arrow head 2) for MS analysis (Appendix&#160;Fig S4A). In total, we identified eight putative PARylated sites on six peptides (Appendix&#160;Fig S4B&#8211;D). Six residues were located on the N&#8208;terminus of DDL and two on the C&#8208;terminus (Appendix&#160;Fig S4B). We did not detect any PARylated sites on the gel slice with unmodified HIS&#8208;SUMO&#8208;DDL&#8208;HA proteins (arrow head 1 in Appendix&#160;Fig S4A). Among eight identified PARylated sites, E150 is the most confident one, and D105 and E116 are not confident (Appendix&#160;Fig S4C). The residue mass between y7 and y6 in the peptide of 148&#8208;AVeEALAAK&#8208;156 is 144.1, which is about 15&#160;Da bigger than the Glu residue mass of 129.04, suggesting that E150 was PARylated (Fig&#160;6D and E). In addition, the b ion series also support such a modification (Fig&#160;6D and E). Notably, the amino acid following E150 is also a Glu (E151). Two consecutive Glu residues are conserved sites that are often required for protein PARylation 27. We mutated E150/E151 to Alanine (2E mutant) and compared PARylation ability of WT and mutated DDL (Fig&#160;EV3A). Apparently, DDL2E did not affect DDL PARylation with 32P&#8208;NAD+&#8208;based in&#160;vivo PARylation assay (Fig&#160;EV3B). Mutation of some other sides identified by MS analysis, including D32 (DDL1D), D105, and E116 (DDLDE), also did not affect DDL PARylation (Fig&#160;EV3A and C). It is likely that multiple sites are required for DDL PARylation. We generated higher order DDL mutants with mutations in the potential PARylation sites, especially EEs in the N&#8208;terminus (Fig&#160;EV3A). Mutations of two EEs (DDL4E1 and DDL4E2) and four EEs (DDL8E) did not significantly affect DDL PARylation (Fig&#160;EV3B). However, mutations of six EEs (DDL12E1 and DDL12E2, mutation of 12 Glu to Ala) displayed markedly reduced protein PARylation compared to WT DDL (Fig&#160;6F). PARylation of the DDL12E1 mutant after flg22 treatment was almost completely diminished compared to WT DDL (Fig&#160;6F). The protein expression of DDL12E1 or DDL12E2 was comparable with that of WT DDL (Fig&#160;6F). DDL12E1&#8208;GFP still localizes in nucleus (Fig&#160;EV2C). Consistent with the requirement of PARylation for DDL and PARP2 interaction, DDL12E1 showed the reduced interaction with PARP2 compared to WT DDL (Fig&#160;6G).</text>

      <text>To determine the biological functions of DDL PARylation, we transformed the ddl&#8208;6 mutant with either WT DDL or DDL12E1 mutant under the control of its native promoter. Multiple transgenic plants with positive protein expression were obtained, and four representative transgenic lines with similar DDL protein levels were selected for further analysis (Fig&#160;7A). WT DDL transgenic plants (lines W7 and W18) completely restored the disease susceptibility of ddl&#8208;6 to Pst DC3000 infections to the WT level (Fig&#160;2H and 7B). However, DDL12E1 mutant transgenic plants (lines E11 and E15) were still more susceptible to Pst DC3000 infections than WT plants (Fig&#160;7B). The susceptibility of line E15 was similar with that of ddl&#8208;6 (Fig&#160;7B). The Pst DC3000&#8208;mediated PR1 and PR5 induction was also restored to the WT level in WT DDL transgenic plants (lines W7 and W18) but remained substantially compromised in DDL12E1 mutant transgenic plants (lines E11 and E15) (Fig&#160;7C). Similarly, flg22&#8208;induced callose deposition was comparable between WT and DDL transgenic plants. However, DDL12E1 transgenic plants (lines E11 and E15) exhibited largely compromised callose deposits upon flg22 treatment (Fig&#160;7D). Taken together, the data indicate that DDL PARylation is essential for its function in plant defense.</text>

      <text>Interestingly, both WT DDL and the DDL12E1 mutants were able to complement the growth defects of ddl&#8208;6 to the same level (Fig&#160;7A). About 80% of WT DDL and DDL12E1 mutant transgenic plants in the ddl&#8208;6 background displayed the growth phenotype as WT plants (Fig&#160;EV4A). As shown in Fig&#160;EV4B, the transgenic plants with WT DDL (lines W7 and W18) or DDL12E1 mutant (lines E11 and E15) were no longer dwarf compared to ddl&#8208;6, and reached a similar size of WT Col&#8208;0 plants. The individual leaves of transgenic plants were also similar with WT and bigger than ddl&#8208;6 leaves (Fig&#160;EV4C). The W7, W18, E11, and E15 transgenic plants also restored the deficiency of flowering time in ddl&#8208;6 to the WT level (Fig&#160;EV4B). The ddl&#8208;6 mutant also displayed defects in flower and seed development 20. The ddl&#8208;6 mutant exhibited abnormal petal number and aborted ovules. The W7, W18, E11, and E15 transgenic plants restored these deficiencies to the WT level (Fig&#160;EV4D and E). Apparently, DDL PARylation is not required for its function in plant development.</text>

      <text>The growth defects of ddl mutants in the Ws background are in part due to the reduced biogenesis of small RNA, especially miRNA 21. Interestingly, the abundance of several miRNAs, including miR160, miR172*, miRNA166, miR167, miR393, and miRNA398, did not differ significantly between WT and the ddl&#8208;6 mutant by Northern blot (Fig&#160;EV5A). This is consistent with the observation that the growth defects of ddl&#8208;6 in the Col&#8208;0 background were weaker than ddl&#8208;1 in the Ws background. Similarly, the abundance of these several miRNAs was also not changed in the parp1,2 and parg1 mutants (Fig&#160;EV5A). We also performed small RNA&#8208;sequencing of Col&#8208;0 WT, parp1,2, and parg1. The abundance of these several and some other miRNAs did not change dramatically in the parp1,2 mutant (Fig&#160;EV5B) or parg1 mutant (Fig&#160;EV5C) compared to WT plants. The data suggest that protein PARylation may not be involved in the biogenesis of these several miRNAs.</text>

      <text>Although protein PARylation is an essential post&#8208;translational modification in higher eukaryotes, little is known about its targets 26, 28. Our protein microarray analysis coupled with in&#160;vitro PARylation assays identified 54 proteins as PARP2 targets in Arabidopsis (Fig&#160;1A, Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S1). Consistent with a wide range of PARP functions, those candidates are implicated in different cellular responses. For example, DNA polymerase lambda (AT1G10520) and UBC13B (AT1G16890) play a role in DNA damage responses; MBD11 and a plant TUDOR&#8208;LIKE PROTEIN (AT1G06340) are involved in chromatin modification; TIE2 (AT2G20080) and AtOFP14 (AT1G79960) belong to the families of transcription repressors; and several candidates (AT5G47210, AT4G09040, AT3G62310, and AT2G04420) are predicted to have RNA binding or helicase/nuclease activities (Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S1). Importantly, our protein microarray studies may shed light on the potential novel functions of PARylation in plants. Notably, five candidates are involved in protein ubiquitination process with two as ubiquitin&#8208;conjugating enzymes (AT2G32790 and AT1G16890) and two as RING domain&#8208;containing E3 ubiquitin ligases (AT2G24480 and AT3G11110). It is plausible that PARylation regulates the ubiquitination enzymatic activities. In addition, some of targets identified from protein microarray may provide important insights into mechanistic understandings of PARP and PARG functions. Arabidopsis PARG1 is implicated in the regulation of circadian rhythms 29. It has been speculated that certain circadian oscillator components are subjected to PARylation for the control of clock gene transcription. One of the potential candidates might be a CCT (CONSTANS, CO&#8208;like, TOC1) domain&#8208;containing protein (AT5G53420) identified as a PARylation target in our study. TOC1, a CCT domain&#8208;containing protein, is a key regulator in establishing Arabidopsis circadian rhythms 30.</text>

      <text>DAWDLE contains a C&#8208;terminal FHA domain which is a phosphor&#8208;binding domain found in all kingdoms from bacteria, to yeasts, plants, and animals 31. Interestingly, many FHA domain proteins are involved in DNA damage responses and DNA repair, similar with the primary functions that protein PARylation involves. The ddl mutants in the Ws background have severe growth defects with pleiotropic phenotypes 20. This growth defects appear to be partially due to the mis&#8208;regulation of small RNA biogenesis 21. In the ddl&#8208;1 mutant, the expression of several miRNA and endogenous small interfering RNA (siRNA) was reduced. DDL binds to DICER&#8208;LIKE 1 (DCL1) and likely facilitates DCL1 to access or recognize pri&#8208;miRNA 21. Notably, we observed that ddl&#8208;6 and ddl&#8208;7, the T&#8208;DNA knockout lines in the Col&#8208;0 background, exhibit relatively weaker developmental defects than ddl&#8208;1 in the Ws background (Appendix&#160;Fig S3). When grown under the 12&#8208;h light/12&#8208;h dark condition, although ddl&#8208;6 grows slower than Col&#8208;0, the difference between ddl&#8208;6 and Col&#8208;0 is not dramatic at the 4&#8208;week&#8208;old stage (Appendix&#160;Fig S3B). Since the DDL protein sequence from Col&#8208;0 is identical with that from Ws 20, 21, it is possible that a suppressor in Col&#8208;0 weakens ddl defects or an enhancer in Ws potentiates ddl defects. Interestingly, deletion analysis indicates that DDL&#8208;N&#8208;terminus (DDL&#8208;N) interacts with PARP2 and is PARylated by PARP2 (Fig&#160;6). Consistently, the PARylation sites are mainly located on DDL&#8208;N (Fig&#160;6). DDL&#8208;N bears certain homology with proteins in RNA metabolism, and DDL possesses the RNA binding activity in&#160;vitro21, 32. It remains unknown whether DDL PARylation mutants affect RNA binding activity. Apparently, DDL PARylation is not essential for its function in plant development (Fig&#160;EV4). This is consistent with that although the parp1,2 mutant almost completely blocks protein PARylation, the mutant is phenotypically normal (Fig&#160;5) 18, 19. We also did not detect the defect of miRNA expression in the parp1,2, parg1, and ddl&#8208;6 mutants (Fig&#160;EV5). The data suggest that PARylation&#8208;mediated DDL function in immunity is uncoupled from its function in small RNA biogenesis.</text>

      <text>We have shown that MAMP treatment stimulates PARP2 activity in&#160;vivo18. Consistently, flg22 treatment induces DDL PARylation (Fig&#160;5A), which might be the consequence of enhanced PARP2 activity. Apparently, PARylation is coupled with PARP2 and DDL interaction. Flg22 treatment strongly induces DDL&#8211;PARP2 interaction (Fig&#160;4B), and PARylated DDL and PARP2 bind much more tightly than un&#8208;PARylated proteins (Fig&#160;4D). The DDL deletions or mutations that are comprised in PARylation also show the reduced interaction with PARP2. It is likely that PARP2 is activated upon MAMP perception, leading to DLL PARylation, which in turn stabilizes PARP2 and DDL interaction. It will be interesting to determine how MAMP signaling regulates PARP activity. It appears that the PARP transcripts are not significantly induced upon PRR activation. However, human HsPARP&#8208;1 is regulated by multiple post&#8208;translational modification processes, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, and cleavage 22. It remains unknown whether a similar activation mechanism exists for plant PARPs.</text>

      <text>A major function of protein PARylation is to regulate gene transcription through modulating chromatin, functioning as transcriptional co&#8208;regulators or mediating DNA methylation 33. In the Arabidopsis parp1,2 mutant, MAMP&#8208;induced both early responsive genes (FRK1 and WRKY30) and late responsive genes (PPDK, VSR7, AT3G08870 and PEN3) are compromised (Fig&#160;3B) 18. However, the Arabidopsis ddl mutant is only compromised in some of MAMP&#8208;induced late responsive genes (Fig&#160;3B). It is common that some primary immune response genes are activated within minutes, whereas others are activated rather slowly due to different signaling pathways that activate RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) for transcription. The genes that do not require nucleosome remodeling for transcription are usually activated more rapidly than remodeling&#8208;dependent genes 34. Smad nuclear interacting protein 1 (SNIP1), the human homolog of DDL, regulates gene transcription by binding&#160;to the transcriptional co&#8208;activator CREB&#8208;binding protein (CBP)/p300 proteins, a group of histone acetyltransferases, that acetylate histones to relax the chromatin structure for transcriptional activation 35. DDL is also predicted to interact with several Arabidopsis histone acetyltransferases, such as HAC1 and HAC12 36. Modulation of histone modification is an important mechanism for PARylation&#8208;regulated gene expression in mammals. PARylation of human histone lysine demethylase KDM5B inhibits its demethylase activity, thereby maintaining histone H3 lysine 4 trimethyl (H3K4me3), a histone mark associated with active promoters. In addition, HsPARP&#8208;1 promotes exclusion of histone H1 and opening of promoter chromatin, collectively leading to a permissive chromatin environment for the RNAPII machinery loading 37. It remains possible that DDL is involved in PARylation&#8208;mediated chromatin remodeling to create a permissive chromatin environment that allows loading of the RNAPII machinery on the target gene promoters in plant immunity.</text>

The PCR products were digested with BamHI and StuI or SmaI and ligated into the pHBT vector with a FLAG tag at the C&#8208;terminus. The sequences of ORFs inserted in all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The pHBT&#8208;PARP2&#8208;HA and pMAL&#8208;PARP2 constructs were reported previously 18. The DDL gene was further subcloned into a modified pET28a vector with a SUMO tag via BamHI and StuI restriction enzyme sites. pGST&#8208;PARP2 was constructed by subcloning the PARP2 fragment from pHBT&#8208;PARP2&#8208;FLAG into a modified pGST vector via BamHI and StuI restriction enzyme sites. For the BiFC and GFP localization assay, the fragments containing DDL or PARP2 were subcloned into pHBT&#8208;35S::nYFP, pHBT&#8208;35S::cYFP, or pHBT&#8208;35S::GFP, respectively, via BamHI and StuI restriction enzyme sites.

      <text>For in&#160;vitro PARylation of DDL and mass spectrometry analysis, ~100&#160;ng of GST&#8208;PARP2 was mixed with 1&#160;&#956;g of HIS&#8208;SUMO&#8208;DDL&#8208;HA in the PARylation reaction buffer (50&#160;mM Tris&#8211;HCl, pH 8.0, 50&#160;mM NaCl, 10&#160;mM MgCl2, and 1&#215;&#160;activated DNA with or without 0.2&#160;mM NAD+) at room temperature for 6&#160;h. Then, 1&#160;M of NH2OH was added in the reactions to remove PAR from the PARylated residues overnight. This treatment left on the PARylated residues a hydroxamic acid derivative, which has a signature mass increase of +15.0109&#160;Da and could be distinguished by mass spectrometry. The proteins were separated in 10% SDS&#8211;PAGE by electrophoresis and stained with GelCode blue. The gel slices containing unmodified and modified HIS&#8208;SUMO&#8208;DDL&#8208;HA were subject to mass spectrometry analysis as previously reported 38. Briefly, gel bands were in&#8208;gel digested with trypsin overnight, and peptides were enriched for liquid chromatography&#8211;MS/MS analysis with a Q&#8208;Exactive Plus Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). High energy collision dissociation (HCD) was used, and the normalized collision energy was 28. In each cycle, five most abundant ions were selected. The instrument was run in data&#8208;dependent mode with a full MS (400&#8211;2,000&#160;m/z) resolution of 70,000, and MS2 (200&#8211;2,000&#160;m/z) was triggered at a minimal signal of 1,6e5. Dynamic exclusion for 10&#160;s was used to prevent repeated analysis of the same peptides, and a lock mass of m/z 445.12003 (polysiloxane ion) was used for real&#8208;time internal calibration. The MS system was interfaced with an automated Easy&#8208;nLC 1000 system (Thermo Scientific). The peptides were loaded onto an Acclaim PepMap 100 pre&#8208;column (20&#160;mm&#160;&#215;&#160;75&#160;&#956;m; 3&#160;&#956;m&#8208;C18) and separated on a PepMap RSLC analytical column (500&#160;mm&#160;&#215;&#160;75&#160;&#956;m; 2&#160;&#956;m&#8208;C18) at a flow rate at 300&#160;nl/min during a linear gradient from the solvent A (0.1% formic acid (v/v)) to 25% solvent B (0.1% formic acid and 99.9% acetonitrile) in 45&#160;min, ramp to 98% solvent B in 5&#160;min, and then hold at 98% solvent B for additional 20&#160;min.</text>

Briefly, small RNA fragments (~15&#8211;30 nucleotides) were selected and recovered from 10&#160;&#956;g of total RNAs by 15% urea&#8211;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Libraries were made using the NEBNext Small RNA Library Prep kit (NEB, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 3&#8242; and 5&#8242; adapters were ligated sequentially to the small RNAs. Ligated small RNAs were converted to cDNA by reverse transcription followed by PCR amplification for 15 cycles. The barcoded libraries were sequenced in one lane on the Illumina HiSeq 2000. Raw reads were processed by first trimming 3&#8242; adapter sequence using custom Perl script. Reads without 3&#8242; adapter sequence or &lt;&#160;18 nucleotides after trimming were discarded from further analysis. Trimmed reads were aligned against a custom database containing rRNA, tRNA, snoRNA, and snRNAs using Bowtie 0.12.8 to filter out rRNA reads. Non&#8208;aligned reads were subsequently aligned to the Arabidopsis genome (TAIR10) using Bowtie 0.12.8. Genome&#8208;aligned reads were used for all downstream analysis. The small RNA&#8208;sequencing data could be retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data repository at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) with the accession number GSE81366.</text>

      <text>To determine MAPK activation in response to flg22, 10&#8208;day&#8208;old seedlings grown on &#189; MS plates were transferred into a six&#8208;well tissue culture plate containing 2&#160;ml of H2O for 1&#160;day and then treated with 100&#160;nM flg22 for 0, 5, 15, or 45&#160;min. The phosphorylated MAPKs were detected by the &#945;&#8208;pERK antibody (Cell Signaling, USA, 9101) with an immunoblot.</text>

      <text>For ROS assay, at least 20 leaf disks (0.25&#160;cm2 each) were cut from 4&#8208;week&#8208;old plants of each genotype (1&#160;disk/leaf) and incubated overnight in 100&#160;&#956;l of H2O in a 96&#8208;well tissue culture plate. 100&#160;&#956;l of ROS reaction solution (50&#160;&#956;M luminol, 10&#160;&#956;g/ml horseradish peroxidase, with or without 100&#160;nM flg22) was added to each leaf disk after removing H2O. Luminescence was measured immediately with a luminometer (Perkin Elmer, 2030 Multilabel Reader, Victor X3) over a 40&#8208;min time course with a 2&#8208;min interval. The values of ROS production (RLU, relative light units) represent mean&#160;&#177;&#160;SE from 20 leaf disks.</text>
