      <text>Vacuolar ATPases (V&#8208;ATPases) are essential proton pumps that acidify the lumen of subcellular organelles in all eukaryotic cells and the extracellular space in some tissues. V&#8208;ATPase activity is regulated by a unique mechanism referred to as reversible disassembly, wherein the soluble catalytic sector, V1, is released from the membrane and its MgATPase activity silenced. The crystal structure of yeast V1 presented here shows that activity silencing involves a large conformational change of subunit H, with its C&#8208;terminal domain rotating ~150&#176; from a position near the membrane in holo V&#8208;ATPase to a position at the bottom of V1 near an open catalytic site. Together with biochemical data, the structure supports a mechanistic model wherein subunit H inhibits ATPase activity by stabilizing an open catalytic site that results in tight binding of inhibitory ADP at another site.</text>

      <text>The vacuolar H+&#8208;ATPase (V&#8208;ATPase, V1Vo&#8208;ATPase) is a large multisubunit enzyme complex found in the endomembrane system of all eukaryotic cells where it acidifies the lumen of subcellular organelles including lysosomes, endosomes, the Golgi apparatus, and clathrin&#8208;coated vesicles (Forgac, 2007). V&#8208;ATPase function is essential for pH and ion homeostasis, protein trafficking, endocytosis, MTOR, and NOTCH signaling, as well as hormone secretion and neurotransmitter release. V&#8208;ATPase can also be found in the plasma membrane of polarized animal cells where it pumps protons out of the cell, a process required for bone remodeling, urine acidification, and sperm maturation. While complete loss of V&#8208;ATPase function in animals is embryonic lethal (Inoue et&#160;al, 1999), partial loss or hyperactivity of the enzyme has been associated with a wide spectrum of human diseases including osteoporosis (Thudium et&#160;al, 2012), deafness (Karet et&#160;al, 1999), renal tubular acidosis (Smith et&#160;al, 2000), diabetes (Sun&#8208;Wada et&#160;al, 2006), infertility (Brown et&#160;al, 1997), neurodegeneration (Williamson &amp; Hiesinger, 2010), and cancer (Sennoune et&#160;al, 2004), making V&#8208;ATPase a valuable drug target (Bowman &amp; Bowman, 2005; Fais et&#160;al, 2007; Kartner &amp; Manolson, 2014).</text>

      <text>The V&#8208;ATPase couples ATP hydrolysis with the transport of protons across membranes using a rotary mechanism much like the related F&#8208; and A/V&#8208;type ATPases (Futai et&#160;al, 2012) (Fig&#160;1A). In the V&#8208;ATPase from S.&#160;cerevisiae, a well&#8208;characterized model system for the enzyme from higher organisms, energy coupling requires the concerted action of fourteen different polypeptides that are organized into the ~640&#8208;kDa membrane extrinsic V1&#8208;ATPase (A3B3CDE3FG3H) (Kitagawa et&#160;al, 2008) and the ~330&#8208;kDa membrane integral Vo proton channel (ac8c&#8242;c&#8243;de) (Powell et&#160;al, 2000; Zhao et&#160;al, 2015). ATP hydrolysis on the catalytic V1 is coupled with proton pumping across the Vo via a central rotor made of V1 and Vo subunits DFc8c&#8242;c&#8243;d. A peripheral stator complex composed of V1 subunits E,G,H,C serves to stabilize the motor by binding to the N&#8208;terminal cytosolic domain (aNT) of the membrane&#8208;anchored a subunit of the Vo (Fig&#160;1B).</text>

The eukaryotic V&#8208;ATPase is a dedicated proton pump composed of a soluble catalytic sector (V1) and a membrane integral proton translocating sector (Vo). The two functional sectors are linked via a peripheral stator that is formed from the N&#8208; terminal extension of the 100&#8208;kDa membrane integral subunit (aNT), three peripheral stalks (EG1&#8208;3; shown in blue/orange), and subunits C (red) and H (yellow) that are unique to the eukaryotic enzyme.</text>

      <text>Reversible disassembly of eukaryotic V&#8208;ATPase. Cellular signals, such as starvation, lead to a dramatic structural rearrangement wherein the V1 sector dissociates from Vo and subunit C is released from the enzyme. While dissociated, both the V1&#8208;ATPase and Vo proton translocation domain are functionally silenced. This process is fully reversible and upon reassembly, enzymatic activity is restored.</text>

      <text>As a major consumer of cellular energy, V&#8208;ATPase function must be tightly controlled. Regulation of enzyme activity is accomplished by a unique mechanism referred to as reversible dissociation, a condition under which the complex disassembles into cytoplasmic V1 and membrane&#8208;bound Vo (Kane, 1995; Sumner et&#160;al, 1995). As part of the process, the single&#8208;copy subunit C is released from the enzyme and re&#8208;incorporated during enzyme reassembly (Kane, 1995). Upon enzyme dissociation, V1 loses the ability to hydrolyze MgATP (Graf et&#160;al, 1996; Parra et&#160;al, 2000) and the Vo no longer conducts protons (Zhang et&#160;al, 1994), a phenomenon referred to as &#8220;activity silencing&#8221; (Fig&#160;1C). Reversible dissociation of V&#8208;ATPase is well characterized in S. cerevisiae, but more recent data suggest that the mammalian enzyme is regulated by a similar process in some cell types. While yeast V&#8208;ATPase assembly is governed by environmental conditions such as nutrient availability (Parra &amp; Kane, 1998), salinity, or pH (Diakov &amp; Kane, 2010), the situation in animal cells appears to be more complicated in that next to glucose (Sautin et&#160;al, 2005), assembly can be triggered by amino acids (Stransky &amp; Forgac, 2015), cell maturation (Trombetta et&#160;al, 2003), hormones (Voss et&#160;al, 2007), and growth factors (Xu et&#160;al, 2012).</text>

      <text>An important role in regulating enzymatic activity in V&#8208;ATPase is played by the single&#8208;copy subunit H, a 54&#8208;kDa two&#8208;domain polypeptide found at the interface of V1 and Vo (Wilkens et&#160;al, 2004). Subunit H plays a dual role in enzyme function: While H is required for ATP hydrolysis and proton pumping in holo V&#8208;ATPase (Ho et&#160;al, 1993), the same subunit functions to inhibit MgATPase activity in membrane&#8208;detached yeast V1, possibly in combination with product inhibition by ADP (Parra et&#160;al, 2000). The molecular mechanisms by which H functions in silencing MgATPase activity in free V1 are not well understood, however, largely due to the lack of detailed structural information. Here, we present the crystal structure of the autoinhibited V1 sector from S. cerevisiae (ScV1) at 6.2&#8211;6.5&#160;&#197; resolution. The structure shows that regulation by reversible dissociation involves a large movement of the C&#8208;terminal domain of H (HCT) from its position in V1Vo to a position at the bottom of the A3B3 hexamer in ScV1. Together with accompanying biochemical data, the structure provides a mechanism of activity silencing in the membrane&#8208;detached ScV1.</text>

      <text>While subunit C is released into the cytoplasm during reversible enzyme disassembly (Kane, 1995) (Fig&#160;1C), variable but typically substoichiometric levels of C have been seen to co&#8208;purify with ScV1 (Zhang et&#160;al, 2003; Diab et&#160;al, 2009; Hildenbrand et&#160;al, 2010) (see also Fig 5E below). To ensure a homogeneous preparation for crystallogenesis, ScV1 was therefore purified from a yeast strain deleted for the C subunit (Fig&#160;EV1A). Initial crystallization screening identified several conditions that resulted in small needle&#8208;shaped crystals. Crystal size and diffraction quality were gradually improved by refining a subset of the initial conditions together with additive screening. Crystals used for collecting initial datasets were obtained in 100&#160;mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150&#160;mM ammonium sulfate, 12.5&#160;mM magnesium or strontium chloride, and 9.5% PEG 8000 using vapor diffusion or a microfluidic device. A 7&#160;&#197; resolution dataset collected from one ScV1 crystal was used to start the structure determination by molecular replacement (MR) (Table&#160;1). Since there is no crystal structure available for the eukaryotic V1&#8208;ATPase, we employed the structure of the nucleotide&#8208;free A3B3 catalytic hexamer from the E. hirae sodium pumping V&#8208;type ATPase (EhA3B3) (Arai et&#160;al, 2013) for MR. The primary structures of E. hirae and yeast A and B subunits are highly similar (48 and 54% identity, respectively), indicating that the tertiary structures of the bacterial and eukaryotic catalytic subunits are conserved and that the bacterial A3B3 catalytic hexamer represents a suitable MR search model for solving the structure of the eukaryotic V1. The MR with EhA3B3 revealed the presence of two ScV1 sectors in the asymmetric unit (ASU) that were related by twofold non&#8208;crystallographic symmetry (NCS) (Appendix&#160;Fig S1). The density&#8208;modified and NCS&#8208;averaged MR map revealed electron density not only for A3B3, but also for ScV1 subunits D,E,G,H that were either not present in the bacterial complex (E,G,H) or not part of the MR search model (D) (Fig&#160;EV1B). Iterative manual placement of available crystal structures for subunits D,E,G, and H followed by refinement allowed for building of a largely complete model of the ScV1 sector except for subunit F, the base of subunit D and the N&#8208;termini of EG2 and EG3 that were not modeled due to insufficient quality of the corresponding electron density. Crystallization conditions were then further refined (8.25% PEG 8000, 250&#160;mM (NH4)2SO4, 100&#160;mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50&#160;mM SrCl2), resulting in slightly larger crystals that diffracted X&#8208;rays anisotropically to ~6.2&#160;&#197; (Table&#160;1). Diffraction data from two crystals were merged and subjected to elliptic truncation with resolution limits of 6.5, 6.2, and 6.7&#160;&#197; (Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S1). This higher resolution (hereafter referred to 6.2&#8211;6.5&#160;&#197;) dataset was used in MR employing the 7&#160;&#197; structure as search model. The resulting electron density was of higher quality compared to the 7&#160;&#197; data and allowed for modeling of subunit F, the base of subunit D and extension of the N&#8208;termini of peripheral stalks EG2 and EG3 (Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S2). A stereo representation of the final electron density map is shown in Appendix&#160;Fig S2. Note that due to the limited resolution of the diffraction data, all polypeptides used for modeling were truncated at the C&#946;&#8208;position. The more complete model obtained from the 6.2 to 6.5&#160;&#197; dataset will be discussed in detail below.</text>

      <text>The structure presented here represents the highest resolution information available (to our knowledge) for the autoinhibited ScV1 sector and reveals the conformational changes associated with activity silencing and the loss of binding partners at the membrane. ScV1 can be divided into an A3B3DF catalytic core, three EG heterodimers that serve as peripheral stator stalks (hereafter referred to as peripheral stalks EG1&#8208;3) and subunit H, which is unique to the eukaryotic enzyme (Fig&#160;2A). The A3B3DF catalytic core is highly conserved between enzymes from prokaryotes to human and contains the catalytic and non&#8208;catalytic interfaces between alternating A and B subunits arranged as a hexamer around a central cavity containing the central rotor composed of subunits D and F (see section &#8220;Catalytic hexamer and rotary shaft&#8221; below). Each of the three peripheral stalks is bound via its C&#8208;terminal domain (ECTGCT) to the N&#8208;terminal &#946;&#8208;barrel domain of the corresponding B subunit and crosses a non&#8208;catalytic A/B interface on its way toward the base of the hexamer (Fig&#160;2B). However, while the stalks' C&#8208;terminal domains are largely invariant, their N&#8208;termini (ENTGNT) are in different conformations (Fig&#160;2C and D and Appendix&#160;Fig S3A). Previously, we have solved the structure of the isolated peripheral stalk heterodimer bound to the C subunit head domain (EGChead, representative of EG3) in two conformations (Oot et&#160;al, 2012a). In that study, we provided evidence that the EG heterodimers contain two hinges and a partially disordered &#8220;bulge&#8221; region in subunit G that provide flexibility and that we speculated would play an important role in the mechanism of reversible disassembly (Appendix&#160;Fig S3A and B). In peripheral stalks EG1 and EG2, this segment of G is resolved as continuous tubular density, consistent with &#945;&#8208;helical structure. In EG3, however, the density is patchy and flattened, indicating presence of the &#8220;bulge&#8221; structure as seen in isolated EGChead (Fig&#160;2D and Appendix&#160;Fig S3C). Peripheral stalk EG3 is bound to the B subunit of a closed A/B pair and its N&#8208;terminal domain is bent inwards, wrapping around the C&#8208;terminus of the adjacent catalytic A subunit (ACT) (Fig&#160;2D&#8211;F and Movie EV1; see also section &#8220;Comparison of autoinhibited ScV1 and ScV1Vo&#8221; below). This suggests that the bulge in subunit G may be present or absent depending upon binding partners and/or nucleotide bound state of the enzyme.</text>

      <text>The regulatory H subunit can be seen bound to peripheral stalk EG1 via its N&#8208;terminal domain (HNT) while its C&#8208;terminus (HCT) is bound at the bottom of the catalytic hexamer near the rotary D subunit (Fig&#160;2A and C). The interactions involving H are of particular interest, as this subunit has been shown to be essential for silencing the ATPase activity of the isolated V1 sector (see &#8220;Subunit H inhibitory interactions&#8221; below). While the interactions between the peripheral stalks and aNT and C are lost in isolated V1, their interactions with the hexamer and the inhibitory subunit H are preserved. The high affinity of the peripheral stalks for the catalytic hexamer and H, combined with the low affinity for the membrane, results in a V1 sector that can rapidly dissociate from the Vo in response to cellular signals, while keeping its inhibitory subunit bound via one of the peripheral stalks.</text>

      <text>As mentioned above, the catalytic core (A3B3DF) of V&#8208;type rotary ATPases is highly conserved, with primary sequence identities between bacterial, yeast, and mammalian A and B subunits of ~50&#8211;80%, respectively (Muench et&#160;al, 2011). Not surprisingly therefore, the structure of the ScV1 catalytic core is overall very similar to its bacterial counterpart from E. hirae (EhV1) with an rmsd of 2.3&#160;&#197;. As in EhV1, the ScV1 catalytic A and non&#8208;catalytic B subunits are arranged as a heterohexamer with their N&#8208; and C&#8208;termini found distal and proximal to the membrane, respectively (Fig&#160;3A). The N&#8208;termini of both subunits are folded in a &#946;&#8208;barrel, which together form a contiguous &#946;&#8208;structure along the top of the molecule (Fig&#160;3A). Alignment of the A subunits by their N&#8208;terminal &#946;&#8208;barrels illustrates that their C&#8208;terminal domains are in different conformations (Fig&#160;3B), consistent with autoinhibited ScV1 containing one open and two closed catalytic sites as is evident in side views of the three A/B pairs (Fig&#160;3C). From here on, the three catalytic sites will be designated (AB)1&#8208;3, depending on which of the peripheral stalks EG1&#8208;3 is bound to its B subunit, and following this nomenclature, the open catalytic site is (AB)1 and the two closed ones (AB)2 and (AB)3 (Figs&#160;3C and 2E and F). Note that of the two closed catalytic sites, (AB)2 appears more closed than (AB)3 (Fig&#160;3B and C). The presence of two non&#8208;equivalently closed sites has been also observed in the EhV1 (Arai et&#160;al, 2013) and in the cryo&#8208;EM maps of holo eukaryotic V&#8208;ATPase (Zhao et&#160;al, 2015) (see Discussion section below for more detail).</text>

      <text>The central rotor subunit D is an elongated coiled&#8208;coil folded as a hairpin, with the N&#8208;terminus (DNT) located within and the longer C&#8208;terminus (DCT) passing entirely through the A3B3 hexamer (Fig&#160;3A). The ~90&#8208;&#197;&#8208;long DNT helix penetrates the hexamer up to the level of the phosphate binding or P&#8208;loops that are involved in nucleotide binding (Fig&#160;3A). The ~143&#8211;&#197;&#8208;long DCT protrudes from the top of the hexamer by ~10&#160;&#197;, a feature unique to the eukaryotic enzyme (highlighted by the box in Fig&#160;3D). Subunit F is bound to D below the catalytic hexamer via a conserved C&#8208;terminal &#945;&#8208;helix (FCT; Fig&#160;3A) in a manner similar to the prokaryotic enzyme (Arai et&#160;al, 2013). While density for the FCT &#945;&#8208;helix was observed in both of the ScV1 structures solved, only the higher resolution structure allowed modeling of the F subunit N&#8208;terminal domain, suggesting some flexibility or mobility of the subunit.</text>

      <text>Comparing the crystal structures of yeast (ScV1) and bacterial (EhV1) catalytic cores reveals considerable differences regarding the position of the D subunit (Fig&#160;3D). Aligning the structure of autoinhibited ScV1 to available structures of nucleotide&#8208;free and AMP&#8208;PNP&#8208;bound EhV1 (Arai et&#160;al, 2013) using the D subunit as reference illustrates that the eukaryotic V1 is halted in a different rotational position (Fig&#160;3E). The largest angular difference observed (40&#176;) was to nucleotide&#8208;free EhV1, a noteworthy observation as nucleotide&#8208;free EhA3B3 was used as MR search model to solve the structure of ScV1. Besides the difference in rotational position of the D subunit in ScV1 compared to EhV1, the base of the central rotor is bent in the direction of the interaction between the FCT and a B subunit from the hexamer in E. hirae, whereas in ScV1, the base of the central rotor appears to be more straight and shifted toward the C&#8208;terminal domain of the H subunit (Fig&#160;3F). Interestingly, a more straight central rotor is also seen in the ADP&#8208;bound catalytic core from the T.&#160;thermophilus A/V&#8208;ATPase (TtV1; Appendix&#160;Fig S4) (Nagamatsu et&#160;al, 2013), suggesting that the conformation of the DF subcomplex may be influenced by the nucleotide occupancy of the two closed catalytic sites of the complex.</text>

      <text>Subunit H was the first component of eukaryotic V&#8208;ATPase whose structure was solved by X&#8208;ray crystallography (Sagermann et&#160;al, 2001). Subunit H is a two&#8208;domain polypeptide with a larger N&#8208;terminal domain composed of &#945;&#8208;helical HEAT repeats (HNT, residues 1&#8211;351) connected to a smaller globular &#945;&#8208;helical C&#8208;terminal domain (HCT, 356&#8211;478) by a flexible linker (Fig&#160;4A). While the NCS&#8208;averaged and density&#8208;modified MR map showed clear electron density for HNT and HCT (Fig&#160;EV1B), the two domains of H had to be modeled separately because of the considerable conformational change required for HCT to assume its inhibitory position in ScV1 (discussed in &#8220;Comparison of autoinhibited ScV1 and ScV1Vo&#8221; below). The electron density for subunit H is of particularly high quality, showing HNT bound to peripheral stalk EG1 and HCT in contact with the base of the catalytic core (Fig&#160;4A). The interaction between HNT and EG1 is largely mediated by two &#945;&#8208;helical segments in HNT (&#945;&#8208;14 and &#945;&#8208;17, comprising residues 237&#8211;255 and 284&#8211;296) and a short &#945;&#8208;helical stretch in subunit E (residues 26&#8211;44) (Fig&#160;4B). The contacts between HCT and the catalytic core are mediated by a loop in HCT (residues 408&#8211;414) and two short segments in the C&#8208;terminal domain of the B subunit of the open catalytic site (AB)1 (residues around Ile427 and Glu471) together with two &#945;&#8208;helical turns in DNT (residues 38&#8211;45) (Fig&#160;4C). During catalysis, conformational changes in the catalytic hexamer (Fig&#160;3B and C) drive rotation of the central DF rotor (Movie EV2). As the D subunit forms part of the rotor, the site on DNT for the HCT interaction would only be available for binding in this rotational position (Fig&#160;4D). Further, the site on the B subunit for the HCT interaction is only exposed and available for binding in the open conformation of the (AB)1 pair (Movie EV2). From its inhibitory interactions, it appears that part of the mechanism of HCT inhibition is to stabilize the open conformation of the (AB)1 pair specifically, which would have the additional effect of stabilizing the adjacent closed conformations of the (AB)2 and (AB)3 catalytic sites due to the highly cooperative nature of the catalytic sites in rotary ATPases. As we are able to resolve this interaction in the crystal structure, this must be a specific stopping point associated with inhibition of the enzyme.</text>

      <text>The inhibitory interactions between subunit H and the catalytic core are mediated by a loop in HCT (Fig&#160;4C), and surprisingly, while the overall structure and mechanism of eukaryotic V&#8208;ATPase, including its unique mode of regulation, are highly conserved, the loop in HCT that is seen in contact with subunits B and D, is not (Fig&#160;5A). To test the possible role of the loop in activity silencing, we performed mutagenesis experiments together with ATPase activity and growth complementation assays. A schematic representation of the mutations is shown in Fig&#160;5B along with a structural alignment of the&#160;loop region from autoinhibited V1 to homology models of the human V&#8208;ATPase H subunit (HsH) and the HLoop mutant. While the&#160;loop seen in ScH is not present in HsH, it had been shown previously that overexpression of HsH complemented deletion of H in yeast (Lu et&#160;al, 1998). However, we found that expression in yeast of the two splice variants of HsH (HsH1 and HsH2) from a low&#8208;copy plasmid failed to complement the deletion Vma&#8722; phenotype likely due to reduced affinity of HsH for ScV1 (Fig&#160;5C). In separate experiments, however, recombinant HsH splice variants were able to bind ScV1 isolated from a yeast strain deleted for subunit H (ScV1&#916;H) in pulldown assays (Appendix&#160;Fig S5A and B), but subsequent activity measurements to test whether HsH isoforms inhibit ScV1&#916;H's MgATPase activity were inconclusive.</text>

      <text>Experiments in yeast had shown that while HNT expressed from a plasmid is co&#8208;purified with ScV1, HCT is not (Diab et&#160;al, 2009), indicating that the majority of the binding energy between ScV1 and H is provided by the interaction between HNT and EG1. We therefore generated a chimeric H subunit construct containing ScHNT and HsHCT (HChim) to test whether HsHCT can silence MgATPase activity of ScV1 (Fig&#160;5B). Interestingly, while HChim complemented the ScH deletion phenotype (Fig&#160;5C), the chimeric subunit failed to silence MgATPase activity in the purified ScV1 sector (Fig&#160;5D and E). This suggests that the region of HCT that is involved in energy coupling in the holoenzyme is distinct from the portion that functions in activity silencing in isolated V1.</text>

      <text>Sequence comparison between ScH and HsH revealed that while overall identity is only 19%, conservation in the C&#8208;terminal domains is significantly higher (30% identity, 52% similarity). Homology modeling of HsH using ScH as a template predicted that the loop seen in contact with B and D subunits in ScV1 is shorter by three residues and the flanking &#945;&#8208;helices are shortened about one turn (Fig&#160;5B, right panel and Appendix&#160;Fig S5C). To rule out that regions other than the inhibitory loop are playing a role in activity silencing in ScV1, the &#945;&#8208;helices flanking the loop in ScH were each shortened by one turn (&#916;405&#8211;408, &#916;413&#8211;418) to match the local shape of the loop in HsHCT (Fig&#160;5B). While this loop mutant of ScH (ScHLoop) complemented the growth phenotype of the subunit H deletion (Fig&#160;5C), it did not silence MgATPase activity, displaying a specific activity (~9.8&#160;&#956;mol/min/mg) at a level similar to ScV1&#916;H (~12&#160;&#956;mol/min/mg) (Fig&#160;5D). This finding agrees with the results from the chimeric H subunit above and is in line with the HCT loop being important for silencing in ScV1. In addition, the loop sequence in yeast HCT contains a single aspartic acid residue that is present at an equivalent position in all other organisms analyzed (Fig&#160;5A and B). Mutation of this aspartic residue to an alanine (D410A) complemented the deletion phenotype in yeast (Fig&#160;5C) but had little effect on activity silencing when compared to the wild&#8208;type H subunit expressed from a plasmid (Fig&#160;5D). Together, these data indicate that the non&#8208;conserved loop is essential for silencing isolated ScV1, that mutagenesis of the only conserved residue in this region is not sufficient to negate function, and that the dual function of subunit H in activity silencing and energy coupling involves distinct regions in ScHCT.</text>

However, alignment of the two structures revealed significant conformational differences in all the V1 subunits except the A3B3 hexamer (Fig&#160;6 and Movie EV3). While the C&#8208;terminal domains of the peripheral stalks are largely invariant, their N&#8208;terminal domains are in different conformations in ScV1 and ScV1Vo (Fig&#160;6A&#8211;D), in line with their loss of binding partners upon enzyme disassembly (aNT for EG1 and EG2 and subunit C for EG2 and EG3). In ScV1, HNT and the N&#8208;terminal domain of EG1 move outwards toward the periphery of the V1 (Fig&#160;6A and B, and Movie EV3). In addition, a striking change is seen in peripheral stalk EG3 that is bound to the C subunit in the assembled enzyme but binds to the C&#8208;terminal domain of an A subunit of closed catalytic site (AB)2 in ScV1 (Fig&#160;6C and D; see also Fig&#160;2D&#8211;F).</text>

Enlarged view of box&#8208;labeled HCT in panel (C) highlighting the conformational changes and binding interactions of HCT; for clarity only aNT, HCT and the central rotor (DF) are shown. In ScV1Vo, the most C&#8208;terminal &#945;&#8208;helix (dark green) of HCT (green) binds to aNT (light gray), with the inhibitory loop (green spheres) rotated away and inaccessible for binding the B subunit and the central stalk (transparent red). In ScV1, the HCT (yellow) inhibitory loop (yellow spheres) binds to the central stalk subunit D (red) and the B subunit of the open (AB)1 catalytic site. The difference in conformation between ScV1Vo and ScV1 involves a &#732;150&#176; rotation of HCT. Note that the HCT loop (spheres) is rotated away from the central stalk in ScV1Vo whereas in ScV1, the C&#8208;terminal &#945;&#8208;helix (orange) involved in binding aNT is rotated away and unavailable for rebinding to the membrane.</text>

      <text>The most dramatic change is seen in the position of HCT, rotating ~150&#176; from a position in V1Vo where its C&#8208;terminal &#945;&#8208;helix is in contact with aNT to its position at the bottom of the catalytic hexamer in free ScV1 as described above (Fig&#160;6C and E). Interestingly, this change in HCT conformation is accompanied by a repositioning of subunit D to accommodate HCT (Fig&#160;6E). The apparent flexibility of HCT can be further illustrated upon comparison of the available structure of the isolated H subunit to that in ScV1Vo and in ScV1 (Fig&#160;6F). Based on this comparison, HCT undergoes a 180&#176; rotation from its position in isolated H to that in the autoinhibitory conformation in ScV1. The alignment further suggests that HCT can adopt multiple low&#8208;energy conformations and that its flexibility is required for the inhibitory function in ScV1 and for coupling ATP hydrolysis with proton transport in ScV1Vo.</text>

      <infon key="type">paragraph</infon>
      <offset>40865</offset>
      <text>Previous studies have shown that subunit H, specifically HCT, is essential for both inhibition of MgATPase activity in free ScV1 (Parra et&#160;al, 2000; Diab et&#160;al, 2009) and efficient coupling of ATP hydrolysis with proton pumping in holo ScV1Vo (Ho et&#160;al, 1993; Liu et&#160;al, 2005; Flannery &amp; Stevens, 2008). Exactly how HCT performs these dual functions, however, was not understood. In EM reconstructions of holo V&#8208;ATPase (Zhang et&#160;al, 2008; Zhao et&#160;al, 2015), HCT is seen in contact with aNT whereas in the crystal structure of membrane&#8208;detached ScV1 presented here, HCT binds (and thereby links) the B subunit of the open catalytic site and the central rotor subunit D. Remarkably, to transition from its activating position in ScV1Vo to its inhibitory position in ScV1, HCT must undergo a ~150&#176; rotation around the linker connecting HCT and HNT (Movie EV2). It has been shown that when the flexibility of the linker is impaired, subunit H's ability to inhibit MgATPase activity of ScV1&#916;H is significantly reduced (Benlekbir et&#160;al, 2012), indicating that HCT's interaction at the bottom of V1 is indeed responsible for activity silencing. Photochemical cross&#8208;linking on the other hand suggested that activity silencing maybe due to a direct interaction of HCT with the rotor subunit F (Jefferies &amp; Forgac, 2008); however, for&#160;reasons that are unclear, this interaction is not observed in the structure of autoinhibited ScV1 presented here.</text>

      <text>From kinetic profiles of Mg or CaATPase activity assays of ScV1&#916;H or ScV1, respectively, it has been proposed that ADP inhibition may contribute to activity silencing independent of subunit H (Parra et&#160;al, 2000). Interestingly, while ScV1 purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation and ion exchange chromatography contained no bound nucleotide (Parra et&#160;al, 2000), the ScV1 as purified here by affinity chromatography contains ~1.3&#160;mol/mol ADP. ScV1&#916;H on the other hand retained only ~0.4&#160;mol/mol of the nucleotide, indicating that subunit H, by stabilizing an open catalytic site near EG1, leads to increased affinity for inhibitory ADP at another site, which in turn results in activity silencing. Since there are two non&#8208;equivalently closed catalytic sites in ScV1 (Fig&#160;3B and C), it is likely that one of these sites is completely filled and the other partially occupied with nucleotide. The presence of strong positive difference density near the P&#8208;loop in (AB)2 indicates that the inhibitory nucleotide is bound in the closed catalytic site near EG2 and while we cannot assign the&#160;identity of the nucleotide at this resolution, our biochemical measurements indicate that it is likely to be ADP (Appendix&#160;Fig S6). Remarkably, the N&#8208;terminal domain of EG3 is seen to wrap around the C&#8208;terminal domain of the A subunit of (AB)2 and it is possible that this interaction, seen only in membrane&#8208;detached V1, provides yet another mechanism to stabilize the closed conformation of (AB)2 for efficient trapping of inhibitory ADP. Taken together, the data suggest that activity silencing is not caused by a single high&#8208;affinity protein&#8211;protein interaction, but is rather the result of several interactions, which must be readily reversible to allow for efficient enzyme reassembly. Interestingly, inhibition of ScV1 by ScH appears to be mediated by a loop in HCT that is not conserved in other species, and while a chimera of yeast HNT and human HCT is able to complement the Vma&#8722; phenotype of a subunit H deletion, the human HCT does not function in silencing ScV1's MgATPase activity. Whether mammalian subunit H plays a&#160;role in activity silencing similar to yeast H remains to be determined.</text>

      <text>Previous studies have shown that enzyme activity is required for regulated dissociation but not for reassembly or V&#8208;ATPase biogenesis (Parra &amp; Kane, 1998). As this has been shown to be the case even in enzymes that can bind nucleotide, but not hydrolyze it, it has been proposed that the V&#8208;ATPase must adopt a specific conformation during rotary catalysis that favors enzyme dissociation (Muench et&#160;al, 2011). A comparison with the recent cryo&#8208;EM structures of ScV1Vo (Zhao et&#160;al, 2015) showed that autoinhibited&#160;ScV1 resembles the V1 conformation of state 2 (Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S3) with its open catalytic site and DNT near EG1 and HCT. State 2 must therefore represent the conformation where V1 can dissociate from Vo. The comparison also reveals the distinct binding sites on HCT for aNT (in ScV1Vo) and B/DNT (in ScV1), each mediating, as mentioned above, a different function: energy coupling in ScV1Vo and silencing in ScV1, consistent with the biochemical assays presented here involving chimeric and loop mutant H subunits. Besides the different and opposing function mediated by each of these two distinct binding sites on HCT, they appear also to prevent both re&#8208;binding of V1 to Vo when dissociation is favored and prohibit inhibitory interactions from forming when turnover and assembly is required (Movie EV3). For example, it has been shown that ScV1 does not bind aNTin&#160;vitro (Diab et&#160;al, 2009), a result that can be explained by the fact that the most C&#8208;terminal &#945;&#8208;helix on HCT that binds aNT in V1Vo is hidden in V1 due to the 150&#176; rotation of HCT during disassembly. Unintended reassembly may also be prevented by the conformational change of peripheral stalk EG3 that occurs as a result of enzyme disassembly. EG3 is bound to Chead in ScV1Vo, but as subunit C is released into the cytoplasm upon V&#8208;ATPase dissociation, the bent conformation of EG3 seen in ScV1 may help to prevent rebinding of C, which is required for functional association of V1 with Vo. Indeed, V1 purified from yeast cytoplasm or insect midgut has variable levels of C subunit bound, ranging from non&#8208;detectable (Graf et&#160;al, 1996; Parra et&#160;al, 2000) to more&#160;significant amounts (Zhang et&#160;al, 2003; Diab et&#160;al, 2009; Hildenbrand et&#160;al, 2010), consistent with EG3 adopting a conformation unfavorable for Chead binding. Together, the differences in conformations of ScV1 versus ScV1Vo not only allow silencing of ScV1's MgATPase activity but may also serve to prevent functional re&#8208;association of V1 to Vo when the disassembled state is required.</text>

      <text>The structure presented here of ScV1 along with the available structures of V1Vo and biochemical data allow for a more detailed picture of the mechanism of regulation by reversible dissociation. In holo V1Vo, aNT serves as membrane anchor for V1 subunits EG1, HCT, EG2, and Cfoot. We have previously shown that the ternary aNT&#8208;EG2&#8208;Cfoot junction is formed by low&#8208;affinity interactions and we proposed that targeting of one of these interactions by an as yet unknown process would initiate enzyme disassembly (Oot &amp; Wilkens, 2012b). Recently, our laboratory has shown that enzyme dissociation involves a large movement of aNT from its position near EG2 and Cfoot in V1Vo to a position near subunit d in free Vo (Couoh&#8208;Cardel et&#160;al, 2015). We speculate that once the signal is received targeting the low&#8208;affinity aNT&#8208;EG2&#8208;Cfoot junction, aNT changes conformation to bind subunit d, thereby breaking the interaction with H and allowing HCT to rotate 150&#176; to bind to and stabilize the open (AB)1 pair found in state 2 of ScV1Vo (Movie EV4). As the dissociation signal may present itself to the enzyme in any of the three (or more) catalytic states of the enzyme, it seems likely that once state 2 is reached, the conformational changes associated with V1Vo dissociation and silencing of free V1 and Vo are more favorable than maintaining the holoenzyme. The above&#8208;mentioned requirement for ATP hydrolysis in dissociation may serve multiple purposes: (i) achieving state 2 in which (AB)1 and DNT are in proximity to subunit H, (ii) generating the torque needed to break remaining interactions with the membrane sector, and (iii) leaving inhibitory MgADP in catalytic site (AB)2. The model of enzyme regulation proposed here thus couples the dissociation event with activity silencing directly. As regulated disassembly is fully reversible, the enzyme must come together again in a rapid and efficient manner when its function is required. While still unresolved, the pathways involving re&#8208;association have been shown to be distinct from those involved in dissociation. The dramatic conformational changes in ScV1 and Vo subunits as a result of enzyme dissociation may explain the reported inefficiency of direct rebinding of ScV1 to the membrane in&#160;vitro, requiring extreme conditions such as low pH (Parra &amp; Kane, 1996), and may account for the requirement of a dedicated chaperone known as the RAVE complex (Seol et&#160;al, 2001; Smardon et&#160;al, 2002) for reassembly in&#160;vivo. The exact function of the RAVE complex is currently unknown, but there is evidence that the chaperone displays several distinct binding sites for subunits C, EG, and aNT (Smardon et&#160;al, 2015), a subset of the very same subunits that change conformation during regulated enzyme disassembly as described above.</text>

      <text>In conclusion, eukaryotic V&#8208;ATPase is a dynamic molecular machine. The structural model of ScV1 presented here highlights the structural changes occurring in the V1&#8208;ATPase sector as a result of activity silencing and reversible disassembly. Aberrant V&#8208;ATPase activity has been recognized as being responsible for, or associated with many devastating human conditions. Activity silencing and the mechanism of reversible dissociation may thus offer a way to modulate enzyme activity by, for example, the design of molecules that either promote or inhibit the process. These kinds of studies would benefit from higher resolution information, efforts that are ongoing in our laboratory.</text>

The needle&#8208;shaped crystals appeared after ~2&#160;weeks and grew to maximum dimensions of 0.3&#160;&#215;&#160;0.1 &#215;&#160;0.1&#160;mm. Crystals for the 6.2&#8211;6.5&#160;&#197; dataset were obtained using the hanging drop vapor diffusion setup at 10&#160;mg/ml ScV1 in 8.25% PEG 8000, 250&#160;mM (NH4)2SO4, 100&#160;mM HEPES pH 7.5, and 50&#160;mM SrCl2. Since diffraction of the slightly better crystals (visible spots to 6.2&#160;&#197;) was anisotropic, the dataset was submitted to the anisotropy server at UCLA (Strong et&#160;al, 2006) and elliptically truncated to 6.5, 6.2, and 6.7&#160;&#197; as suggested by the server. Completeness of the dataset after truncation is shown in Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S1. The structure from the 7&#160;&#197; dataset was solved by molecular replacement using the A3B3 complex of nucleotide&#8208;free EhV1 (3vr5) (Arai et&#160;al, 2013). The resulting electron density&#160;map allowed modeling of the N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal domains of subunit H (1ho8) (Sagermann et&#160;al, 2001) and the N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal &#945;&#8208;helices of subunit D (3vr5). Cycles of refinement, density modification, and NCS averaging allowed modeling of subunits E and G (4dl0) (Oot et&#160;al, 2012a). The refined model was then used to solve the structure of the 6.2&#8211;6.5&#160;&#197; dataset. The resulting map allowed placement of the base of subunit D and subunit F (4rnd) (Balakrishna et&#160;al, 2015) and extension of the N&#8208;termini of peripheral stalks EG2 and EG3 (4dl0). For both structures, side chains were not modeled due to the limited resolution of the data. Details of the structure determination and refinement can be found in the Appendix&#160;Supplementary Methods. A stereo representation of the final electron density map is shown in Appendix&#160;Fig S2.</text>
