      <text>Seipin is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein implicated in lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis and mutated in severe congenital lipodystrophy (BSCL2). Here, we show that seipin is stably associated with nascent ER&#8211;LD contacts in human cells, typically via one mobile focal point per LD. Seipin appears critical for such contacts since ER&#8211;LD contacts were completely missing or morphologically aberrant in seipin knockout and BSCL2 patient cells. In parallel, LD mobility was increased and protein delivery from the ER to LDs to promote LD growth was decreased. Moreover, while growing LDs normally acquire lipid and protein constituents from the ER, this process was compromised in seipin&#8208;deficient cells. In the absence of seipin, the initial synthesis of neutral lipids from exogenous fatty acid was normal, but fatty acid incorporation into neutral lipids in cells with pre&#8208;existing LDs was impaired. Together, our data suggest that seipin helps to connect newly formed LDs to the ER and that by stabilizing ER&#8211;LD contacts seipin facilitates the incorporation of protein and lipid cargo into growing LDs in human cells.</text>

      <text>Lipid droplets (LDs) are ubiquitous cellular organelles consisting of a core of neutral lipids surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer (Walther &amp; Farese, 2012; Pol et&#160;al, 2014). They are key players in regulating lipid metabolism by storing lipids at times of excess and releasing them upon demand. The currently favored model of LD nucleation is that lipids accumulate within the ER bilayer in spatially restricted subdomains and bud off into the cytoplasm, with a proteomic fingerprint distinct from that of the ER (Ohsaki et&#160;al, 2014; Pol et&#160;al, 2014). LD growth is facilitated by localized activity of biosynthetic enzymes on LDs (Wilfling et&#160;al, 2013). For example, acyl&#8208;CoA synthetase 3 (ACSL3), which generates long&#8208;chain acyl&#8208;CoAs, was shown to control the number and size of LDs (Kassan et&#160;al, 2013), likely by activating fatty acids for neutral lipid synthesis on LDs (Fujimoto et&#160;al, 2007; Poppelreuther et&#160;al, 2012; Wilfling et&#160;al, 2013). After initial formation, LDs retain a functional connectivity with the ER, as manifested by their dynamic cargo exchange (Jacquier et&#160;al, 2011). Furthermore, live cell imaging demonstrated that LDs move in concert with the ER (Targett&#8208;Adams et&#160;al, 2003; Guimaraes et&#160;al, 2015), and electron microscopy (EM) revealed an intimate morphological relationship between the ER and LDs (Robenek et&#160;al, 2006; Ohsaki et&#160;al, 2008; Wolinski et&#160;al, 2011). However, proteins responsible for the maintenance of ER&#8211;LD contacts are so far unknown.</text>

      <text>Seipin/BSCL2 was first identified as a causative gene of Berardinelli&#8211;Seip congenital lipodystrophy 2 (BSCL2), the most severe form of lipodystrophy in humans, characterized by near complete lack of adipose tissue and subsequent metabolic disturbances (Magr&#233; et&#160;al, 2001). While studies in mammalian systems indicate that the protein plays a key role in adipocyte development (Payne et&#160;al, 2008; Chen et&#160;al, 2009), its molecular function remains open. Seipin is a ubiquitously expressed, oligomeric ER transmembrane protein (Binns et&#160;al, 2010). It is evolutionarily conserved, with yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Fld1 being the most extensively studied seipin ortholog. In the absence of seipin/Fld1, LDs appear smaller and aggregated, and sometimes supersized (Szymanski et&#160;al, 2007; Fei et&#160;al, 2008; Boutet et&#160;al, 2009). Several studies have identified aberrant protein composition of LDs in yeast cells lacking Fld1 (Fei et&#160;al, 2011; Wang et&#160;al, 2014; Cartwright et&#160;al, 2015; Grippa et&#160;al, 2015). Fld1 interacts with and stabilizes another ER membrane protein Ldb16 (Wang et&#160;al, 2014), which collaborates with Fld1 to control LD biogenesis and is localized to ER&#8211;LD junctions by immuno&#8208;EM (Grippa et&#160;al, 2015). Moreover, in Ldb16&#916; yeast ER&#8211;LD contacts were enlarged, with conspicuous ER protrusions surrounding aggregated LDs (Grippa et&#160;al, 2015).</text>

      <text>In this study, we characterize ER&#8211;LD contacts and their functionality in wild&#8208;type and seipin&#8208;deficient human cells, including primary BSCL2 patient cells and cell lines harboring WT&#8208; or BSCL2&#8208;causing mutant seipin. We provide evidence that seipin is stably localized to ER&#8211;LD contact sites and regulates the contacts of newly formed LDs with the ER, facilitating the transfer of protein and lipid cargo between them.</text>

      <text>To investigate the role of seipin in LD biogenesis, we knocked out seipin from human A431 cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (Appendix&#160;Fig S1). As reported in yeast (Szymanski et&#160;al, 2007) and human cells (Boutet et&#160;al, 2009), perturbation of seipin function resulted in aberrant LD morphology. After a 3&#8208;day delipidation followed by 1&#8208;h oleic acid (OA) incubation to induce LD biogenesis, LDs in seipin knockout (SKO) cells were more numerous and heterogeneous in size. While some SKO cells harbored 1&#8211;4 large LDs, the vast majority of LDs in SKO were markedly smaller than in control cells (Figs&#160;1A and B, and EV1A). These represented newly formed LDs, as they were not detected after delipidation (Fig&#160;EV1B). Similar aberrant LD morphology was also observed in SKO cells grown in normal growth medium (Fig&#160;EV1C). The content of&#160;neutral lipids was decreased in SKO cells (Fig&#160;EV1D), analogously to BSCL2 patient cells (Boutet et&#160;al, 2009).</text>

      <text>We next investigated the subcellular localization of WT&#8208; and A212P&#8208;seipin&#8208;GFP. Under normal growth conditions, both WT&#8208; and A212P&#8208;seipin&#8208;GFP showed a reticular ER pattern, but WT&#8208;seipin&#8208;GFP exhibited a more punctate distribution (Fig&#160;1C). By stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) using anti&#8208;GFP immunolabeling (Appendix&#160;Fig S2), both WT&#8208; and A212P&#8208;seipin were observed as discrete dotty or disk&#8208;like structures (Fig&#160;1D). The A212P&#8208;seipin&#8208;GFP structures appeared smaller (diameter peak at ~35&#8211;40&#160;nm) than the WT&#8208;seipin&#8208;GFP structures (~40&#8211;50&#160;nm) (Fig&#160;EV1G), likely reflecting their assembly into smaller oligomers, as suggested (Binns et&#160;al, 2010; Sim et&#160;al, 2013).</text>

      <text>To study seipin localization in relation to LDs, we conducted 3D&#8208;structured illumination microscopy (3D&#8208;SIM) on cells with a low level of GFP fluorescence. This revealed that ~95% of newly formed LDs had at least one WT&#8208;seipin&#8208;GFP puncta directly adjacent (Fig&#160;1E and F). The LD size did not clearly correlate with the number of seipin punctae associated with it (Fig&#160;EV1H). Also by immuno&#8208;EM, WT&#8208;seipin&#8208;GFP was enriched at ER&#8211;LD contact sites, contrary to A212P&#8208;seipin&#8208;GFP (Fig&#160;1G and H, and Appendix&#160;Fig S3). Yet, as the sample processing for immuno&#8208;EM partially perturbed the contours of membrane bound organelles, these data should be interpreted with caution.</text>

      <text>Finally, to investigate endogenous seipin localization, we tagged the protein at its chromosomal locus (end&#8208;seipin&#8208;sfGFP; Appendix&#160;Fig S4). This confirmed the specific association of seipin at ER&#8211;LD contact sites (Fig&#160;1I), with virtually all LDs harboring at least one seipin punctum. Thus, both WT&#8208;seipin and a BSCL2&#8208;causing point mutant form discrete structures in the ER, but the WT protein is highly enriched at ER&#8211;LD contact sites while the mutant is not, arguing for the functional relevance of this location.</text>

      <text>To characterize the dynamics of seipin localization, we performed high&#8208;resolution imaging of live cells. Upon incubation with OA for 30&#8211;75&#160;min to induce LD biogenesis, two populations of WT&#8208;seipin&#8208;GFP puncta were apparent: those associated with LDs and those without LD associations. Both populations were mobile but the latter displayed considerably faster movements (Figs&#160;2A and B, and EV2A). The association of seipin&#8208;GFP with LDs appeared stable during the observation period (up to 120&#160;s) with seipin&#8208;GFP dots hovering around the LD (Movie EV1) or moving together with it (Fig&#160;2A, lower panel). Thus, LDs exhibit a close physical relationship with the ER, with seipin stably localizing at the ER&#8211;LD junctions.</text>

      <text>We next examined the dynamics of LDs in WT and SKO cells. In control cells treated with OA for 45&#8211;60&#160;min, LDs were often relatively immobile, with occasional short bouts of faster, unidirectional movement likely representing LD transport along microtubules (Targett&#8208;Adams et&#160;al, 2003; Shubeita et&#160;al, 2008; Herms et&#160;al, 2015). In SKO cells, LD mobility was increased, with some of the small LDs displaying strikingly aberrant multidirectional trajectories, and high mean and maximum velocities (Figs&#160;2C&#8211;E and EV2B and C, and Movie EV2). This phenomenon was also observed in LDs formed under normal growth conditions (Fig&#160;EV2D&#8211;F).</text>

      <text>We then imaged the movement of newly formed LDs in relation to the ER, focusing on peripheral areas of the cells where the ER network was less dense allowing better visualization. In control cells, two modes of LD movement relative to the ER were observed: (i) LDs that appeared stably associated with the ER and moved together with it and (ii) LDs that traveled vectorially along the ER (Fig&#160;2F&#8211;H and Movie EV3). Remarkably, in SKO cells, some LDs also moved independently of the ER and with higher velocities (Figs&#160;2F&#8211;H and EV2G, and Movie EV3). This ER&#8208;independent LD mobility was rescued upon stable expression of WT&#8208; but not A212P&#8208;seipin&#8208;GFP (Fig&#160;EV2H).</text>

      <text>To confirm the apparent loss of ER&#8211;LD contacts in SKO cells, we examined the 3D ultrastructure of LDs in WT and SKO cells using serial block&#8208;face scanning EM (SB&#8208;EM). For cytochemical staining of the ER, we generated cell lines expressing Hsp47, an ER&#8208;resident chaperone (Kano et&#160;al, 2005) fused with APEX, an EM reporter (Martell et&#160;al, 2012). Delipidated WT and SKO cells were treated with OA for 1&#160;h and imaged using SB&#8208;EM, and ER and LD profiles were modeled (Fig&#160;2I). We found that the vast majority of LDs in SKO cells were smaller and more homogeneous in size (~200&#160;nm diameter) than in WT cells (Fig&#160;2J). Within the resolution of the system (~20&#160;nm in XY, ~40&#160;nm in Z), all LDs in WT cells were in close proximity to the ER, as judged by the continuity of the LD profile with the ER profile. Strikingly, in SKO cells a subset of the small LDs (about 10% of LDs per region of interest) showed no contact with the ER, with their distance to closest ER membranes ranging from 20 to up to 460&#160;nm (Figs&#160;2K and EV3A). In contrast, all the large LDs visualized from SKO cells were in the proximity of the ER (Fig&#160;EV3B).</text>

      <text>We next examined the detailed morphology of ER&#8211;LD junctions in WT and SKO cells using electron tomography (ET; digital isotropic resolution ~2.8&#160;nm). The ER&#8211;LD contacts of WT cells appeared well&#8208;delineated and morphologically uniform: the ER typically formed a foot&#8208;like process that touched the LD surface within a small area (Fig&#160;3A), in accordance with earlier findings (Kassan et&#160;al, 2013; Wilfling et&#160;al, 2013). At such contacts, the membrane profile often appeared darker and thicker, but we did not observe direct membrane continuities between the ER and LD membranes. 3D modeling revealed several discrete patch&#8208;like ER contacts per LD (Fig&#160;3B and Movies EV4 and EV5). In contrast, in SKO cells, the contacts appeared heterogeneous and irregular. Some LDs exhibited very extensive ER contacts (Fig&#160;3A), with modeling showing a web&#8208;like ER attachment (Fig&#160;3B and Movies EV6 and EV7), while others (~20%) displayed narrow, string&#8208;like bridges to the ER that were not observed in control cells (Fig&#160;3A). When the extent of ER&#8211;LD contacts was evaluated, we found a striking heterogeneity in the extent of ER&#8211;LD contacts in SKO cells (total ER&#8211;LD contact area per LD: 0.022&#8211;0.053&#160;&#956;m2 in WT cells vs. 0.012&#8211;0.105&#160;&#956;m2 in SKO cells, n&#160;=&#160;4&#8211;5 LDs). As the SKO LDs were smaller, the fraction of the LD surface associated with the ER was, on average, larger in SKO cells (3.2&#160;&#177;&#160;1.7% of total LD area in WT vs. 9.5&#160;&#177;&#160;4.5% in SKO, &#177;&#160;SD). Also with this resolution, a complete LD profile with no ER contact was recorded in SKO cells (Movie EV8). Together, these data suggest that seipin controls the extent of ER&#8211;LD contacts, as seipin loss is accompanied by missing, rudimentary, or very large ER&#8211;LD contacts.</text>

      <text>When assessing the ER ultrastructure, we noted that in SKO cells, the ER appeared occasionally expanded in the vicinity of LDs (Fig&#160;3A). To address whether this was restricted to ER&#8211;LD contact sites, we performed TEM of cells incubated with OA for 1&#160;h. This revealed a significant widening of the overall ER diameter in SKO cells (width of ~40&#160;nm in WT cells vs. ~50&#160;nm in SKO cells; Fig&#160;3C and D).</text>

      <text>We next investigated how select LD proteins associate with LDs in WT and SKO cells. To this end, we generated WT and SKO cells expressing ACSL3&#8208;Cherry, an ER membrane protein that marks lipogenic ER subdomains and nascent LDs (Kassan et&#160;al, 2013). In these cells, we also transiently expressed a GFP&#8208;fused adipose&#8208;differentiation&#8208;related protein (ADRP), which is recruited to LDs from the cytoplasm (Brasaemle et&#160;al, 1997). Upon 1&#8208;h incubation with OA, ADRP&#8208;GFP was efficiently recruited to newly formed LDs in both WT and SKO cells (Fig&#160;4A and B). In WT cells, ACSL3&#8208;Cherry partially retained a reticular pattern, but additionally localized to the newly formed LDs. In contrast, in SKO cells ACSL3&#8208;Cherry did not concentrate on LDs but remained almost exclusively in the ER (Fig&#160;4A and B). Similar results were obtained in live cells when these proteins were expressed individually (Fig&#160;EV4A).</text>

      <text>To further characterize defective ACSL3 trafficking in the absence of seipin, we conducted cell fusion experiments. We fused cells expressing ADRP&#8208;GFP on newly formed LDs with delipidated cells lacking LDs and containing ACSL3&#8208;Cherry in the ER. When both cell pools represented WT genotype, ACSL3 recruitment to ADRP&#8208;labeled LDs was readily evident (Fig&#160;4C and D). This suggests that cell fusion and subsequent fusion of ER membranes (Kaprielian et&#160;al, 1996) allowed ACSL3 to move via ER&#8211;LD contacts to the surface of LDs. In contrast, this recruitment was perturbed when SKO cells were fused together (Fig&#160;4C and D). However, ACSL3 derived from SKO ER did gain access to WT LDs (Fig&#160;4C and D), likely because of functional ER&#8211;LD contacts preserved in WT cells. Strikingly, LDs generated in SKO cells failed to recruit ACSL3 deriving from a WT ER (Fig&#160;4C and D). This suggests that seipin needs to be present during LD formation, as reintroducing seipin to SKO cells with pre&#8208;existing LDs failed to facilitate ACSL3 LD recruitment.</text>

      <text>We next examined the distribution of endogenous ACSL3 (Fig&#160;EV4B). In delipidated cells, ACSL3 showed a reticular staining pattern with fine punctae, suggesting localization in a lipogenic ER subdomain (Kassan et&#160;al, 2013). These domains were largely segregated from areas marked by WT&#8208;seipin&#8208;GFP (Fig&#160;EV4C). A 15&#8208;min treatment with OA caused the appearance of more prominent ACSL3 punctae, likely representing newly forming LDs (Kassan et&#160;al, 2013). In these conditions, WT&#8208;seipin&#8208;GFP punctae were observed in close apposition and partly overlapping with the ACSL3 signal (Fig&#160;EV4C). Upon 1&#8208;h OA loading of WT cells, endogenous ACSL3 was observed mostly in ring&#8208;like structures surrounding small LDs or in dot&#8208;like structures completely overlapping with them (Fig&#160;4E and F). Virtually all LDs showed a clear accumulation of ACSL3. In contrast, in SKO cells ACSL3 did not accumulate on the surfaces of small LDs but often concentrated on one side of them (Fig&#160;4E and F). The few LDs in SKO cells that harbored ring&#8208;like ACSL3 staining were &gt;&#160;0.5&#160;&#956;m in diameter. This ACSL3 mistargeting was rescued in SKO cells expressing WT&#8208;, but not A212P&#8208;seipin&#8208;GFP (Fig&#160;EV4D and E).</text>

      <text>To address endogenous ACSL3 localization in more detail, we performed immuno&#8208;EM. In WT cells treated with OA for 1&#160;h, ACSL3 labeling typically decorated the cytoplasmic side of the LD surface (Fig&#160;4G), indicating localization on the LD phospholipid monolayer. In SKO cells, ACSL3 labeling was often restricted to ER&#8211;LD junctions, with the cytoplasmic face of LDs devoid of signal (Fig&#160;4G). Image analysis of WT cells revealed ACSL3 localization on the LD monolayer and LD&#8208;ER contacts, whereas in SKO cells, 18% of LDs showed ACSL3 label exclusively at the ER&#8211;LD junctions and 30% of LDs were completely devoid of ACSL3, showing labeling only outside the LDs in the ER (Fig&#160;4H).</text>

      <text>Acyl&#8208;CoA synthetase 3 localization to LDs depends on its N&#8208;terminal hydrophobic region postulated to form an alpha&#8208;helical secondary structure (Poppelreuther et&#160;al, 2012), and the protein presumably moves to LDs via ER&#8211;LD contacts. We next asked whether seipin deficiency induces a general defect in the translocation of ER proteins to LDs. To address this, we employed HPos, a model peptide harboring the hydrophobic domain of ALDI for ER insertion and the LD&#8208;targeting sequence of caveolin&#8208;1 (Kassan et&#160;al, 2013). This peptide was shown to translocate from the ER to nascent LDs within minutes after fatty acid administration. Accordingly, we observed that HPos&#8208;Cherry was efficiently targeted to forming LDs in WT cells, very similar to ACSL3&#8208;Cherry (Fig&#160;EV5A). Interestingly, the recruitment of HPos&#8208;Cherry to nascent LDs was not prevented in SKO cells and the peptide could also reach LDs devoid of endogenous ACSL3 (Fig&#160;EV5A&#8211;C).</text>

      <text>We next examined the kinetics of HPos&#8208;Cherry ER&#8211;LD trafficking with fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments. We induced LD biogenesis by incubating cells with OA for 2&#160;h which resulted in the recruitment of HPos&#8208;Cherry to LDs in both WT and SKO cells. We then bleached the HPos&#8208;Cherry signal at LDs and monitored recovery to LDs. For FRAP analysis, we focused on LDs that were relatively immobile, to avoid detection inaccuracies resulting from fast LD movements. In WT cells, there was a clear recovery and re&#8208;accumulation of HPos&#8208;Cherry to LDs via the ER (Figs&#160;5A and B, and EV5D). However, in SKO cells the recovery of HPos was severely impaired (Figs&#160;5A and B, and EV5D). Yet, the mobility of this peptide in the ER was similar in both WT and SKO cells under normal growth conditions (Fig&#160;EV5E). It is thus plausible that the initial rapid recovery, similar in WT and SKO cells, reflects the fast recovery of the peptide in the ER, and the slower component, severely attenuated in SKO cells, the return of HPos to the LD monolayer. Together, these data suggest that the initial accumulation of HPos to forming LDs was preserved in SKO cells, but subsequent movement to pre&#8208;existing LDs was compromised.</text>

      <text>To examine the lipid transport capabilities of ER&#8211;LD junctions, we utilized Bodipy&#8208;C12 (BPY&#8208;C12), a fluorescent fatty acid analog used to monitor cellular fatty acid trafficking in cells (Rambold et&#160;al, 2015; Ohsaki et&#160;al, 2016). To this end, we first incubated delipidated cells in the presence of BPY&#8208;C12 for 24&#160;h, resulting in the incorporation of BPY&#8208;C12 into cellular lipids, mostly phosphatidylcholine and neutral lipids (Fig&#160;EV6A). We then incubated cells with OA for 1&#8211;2&#160;h to induce LD biogenesis, which was accompanied by the accumulation of BPY&#8208;lipids to LDs in both WT and SKO cells (Fig&#160;5C and D). However, FRAP experiments revealed that the return of BPY to LDs was impaired in SKO cells compared to WT (Figs&#160;5D and E, and EV6B) while recovery in ER membranes appeared similar between genotypes (Fig&#160;EV6C). Analogously to HPos, this suggests that BPY&#8208;lipids can be incorporated into nascent LDs but cannot reach pre&#8208;existing ones. To probe this further, we first induced LD biogenesis with OA for 1&#160;h and then labeled cells with BPY&#8208;C12 for 10&#160;min and chased for increasing times in the presence of OA. In WT cells, there was a gradual, clear increase in BPY LD localization and a subsequent decrease in BPY labeling of membranous structures (Fig&#160;5F and G). In contrast, in SKO cells the probe largely remained in a membranous pattern and the colocalization of BPY with LDs was markedly attenuated (Fig&#160;5F and G).</text>

      <text>To compare the rapid flux of non&#8208;fluorescent fatty acids to neutral lipids in WT and SKO cells, we employed &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry. Alkyne&#8208;OA has previously been used to monitor fatty acid flux in mammalian cells and shown to perform similarly as radiolabeled tracers (Thiele et&#160;al, 2012). We first examined neutral lipid synthesis of WT and SKO cells during early LD biogenesis, incubating delipidated cells with 0.1&#160;mM alkyne&#8208;OA for 10&#160;min and chasing for 20&#160;min. Both after the pulse and after the chase, alkyne&#8208;OA incorporation into neutral lipids was similar between genotypes (Fig&#160;5H), arguing that the neutral lipid synthesis machinery of SKO cells is intact during early steps of LD biogenesis. However, when the 10&#8208;min alkyne&#8208;OA pulse&#8208;chase was performed after a 1&#8208;h pre&#8208;incubation with unlabeled OA to first induce the generation of LDs, the results were different. Both after the pulse and after the chase, there was an impairment of OA incorporation into neutral lipids in SKO cells (Figs&#160;5H and EV6D and E).</text>

      <text>Overall, these data suggest that in SKO cells, initial protein and lipid trafficking to nascent LDs is at least partly preserved and neutral lipid synthesis during early LD assembly is intact. Instead, the subsequent trafficking of cargo between ER and more mature LDs is compromised and accompanied by a neutral lipid synthesis defect.</text>

      <text>To study the role of seipin on LDs after longer fatty acid exposure, we incubated cells with OA for 20&#160;h. Also under these conditions, seipin&#8208;GFP was found at ER&#8211;LD contacts, while A212P&#8208;seipin&#8208;GFP was more frequently absent (Fig&#160;6A and Appendix&#160;Fig S5A&#8211;C). By light and electron microscopy, WT cells were characterized by numerous, relatively homogeneous looking LDs, often in clusters (Fig&#160;6B&#8211;D). In contrast, SKO cells harbored strikingly heterogeneous LDs, with small aggregated as well as supersized LDs, as described (Szymanski et&#160;al, 2007; Fei et&#160;al, 2008). In addition, abundant small individual LDs were found throughout the cell (Fig&#160;6B&#8211;D). These small LDs behaved similarly as the newly formed LDs of SKO cells, displaying increased mobility and aberrant trajectories, with a subset moving seemingly independently of the ER (Fig&#160;6E and F, and Appendix&#160;Fig S5E&#8211;G). Instead, the aggregated and supersized LDs were typically immobile (Appendix&#160;Fig S5E and F). Also under these conditions, by SB&#8208;EM, LDs disconnected from the ER were only detected in SKO cells (Appendix&#160;Fig S5H).</text>

      <text>We next investigated the localization of endogenous ACSL3 in cells after 20&#160;h of OA loading. In WT cells, ACSL3 was invariably associated with LDs (Fig&#160;6G and H). In SKO cells, a substantial fraction of the small LDs did not acquire ACSL3, while the large LDs did (Fig&#160;6G and H). We also studied the localization of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2), the final enzyme of TG synthesis that has been shown to localize to LDs to promote their growth (Kuerschner et&#160;al, 2008; Wilfling et&#160;al, 2013). Indeed, many large LDs of WT and SKO cells recruited this protein, while most small LDs did not, with no obvious difference between genotypes (Appendix&#160;Fig S5I). To examine cargo transport at ER&#8211;LD junctions at this time point, we performed HPos FRAP experiments. In WT cells, HPos returned efficiently to all LDs analyzed, but in SKO cells, the majority of LDs&#160;showed impaired recovery (Fig&#160;6I and J, and Appendix&#160;Fig S6). Curiously, some large (&gt;&#160;0.5&#160;&#956;m in diameter) LDs in SKO cells showed exceptionally rapid HPos recovery (Fig&#160;6I and&#160;J).</text>

      <text>Overall, these data suggest that the connectivity of LDs to the ER is continuous over time in WT cells. In the absence of seipin, small &#8220;nascent&#8208;like&#8221; LDs with dysfunctional/missing ER contacts are continuously present. In parallel, large LDs of SKO cells display heterogeneous ER connectivity.</text>

      <text>To assess whether our findings in SKO A431 cells can be reproduced in BSCL2 patient&#8208;derived cells, we analyzed LD dynamics and ER&#8211;LD relationship in healthy control (control 1 and control 2) and BSCL2 patient&#8208;derived primary fibroblasts with homozygous frameshift mutations in seipin (S3 and S5) (Boutet et&#160;al, 2009). When delipidated fibroblasts were incubated for 1&#160;h with OA to induce LD biogenesis, the BSCL2 patient cells showed aberrant LD morphology, with an abundance of tiny LDs (Fig&#160;7A), in agreement with previous findings in fibroblasts from a BSCL2 patient with a different mutation (Szymanski et&#160;al, 2007) and our observations in A431 SKO cells. Aberrantly large LDs were also detected, especially after prolonged OA incubation (Appendix&#160;Fig S7A). Interestingly, live cell imaging revealed an almost twofold increase in the mobility of nascent LDs in the cell periphery of BSCL2 patient cells as compared to controls (Fig&#160;7B and C, and Movie EV9). High&#8208;resolution live cell imaging of LDs and the ER showed that, similarly to A431 SKO cells, in BSCL2 patient cells a subset of LDs were moving at high velocities and apparently independently of the ER (Fig&#160;7D and E, and Appendix&#160;Fig S7B and C, and Movie EV10). In contrast, in control cells even rapidly moving LDs appeared to move along the ER (Fig&#160;7D and E, and Movie EV10). Moreover, analysis of confocal z&#8208;stacks of fixed specimen showed that BSCL2 patient cells harbored LDs with no obvious contact with the ER, while this was not observed in control fibroblasts (Appendix&#160;Fig S7D). We also investigated the targeting of endogenous ACSL3 to LDs. In BSCL2 patient cells, ACSL3 localization was altered in a similar manner as observed in A431 SKO cells (Fig&#160;7F and G). Finally, in alkyne&#8208;OA flux experiments (analogous to the ones in A431 cells), we found no defect in OA incorporation into neutral lipids in delipidated cells. After LD biogenesis induction, control fibroblasts increased OA incorporation into neutral lipids, but BSCL2 cells failed to do so (Fig&#160;7H).</text>

      <text>In this study, we found that human seipin is present in discrete foci in the ER and these structures were enriched at ER&#8211;LD junctions by immuno&#8208;EM, similarly as reported for Ldb16 in yeast (Grippa et&#160;al, 2015). We estimated the size of these foci to be roughly 40&#8211;50&#160;nm by antibody detection of fluorescently tagged proteins. This size estimate is roughly in line with that obtained by atomic force microscopy of purified seipin oligomers (Sim et&#160;al, 2013). It is also possible that several oligomers join into a functional unit at the ER&#8211;LD junction.</text>

      <text>The seipin&#8208;GFP foci were mobile in the ER, with LD&#8208;associated puncta moving less rapidly than those not associated with LDs. Most nascent LDs harbored only one WT&#8208;seipin&#8208;GFP punctum that appeared to be stably associated with the LD and moving together with it. Importantly, similar stable association of seipin at ER&#8211;LD contacts and dynamic non&#8208;LD&#8208;associated seipin foci in the ER were observed when human seipin was tagged with GFP at its endogenous genomic locus. This agrees well with recent findings on endogenously tagged seipin in Drosophila cells (Wang et&#160;al, 2016). Seipin recruitment to ER&#8211;LD contacts is a relatively early event during LD biogenesis, as reintroduction of seipin did not rescue protein targeting to pre&#8208;existing LDs of seipin&#8208;deficient cells.</text>

      <text>Lipid droplets are considered to maintain a close functional and physical relationship with the ER (Jacquier et&#160;al, 2011; Wilfling et&#160;al, 2013), but proteins tethering LDs to the ER have not been characterized. In A431 cells used in this study, all newly formed LDs appeared to be physically linked to the ER via discrete membrane contacts, as judged by ET. Unexpectedly, in SKO cells, a subset (roughly 10%) of LDs was entirely devoid of membrane contacts to the ER. In addition, the persisting ER&#8211;LD contacts in SKO cells appeared morphologically abnormal, forming either very narrow and string&#8208;like or extensive web&#8208;like attachments. These data strongly suggest that seipin is critical for the formation and/or stabilization of normal ER&#8211;LD contacts. However, as some LDs in SKO cells appeared extensively surrounded by the ER, seipin is presumably not the only protein responsible for the maintenance of ER&#8211;LD contacts. Interestingly, LD detachment from the ER has not been reported in yeast lacking seipin (Fdl1&#916;/Ldb16&#916;). On the other hand, although we found a subset of LDs wrapped by the ER, we did not observe abnormal proliferations in the ER enwrapping LDs, as described in yeast (Grippa et&#160;al, 2015; Wolinski et&#160;al, 2015). This suggests cell type&#8208;specific differences in the phenotype(s) of ER&#8211;LD contacts in the absence of seipin. We did, however, observe a general widening of ER profiles in SKO cells that had been challenged with OA for 1&#160;h. We speculate that this might reflect the deposition of cargo destined to LDs inside the ER. Indeed, studies in Fdl1&#916; yeast have documented increased neutral lipid sequestration in the ER during LD biogenesis (Cartwright et&#160;al, 2015).</text>

      <text>Based on our studies of protein and lipid delivery from the ER to LDs, it seems that a large fraction, potentially all, of ER&#8211;LD contacts in seipin knockout cells were functionally defective. Another unanticipated observation, possibly reflecting the loss of functional ER contacts in seipin&#8208;deficient cells, was the increased mobility of LDs. This was most conspicuous for LDs that appeared not to maintain contacts with the ER, exhibiting rapid, non&#8208;directional jerky movements. Importantly, increased and abnormal LD motility in the cell periphery was also observed in BSCL2 patient fibroblasts. It is conceivable that ER contacts limit LD movement, and if lost, LD mobility becomes unrestricted. Interestingly, in seipin&#8208;deficient cells also those LDs that appeared to move along the ER often had higher velocities. This points to the possibility that seipin plays a role in immobilizing LDs at distinct sites in the ER. Moreover, the generation of abnormally numerous small LDs suggests that seipin may also act by somehow restricting the number of LD nucleation sites in the ER (Cartwright &amp; Goodman, 2012). To better understand this, it will be important to study the functions of non&#8208;LD&#8208;associated seipin foci.</text>

      <text>A marked phenotype of seipin&#8208;deficient cells upon fatty acid loading is the formation of numerous tiny LDs. By EM, these LDs had a rather uniform diameter of circa 200&#160;nm. This suggests that the initial formation of LDs in the ER does not depend on seipin, but in the absence of seipin, growth of most LDs beyond this size becomes abortive. A similar conclusion was reached by Wang et&#160;al (2016), while our work was under review. Based on our study, one possible explanation for this is the defective recruitment of protein machinery involved in lipid synthesis from the ER to LDs, as indicated by the impaired LD targeting of ACSL3 that should channel fatty acids into nascent LDs and promote their growth (Kassan et&#160;al, 2013). Moreover, the recruitment of some protein and lipid cargo to forming LDs was initially successful in seipin&#8208;deficient cells, as indicated by the targeting of BPY&#8208;C12 metabolites and the HPos model peptide to nascent LDs. Yet, based on FRAP studies their recruitment to pre&#8208;formed LDs was compromised. Our rapid fatty acid flux experiments strengthened the idea that the initial machinery for triglyceride synthesis in seipin&#8208;deficient cells is intact. However, a marked defect in OA incorporation into neutral lipids became manifested if OA was introduced into cells that already exhibited triglyceride stores and LDs. Together, these data imply that nascent LDs need to reach a distinct maturity at which the role of seipin in ER&#8211;LD cargo exchange becomes apparent.</text>

      <text>Lipid droplet biogenesis is considered to be a stepwise process, originating by initial aggregation of neutral lipids inside the ER bilayer (Pol et&#160;al, 2014). Such initial lenses have so far not been reported in mammalian cells, but are likely to be followed by bigger blister&#8208;like structures strengthening membrane curvature changes. The neutral lipid core would grow and induce the structure to bud off from the ER but remain in a dynamic contact with it. Indeed, LDs connected to the ER via what appear to be membrane bridges have been visualized by EM by us and others (Kassan et&#160;al, 2013; Wilfling et&#160;al, 2013). Based on our findings, the simplest interpretation is that seipin plays a role in LD biogenesis after the initial LD nucleation, by helping to physically bridge at least a subset of newly formed LDs to the ER (Fig&#160;8). By contributing structurally to or otherwise stabilizing the ER&#8211;LD contact, seipin may also facilitate the incorporation of protein and lipid cargo into growing LDs. This idea does not rule out other proposed functions of seipin at the ER&#8211;LD interphase, such as a scaffolding of proteins important for neutral lipid synthesis (Sim et&#160;al, 2013; Talukder et&#160;al, 2015).</text>

      <text>Schematic illustration of the proposed role of seipin in ER&#8211;LD contacts</text>

      <text> LD biogenesis is initiated in the ER. Nascent LDs harboring seipin at their ER contact recruit proteins and lipids from the ER to promote LD growth. LDs remain associated with&#160;the ER during maturation, allowing continuous cargo exchange between these compartments. In seipin&#8208;deficient cells, ER&#8211;LD contacts are morphologically abnormal, either missing, rudimentary, or aberrantly extensive. Most newly formed LDs lack functional contacts with the ER. HPos, a model ER&#8208;to&#8208;LD targeting peptide can initially reach&#160;LDs but its access to LDs is later perturbed. ACSL3, a lipid biosynthetic enzyme normally targeted to the LD surface remains in the ER or at ER&#8211;LD junctions. Oleic acid flux into neutral lipids is initially intact but subsequently impaired. In contrast, ADRP, a cytoplasmic coat protein, reaches LDs independently of seipin. Defective ER&#8211;LD contacts result in discontinued cargo exchange and arrested LD maturation, where the majority of LDs fail to grow beyond the diameter of ~200&#160;nm.</text>

      <text>Importantly, it is increasingly evident that the communication between ER and LDs is bidirectional. Proteins and lipids may also relocate from the LD to the ER (Jacquier et&#160;al, 2011; Kassan et&#160;al, 2013; Wilfling et&#160;al, 2013) and mature LDs may be accessible from the ER luminal side (Mishra et&#160;al, 2016). The proposal that seipin acts as a diffusion barrier between the two compartments is interesting in this regard (Grippa et&#160;al, 2015), and potentially compatible with our data. For instance, nascent LDs might need seipin as a diffusion barrier to control their surface phospholipid composition, which would be required for the proper targeting of proteins destined for growing LDs and for the maintenance of their ER contacts. Considering the persistent localization of seipin at ER&#8211;LD contacts, it is likely that it also plays a role in the maintenance of more mature LDs. However, at present it is not possible to discriminate between bona fide later role(s) of seipin from secondary effects induced at the earlier step(s) of LD biogenesis.</text>

      <text>In conclusion, this study reveals a role for seipin in ensuring functional ER&#8211;LD contacts of nascent LDs in human cells. How defective ER&#8211;LD interactions contribute to the near absence of adipose tissue in human BSCL2 remains open. An interesting observation in this context is that unilocular adipocytes may contain ER&#8208;associated micro&#8208;LDs that serve as intermediates in the packaging of triglycerides to the unilocular LD (Chu et&#160;al, 2014).</text>

      <text>Human epithelial carcinoma A431 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (100&#160;U/ml each) and L&#8208;glutamine (2&#160;mM). Transfections of plasmids (Lipofectamine LTX with PLUS Reagent) and siRNAs (HiPerfect) were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Control human primary fibroblasts were from Coriell Cell Repositories (GM01650 and GM00323, designated as controls 1 and 2 in this study), and BSCL2 patient fibroblasts S3 and S5 were established from forearm skin biopsies of patients described in Boutet et&#160;al (2009). Fibroblasts were cultured in MEM, with 15% non&#8208;heat&#8208;inactivated FBS supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and L&#8208;glutamine. Primary human fibroblasts were transfected with Amaxa Human Dermal Fibroblasts Nucleofector Kit (Lonza) according to the manufacturer's instructions.</text>

      <text>Superfolder&#8208;GFP (P&#233;delacq et&#160;al, 2006) and a 3XGGGGS linker were inserted at the C&#8208;terminus of endogenous seipin by CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated genome editing (Pinder et&#160;al, 2015). Briefly, a homology&#8208;directed repair template was generated by overlap PCR and transfected into A431 cells together with a vector encoding Cas9, sgRNA targeting the C&#8208;terminus of seipin locus, and a puromycin selection marker. Clones were isolated after transient selection with puromycin. See Appendix&#160;Fig S4 for details of the constructs.</text>

      <text>Cells were delipidated by culturing in serum&#8208;free medium supplemented with 5% lipoprotein&#8208;deficient serum [LPDS; prepared as described in Goldstein et&#160;al (1983)] for 3&#160;days. For experiments involving LD induction, unless otherwise stated, cells were supplemented with 0.2&#160;mM OA [final concentration, OA supplemented in complex with BSA in 8:1 molar ratio prepared in serum&#8208;free DMEM as described in H&#246;ltt&#228;&#8208;Vuori et&#160;al (2013)] for indicated times. For cell fusion, cells were first co&#8208;plated for 2.5&#160;h. Fusion was induced by adding PEG 1500 (50% w/v) to the cells for 1&#160;min at RT, followed by four washes with PBS.</text>

      <text>Alkyne&#8208;OA click assay was performed essentially as described in Thiele et&#160;al (2012). Briefly, for A431 cells 1&#160;h prior to alkyne&#8208;OA labeling delipidated cells grown in 6&#8208;cm dishes were transferred to CO2&#8208;independent medium containing 5% LPDS only or 5% LPDS and 0.1&#160;mM OA and transferred to 37&#176;C water bath. Cells were then pulsed for 10&#160;min with 0.1&#160;mM alkyne&#8208;OA in 10&#160;mg/ml fatty acid&#8208;free BSA medium and collected, or further incubated in chase medium (10% FBS or 0.1&#160;mM OA) for 20&#160;min. For fibroblasts, pulse and chase times were doubled to account for slower alkyne&#8208;OA uptake and metabolism, chase medium contained 0.1&#160;mM OA, and incubations were performed at 37&#176;C, 5% CO2. Lipids were then extracted and the extracts reacted with 3&#8208;azido&#8208;7&#8208;hydroxycoumarin in the presence of Cu(I) as in Thiele et&#160;al (2012). After the click reaction, products were separated on standard silica gel TLC plates and the plates developed and imaged as described in Thiele et&#160;al (2012). Densitometric analysis of the fraction of alkyne&#8208;OA incorporated into cellular lipids was analyzed from images as percentage of total lane intensity with ImageJ FIJI.</text>
