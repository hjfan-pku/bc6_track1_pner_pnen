      <text>Despite being one of the most studied proteases in bacteria, very little is known about the role of ClpXP in mitochondria. We now present evidence that mammalian CLPP has an essential role in determining the rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis by regulating the level of mitoribosome assembly. Through a proteomic approach and the use of a catalytically inactive CLPP, we produced the first comprehensive list of possible mammalian ClpXP substrates involved in the regulation of mitochondrial translation, oxidative phosphorylation, and a number of metabolic pathways. We further show that the defect in mitoribosomal assembly is a consequence of the accumulation of ERAL1, a putative 12S rRNA chaperone, and novel ClpXP substrate. The presented data suggest that the timely removal of ERAL1 from the small ribosomal subunit is essential for the efficient maturation of the mitoribosome and a normal rate of mitochondrial translation.</text>

      <text>Proteases have an essential role in safeguarding cell survival by maintaining protein homeostasis, which is threatened by different internal and external insults. They also perform another, equally important role in cellular physiology, namely regulated proteolysis that ensures constant turnover of house&#8208;keeping proteins as well as the elimination of specific proteins when they are no longer needed. The irreversible nature of this process demands rigorous selectivity in the choice of substrates and the degradation timing. In prokaryotes, regulated protein degradation is governed by energy&#8208;dependent proteases, of which ClpXP is probably the best studied as it contributes to a large fraction of protein turnover in bacteria (Sauer &amp; Baker, 2011). ClpXP is a highly conserved proteasome&#8208;like machinery present in all bacterial species and is also found in the mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotic cells (Sauer &amp; Baker, 2011). In mammals, ClpXP protein substrates are recognized and unfolded by the hexameric AAA+ protein CLPX that delivers them to the CLPP protease for degradation (Sauer &amp; Baker, 2011). The CLPP protease is formed by one or two heptameric rings and on its own can degrade small peptides but has no significant activity against proteins (Sauer &amp; Baker, 2011). CLPX appears to be the only unfoldase present in mammalian mitochondria that interacts with the CLPP protease (Kang et&#160;al, 2002). Some eukaryotes, like Saccharomyces cerevisiae, lack CLPP but still possess the CLPX unfoldase that has specific roles, independent of the protease activity, like a recently shown function in the regulation of heme synthesis (Kardon et&#160;al, 2015).</text>

      <text>ClpXP is important for the viability and growth, cell cycle progression, recovery from environmental insults, and sporulation in many bacterial species (Damerau &amp; St John, 1993; Jenal &amp; Fuchs, 1998). Much less is known about the role of mitochondrial ClpXP, and we just begin to understand the different aspects of its impact on mitochondrial physiology. In humans, CLPP deficiency causes Perrault syndrome characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and a premature ovarian failure (Jenkinson et&#160;al, 2013). Recently, it was shown that CLPP&#8208;deficient mice faithfully replicate major physiological aspects of the human disease (Gispert et&#160;al, 2013). Remarkably, deletion of mitochondrial Clpp leads to improved health and increased life span in the filamentous fungus, Podospora anserina (Fischer et&#160;al, 2013).</text>

      <text>The present study aimed to analyze the role of CLPP in mammalian mitochondria by creating Clpp knockout mice. Depletion of CLPP leads to the development of moderate respiratory deficiency caused by ineffective mitochondrial protein synthesis, due to decreased amounts of fully assembled mitochondrial ribosomes (55S, mitoribosomes). We show that in the absence of CLPP, ERAL1, a putative 12S rRNA chaperone, strongly associates with the small ribosomal subunit (28S), therefore preventing formation of functional mitoribosomes.</text>

      <text>To determine the in&#160;vivo function of CLPP in mammals, we generated a conditional knockout allele of the mouse Clpp gene (Fig&#160;1A and B). CLPP&#8208;deficient mice (Clpp&#8722;/&#8722;) were obtained from intercrossing of Clpp+/&#8722; animals (Fig&#160;1C), and the loss of CLPP was confirmed on both transcript and protein level (Fig&#160;1D and E). Although we regularly acquired Clpp&#8722;/&#8722; mice, they were not born in Mendelian ratios (Table&#160;EV1), likely dying in utero, since no postnatal lethality prior to the age of weaning was observed. Currently, we follow an aging cohort of CLPP&#8208;deficient mice that show the same survival as respective wild&#8208;type littermates at least up to 2&#160;years of age. This is in contrast to findings on a similar mouse model reported to have increased postnatal mortality and possibly shorter life span, although we also observed general sterility of both CLPP&#8208;deficient genders and shorter stature of the mice, as describe earlier (Gispert et&#160;al, 2013). Besides differences in the genetic approach used to generate CLPP&#8208;deficient mice (conditional knockout targeting versus gene&#8208;trap technology), also different hygienic level in animal facilities might contribute to these disparities. Overall, our results suggest that CLPP function is essential in some critical period during development and that in the postnatal life mice can tolerate a CLPP deficiency.</text>

      <text>To understand the role of CLPP in the organelle physiology, we analyzed the global protein changes in the presence and absence of CLPP. Proteomes of sucrose&#8208;cushion&#8208;purified heart mitochondria were analyzed by liquid chromatography&#8211;tandem mass spectrometry (LC&#8208;MS/MS). With this approach, we were able to identify 736 proteins, of which 595 (81%) were mitochondrial (Table&#160;EV2), with high reproducibility as determined by Pearson correlation coefficient for biological replicates R&#160;&gt;&#160;0.97 (Fig&#160;EV1A). In addition, we detected similar numbers of significantly upregulated and downregulated proteins (51 and 62, respectively, at a FDR&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05) upon CLPP depletion (Table&#160;EV2).</text>

      <text>GO term analysis (Eden et&#160;al, 2009) was used to obtain a more systematic evaluation of specific changes in our dataset related to CLPP deficiency (Fig&#160;2B). Proteins that are annotated as mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC), in particular complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.5.3) subunits, showed a clear downregulation in CLPP&#8208;deficient mitochondria (Fig&#160;2A and B, and Table&#160;EV2). In contrast, mitochondrial translation machinery was highly upregulated, as the levels of multiple mitoribosome subunits (mainly part of 28S) and proteins involved in translation initiation, elongation, and ribosome recycling were increased (Fig&#160;2A and Table&#160;EV2). Taken together, these results demonstrate that loss of CLPP causes downregulation of RC subunits and alteration in mitochondrial gene expression, indicating respiratory chain deficiency.</text>

      <text>Thus, we next measured RC enzyme activities in CLPP&#8208;deficient heart mitochondria (Fig&#160;2C). An isolated complex I (C I) deficiency was detected at 15&#160;weeks of age and was followed by complex IV deficiency (C IV) at 35&#160;weeks (Fig&#160;2C). Additional experiments allowed us to further characterize the nature of the RC deficiency in Clpp knockout mice. We measured the oxidation of complex I or complex I&#160;+&#160;II substrates in freshly isolated heart mitochondria and found a general reduction in all inducible respiratory states resulting from the loss of CLPP (Fig&#160;2D). The decrease in the RC complex activities was accompanied by a significant reduction in the steady&#8208;state levels of RC subunits encoded either by mitochondrial or nuclear DNA (Fig&#160;2E). Likewise, a clear reduction in the&#160;level of assembled complexes I and IV was observed in CLPP&#8208;deficient heart and skeletal muscle mitochondria, while liver mitochondria showed a milder decrease in both RC complexes (Fig&#160;EV1B). Reduction in complex I and IV levels in heart and skeletal muscle mitochondria was mirrored by a reduction in the level of supercomplexes (Fig&#160;2F) and a decrease in in&#8208;gel activity (Fig&#160;EV1C and D). An additional sign of existing respiratory chain dysfunction was the presence of a subcomplex of complex V (Fig&#160;EV1B) that is likely the F1 part of the ATP synthase and was found in other models defective in mitochondrial gene expression like Mterf3 (Park et&#160;al, 2007), Mterf4 (Camara et&#160;al, 2011), and Dars2 knockout mice (Dogan et&#160;al, 2014).</text>

      <text>The respiratory dysfunction in Clpp knockout mice prompted us to inspect mtDNA levels and mitochondrial expression patterns. Southern blot analysis showed no increase in the level of mtDNA in Clpp knockout hearts (Fig&#160;3A), in contrast to a previous report on a similar model (Gispert et&#160;al, 2013). The difference might stem from methods applied to examine mtDNA levels (Southern blot analysis versus RT&#8211;PCR) or from the genetic approach used to generate CLPP&#8208;deficient mice (conditional knockout targeting versus gene&#8208;trap technology) (Gispert et&#160;al, 2013). Remarkably, this study also reports that the marked rise in the amount of mtDNA is not accompanied by an increase in steady&#8208;state levels of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) (Gispert et&#160;al, 2013), a protein that packages mtDNA and is absolutely necessary for mtDNA maintenance (Freyer et&#160;al, 2010), making this result hard to interpret.</text>

      <text>We next examined the levels of mitochondrial RNAs and detected a substantial increase in most (Fig&#160;3B and C). Matching the increase in steady&#8208;state levels of mitochondrial transcripts, we found higher levels of LRPPRC, an RNA binding protein essential for the stability and polyadenylation of mitochondrial mRNAs (Fig&#160;3D) (Ruzzenente et&#160;al, 2012). Remarkably, a twofold increase in 12S rRNA was observed, while the levels of 16S rRNA were not significantly different (Fig&#160;3B). De novo transcription rates in CLPP&#8208;deficient mitochondria were also increased, matching the observed higher levels of mtRNA species (Fig&#160;3E). An enhanced transcription is often detected in mouse models with defects in mitochondrial protein synthesis, as a likely compensatory mechanism for respiratory chain deficiency (Camara et&#160;al, 2011; Dogan et&#160;al, 2014).</text>

      <text>To assess mitochondrial translation, we measured the rate of de novo protein synthesis in CLPP&#8208;deficient heart mitochondria and detected a general decrease in mitochondrial translation rates (Fig&#160;4A). The absence of a major protease might prevent the generation of peptides and possibly decreases the pool of free amino acids in the mitochondrial matrix. However, the analysis of different tRNAs showed that aminoacylation levels of mt&#8208;tRNAs is not diminished by CLPP deficiency and might be even increased, corresponding to higher steady&#8208;state levels of mt&#8208;tRNAs (Fig&#160;EV2A).</text>

      <text>To further understand the defect in mitochondrial protein synthesis caused by the loss of CLPP, we treated immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with antibiotics that block mitochondrial translation at different steps. Clpp knockout MEFs recapitulated a decrease in the steady&#8208;state level of individual OXPHOS subunits observed in CLPP&#8208;deficient hearts (Fig&#160;EV2B). We monitored the level of mtDNA&#8208;encoded COXI/MT&#8208;CO1 subunit upon 48&#160;h incubation in the presence of the antibiotic, followed by a recovery period of additional 2&#160;days. Treatment of MEFs with actinonin, a peptidomimetic antibiotic, which inhibits peptide deformylase that catalyzes the removal of the formyl group from the&#160;starter methionine (Richter et&#160;al, 2013), demonstrated that Clpp knockout cells have a lower recovery of COXI levels, in agreement with defective mitochondrial synthesis and possibly diminished translation initiation (Fig&#160;4B and C). Doxycycline and chloramphenicol are known inhibitors of mitochondrial translation elongation, occupying the ribosomal A&#8208;site, the former binding to the small (28S), and the latter to the large (39S) ribosomal subunit (LaPolla &amp; Lambowitz, 1977; Kearsey &amp; Craig, 1981). Chloramphenicol had an identical effect on both cell lines, resulting in an almost full recovery of the COXI levels (Fig&#160;4B and C). In contrast, doxycycline&#8208;treated Clpp knockout cells were not able to recover COXI levels, even though this antibiotic had an overall milder effect on wild&#8208;type MEFs (Fig&#160;4B and C). This result suggests that loss of CLPP specifically affects the function of the 28S small ribosome.</text>

      <text>To assess the state of mitoribosome assembly, we performed sucrose gradient sedimentation analyses of mitochondrial extracts. Following the distribution of MRPS35, we observed high accumulation of the 28S small ribosome in Clpp knockout mitochondria, while levels of fully assembled mitoribosomes (55S) were diminished (Fig&#160;4D). The distribution of MRPL12, a subunit of the 39S large ribosome, further confirmed these results (Fig&#160;4D). In agreement with previous results, we detected a high accumulation of 12S rRNA in the 28S fraction, while the distribution of 16S rRNA was less affected by CLPP deficiency (Fig&#160;4D and EV2C). Both 12S and 16S rRNAs showed decreased association with the fully assembled mitoribosome, matching the decrease observed on the protein level (Fig&#160;4D and E). Different mt&#8208;mRNAs presented an abnormal pattern of distribution resulting in a smaller proportion of mt&#8208;mRNAs bound to the mitoribosome (Figs&#160;4D and E, and EV2C). Correspondingly, the steady&#8208;state levels of individual 28S ribosomal proteins were highly increased, while the subunits of 39S ribosome showed milder changes (Fig&#160;EV2D). The upregulation was likely the result of increased stability, rather than synthesis, as transcript levels of these ribosomal subunits were normal (Fig&#160;EV2E).</text>

      <text>To identify mammalian ClpXP substrates, we took advantage of the ability of inactivated CLPP to accept and retain proteins translocated into its chamber. We constructed a FLAG&#8208;tagged variant of murine CLPP in which the conserved Ser&#8208;149 residue of the consensus active site is replaced with alanine (S149A) (Fig&#160;EV3A). The homologous active&#8208;site mutation in Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Caulobacter crescentus was previously successfully used as a CLPP&#8208;substrate trap (Flynn et&#160;al, 2003; Bhat et&#160;al, 2013; Feng et&#160;al, 2013). Immortalized Clpp knockout MEFs were transfected with either empty plasmid or plasmids carrying genes encoding wild&#8208;type (CLPPWT&#8208;FLAG) or the mutant variant (CLPPS149A&#8208;FLAG) of CLPP (Fig&#160;EV3A). The ability of FLAG&#8208;tagged CLPP to form a functional chamber was confirmed on BN&#8208;PAGE, and we show that CLPPS149A produced stable tetradecamers and steadily interacted with CLPX likely due to a failure to release substrates (Fig&#160;EV3B). After isolation of mitochondria and subsequent co&#8208;immunoprecipitation with anti&#8208;FLAG antibodies, CLPP&#8208;bound proteins were analyzed by LC&#8208;MS/MS. The list of 66 possible substrates and interactors of ClpXP contains proteins highly enriched in CLPPS149A compared to CLPP&#8722;/&#8722; and CLPPWT fractions (Table&#160;EV3). In order to decipher the interactome obtained by our LC&#8208;MS/MS analysis, we used the string webtool (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10982861) (Fig&#160;5A). Here, we observed a strong association of several potential CLPP substrates and we found 15 proteins which have bacterial orthologues known to be ClpXP substrates (Table&#160;EV3) indicating that our approach is suitable for detection of potential substrates. The STRING analysis revealed a network of proteins involved in mitochondrial translation, but not replication or transcription, in agreement with our results. We also identified MRC protein subunits and enzymes involved in multiple metabolic processes in mitochondria (Table&#160;EV3).</text>

      <text>We then proceeded to further analyze selected candidates with a role in mitochondrial translation (EFG1, ERAL1, and P32/C1QBP) and also tested proteins involved in post&#8208;transcriptional processing of mtRNAs (MRPP1 and PNPT1). As expected from protease substrates, the steady&#8208;state levels of EFG1, one of mitochondrial translation elongation factors that catalyzes the movement of mRNA and tRNA within the 28S subunit (Sharma et&#160;al, 2003) and ERAL1, a 12S rRNA chaperone needed for the formation of functional small ribosomal subunits (Dennerlein et&#160;al, 2010; Uchiumi et&#160;al, 2010), were highly upregulated in Clpp knockout heart mitochondria and MEFs (Fig&#160;5B and EV3C). The upregulation is a result of increased stability and no changes in transcript levels (Fig&#160;5C). Conversely, we did not observe a change in the steady&#8208;state transcript or protein level of P32/C1QBP, proposed to be an essential RNA&#8208;binding factor in mitochondrial translation (Yagi et&#160;al, 2012), in cardiomyocytes or MEFs, suggesting that this protein might be an interactor of the ClpXP protease (Fig&#160;EV3C&#8211;E), in agreement with a previous report (Lowth et&#160;al, 2012).</text>

      <text>Further evidence that EFG1 and ERAL1 are likely ClpXP substrates came from the analysis in which we have blocked cytoplasmic protein synthesis by cycloheximide treatment and followed the turnover of these proteins. While in wild&#8208;type cells levels of both EFG1 and ERAL1 decreased over time, they were clearly stabilized in Clpp knockout MEFs (Fig&#160;5D). Correspondingly, a knockdown of Clpx unfoldase, the interacting partner of CLPP, in wild&#8208;type MEFs also caused an increase in EFG1 and ERAL1 levels (Fig&#160;5E). The same treatment of CLPP&#8208;deficient cells caused no additional effect on the levels of these two proteins, confirming that the observed phenotype is a result of general ClpXP deficiency (Fig&#160;5E).</text>

Nevertheless, no upregulation was detected in CLPP&#8208;deficient MEFs and we could not observe a clear difference in the turnover rate of these proteins upon cycloheximide chases, owing to their high stability even in wild&#8208;type mitochondria (Fig&#160;EV3E). Together, these data leave the open question if these proteins are indeed the substrates of ClpXP protease.</text>

      <text>As we have detected a strong defect in complex I activity and levels, we also analyzed NDUFV2 and NDUFS2, two highly scored C&#160;I subunits from our screen as potential CLPP substrates (Table&#160;EV3). Our results demonstrate that both, NDUFV2 and NDUFS2, are not stable in the absence of CLPP (Fig&#160;EV4A). In contrast, the C II subunit SDHA is highly stable under the same condition of CLPP deficiency (Fig&#160;EV4A). Thus, it is likely a ClpXP substrate (Fig&#160;5A), as others and we have suggested (Cole et&#160;al, 2015; Seiferling et&#160;al, 2016). Transcripts of both C I subunits are present in normal quantities (Fig&#160;EV4B), while steady&#8208;state protein levels are either normal (NDUFV2) or even downregulated (NDUFS2) in CLPP&#8208;deficient cardiomyocytes (Fig&#160;EV4C). Taken together, these results suggest that NDUFV2 and NDUFS2 are likely not substrates of CLPP, and hence, we have not investigated them further.</text>

      <text>To unravel how increased levels of EFG1 and ERAL1 could affect the formation of the mitoribosome, we performed gradient sedimentation analyses of mitochondrial ribosomes. To this end, we used shorter gradients that have a lower separation power, but allowed us to collect more material needed for subsequent studies. We confirmed our previous results, showing accumulation of 12S rRNA in the 28S small ribosomal subunit fraction, but decreased levels of fully assembled mitoribosomes (Fig&#160;6A). Similarly, we detected a massive increase (fivefold) in the level of unassembled (&#8220;free&#8221;) 39S ribosome subunits (MRPL12) in the absence of CLPP, accompanied by a milder rise in the level of unassembled 28S ribosome subunits (MRPS35) (Fig&#160;6A and EV5A).</text>

      <text>Next we investigated the migration of EFG1 and ERAL1 with the small (28S) and large (39S) ribosomal subunit or complete mitoribosomes (55S). Both of these proteins primarily interact with the 28S small ribosomal subunit (Coenen et&#160;al, 2004; Dennerlein et&#160;al, 2010). In wild&#8208;type mitochondria, EFG1 loosely associates with 28S ribosome and we detected it mainly as a free protein (Fig&#160;6B and D). In the absence of CLPP, EFG1 is present in higher levels in the mitochondria, but the association with the small ribosomal subunit is only mildly increased, suggesting that ClpXP is likely involved in turnover of this protein in its free form (Fig&#160;6B&#8211;D).</text>

      <text>In the absence of CLPP, ERAL1 association with the 28S ribosomal subunit was highly increased and spans over many fractions, suggesting that ERAL1 is not sufficiently removed from the 28S subunit and might still be present in the complete mitoribosome (Fig&#160;6B and C). This is even more obvious on long gradients, where we have corrected for the amount of the protein present in the sample (input) (Fig&#160;6D). Pretreatment of mitochondrial lysates with RNase that disrupts formation of mitoribosomes also leads to the loss of ERAL1 in the high molecular&#8208;mass fractions, suggesting that it indeed binds the ribosomal subunits (Fig&#160;EV5B). Collectively, these data suggest that this abnormal association of ERAL1 where approximately 20% of the protein present in the mitochondria is bound to multiple ribosomal fractions, likely has a major effect on mitoribosomal function and might be the main cause for the mitochondrial translation defect.</text>

      <text>We also detected lower levels of MRPS28 associated with the 28S ribosomal subunit (Fig&#160;6B). MRPS28 is predicted to be a functional and structural homolog of bacterial bS1 (Amunts et&#160;al, 2015) that shares the same binding site as Era, a bacterial homolog of ERAL1, on the bacterial 30S small ribosomal subunit. bS1 cannot be recruited to finish the maturation of the 30S subunit before Era is removed (Sharma et&#160;al, 2005). Our results demonstrate that MRPS28 is less recruited to the 28S ribosome in the CLPP&#8208;deficient mitochondria, likely because ERAL1 is still strongly bound to it (Fig&#160;6B). Furthermore, we provide first evidence that MRPS28 behaves more as a maturation factor, rather than a structural component of the 28S ribosome, as shown for its bacterial homolog (Komarova et&#160;al, 2002; Sharma et&#160;al, 2005).</text>

      <text>The binding of CLPX to the 28S ribosome was also increased in the absence of CLPP protease, possibly through interactions with its substrate ERAL1 (Fig&#160;6B&#8211;D). However, this interaction seems to be transient as it varies in different isolation conditions, for example, in ribosomal gradients from isolated heart mitochondria CLPX seems to bind more to the ribosomal fractions (Fig&#160;6B&#8211;D), while in gradients from whole cell lysates, we did not observe this interaction (Fig&#160;EV5C). Knockdown of Clpx failed to normalize the levels of 28S and 55S ribosomes or decrease the high association of ERAL1 with different ribosomal intermediates (Fig&#160;EV5C). More importantly, knockdown of Clpx did not have an impact on the levels of OXPHOS subunits in CLPP&#8208;deficient cells (Fig&#160;EV5D).</text>

      <text>As the primary defect observed in CLPP&#8208;deficient mitochondria seems to be in the maturation of 28S ribosomal subunits, we have turned our attention to ERAL1. First, we wanted to establish whether ERAL1 interacts with the ClpXP protease. To this end, we performed co&#8208;immunoprecipitation experiments with antibodies raised against endogenous ERAL1 (Fig&#160;7A). Our results show that, although ERAL1 interacts poorly with either CLPX or CLPP in wild&#8208;type cells, the interaction with CLPX is increased in the absence of the protease subunit (Fig&#160;7A). This was confirmed in the reciprocal experiment where we have precipitated much higher levels of ERAL1 with an antibody raised against CLPX in the Clpp knockout background (Fig&#160;7A). These data verify the direct interaction of the proteins within mitochondria and suggest that in wild&#8208;type cells this interaction is transient, while in the absence of CLPP, ERAL1 stays more permanently bound to CLPX. Remarkably, ectopic expression of ERAL1 in wild&#8208;type cells did not result in increased binding to mitochondrial ribosomal subunits, likely due to intact ClpXP activity that prevented increased and/or more permanent binding that might be disadvantageous (Fig&#160;EV6A). Consistently, further overexpression of ERAL1 in CLPP&#8208;deficient cells proved to be deleterious for cell growth and/or survival.</text>

      <text>If ERAL1 upregulation due to the absence of CLPP leads to development of the observed phenotypes, then normalization of ERAL1 levels should, at least in part, rescue the observed phenotypes. To test this, we have moderately downregulated ERAL1 levels in CLPP&#8208;deficient mitochondria to match the amount present in wild&#8208;type cells (Fig&#160;EV6B and C). Regulation of ERAL1 levels resulted in a decrease in the amount of 28S subunit in CLPP&#8208;deficient mitochondria and a weaker binding of ERAL1 to the higher fractions (Fig&#160;7B). Normalization of ERAL1 levels in CLPP&#8208;deficient MEFs also salvaged previously observed translation defect (Fig&#160;7C), resulting in a partial rescue of the steady&#8208;state levels of complex I and IV subunits (Fig&#160;7D and EV6B). The increase in the amount of individual subunits resulted in higher level of assembled complex I, but did not affect the level of complex III (Fig&#160;EV6D). In contrast, ERAL1 knockdown in wild&#8208;type cells led to a decrease in the levels of the same RC subunits (Fig&#160;7D and EV6B), in agreement with previous results showing that ERAL1 is needed for mitochondrial protein synthesis (Uchiumi et&#160;al, 2010).</text>

      <text>We proceeded to test whether normalization of ERAL1 levels in CLPP&#8208;deficient cells can rescue the observed defect in the recovery from doxycycline treatment. We monitored the recovery of mtDNA&#8208;encoded COXI subunit and nDNA&#8208;encoded NDUFB6 upon 48&#160;h of doxycycline treatment followed by 24&#160;h recovery (Fig&#160;7E and F). In line with previous results, we detected higher survival of cells and the recovery of COXI was increased in CLPP&#8208;deficient cells (Fig&#160;7F). As shown for other nDNA&#8208;encoded RC subunits (Fig&#160;7D and EV6B), NDUFB6 levels were also increased by the ERAL1 knockdown, although the recovery was not affected by the treatment (Fig&#160;7F). This result suggests that ERAL1 knockdown in CLPP&#8208;deficient cells rescues the nDNA&#8208;encoded subunits by increasing the amount of available mtDNA&#8208;encoded polypeptides needed for the assembly of&#160;functional RC complexes, therefore decreasing the turnover of unassembled subunits. The interdependence of nDNA&#8208;encoded RC subunits on functional mitochondrial protein synthesis is well established in multiple models and across different phyla (Park et&#160;al, 2007; Kwasniak et&#160;al, 2013; Dogan et&#160;al, 2014). In wild&#8208;type cells, knockdown of ERAL1 led to a significant decrease in the recovery of COXI levels (Fig&#160;7F).</text>

      <text>Remarkably, overexpression of wild&#8208;type CLPP reduced the levels of ERAL1, bound to the 28S ribosome, and restored the mitoribosomes (55S) (Fig&#160;EV6E). In contrast, ectopic expression of catalytically inactive CLPP (CLPPS149A) reduced the overall levels of ribosomal subunits, without restoring the mitoribosome assembly (Fig&#160;EV6E). Moreover, catalytically inactive CLPP protein strongly binds multiple ribosomal fractions and in its presence CLPX behaves in the same way, suggesting an active role for ClpXP on the mitochondrial ribosomes. These data also strengthen the role of ClpXP in the turnover of ERAL1 during ribosomal assembly.</text>

      <text>Our results demonstrate that the CLPP protease has an unforeseen role in the regulation of ribosomal biogenesis and mitochondrial translation. Mitochondrial translation is impaired in Clpp knockout mitochondria because the two ribosomal subunits are not assembled into a functional 55S mitoribosome. Consequently, respiratory chain dysfunction seems to be the major effect of CLPP deficiency in mammalian mitochondria, with complex I downregulation as a foremost consequence.</text>

      <text>The respiratory deficiency caused by CLPP depletion is moderate, and Clpp knockout mice represent a faithful model of Perrault syndrome caused by CLPP deficiency in humans, primarily characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and a premature ovarian failure (Gispert et&#160;al, 2013; Jenkinson et&#160;al, 2013). A spectrum of additional clinical features, including cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and muscle atrophy, has been described in some affected individuals (Jenkinson et&#160;al, 2012; Morino et&#160;al, 2014). Here we provide the first evidence that loss of CLPP leads to a defect in mitochondrial translation that may be the primary cause of the disease. In agreement, mutations in HARS2 (Pierce et&#160;al, 2011), LARS2 (Pierce et&#160;al, 2013), and TWINKLE (Morino et&#160;al, 2014), three out of four other genes causing Perrault syndrome also have a direct effect on mitochondrial protein synthesis.</text>

      <text>Our study identified many potential CLPP substrates involved in various pathways including mitochondrial translation and transcript processing, respiratory chain function, and multiple metabolic pathways. Some of the identified and partially characterized candidate proteins, like EFG1 and PNPT1, have been already detected as CLPP substrates in other organisms (Zybailov et&#160;al, 2009; Bhat et&#160;al, 2013; Feng et&#160;al, 2013). Remarkably, a recent study, using a BioID&#8208;mass spectrometry method to identify ClpP&#8208;interacting partners, provides a list of 49 possible ClpXP substrates and adaptors in human cells (Cole et&#160;al, 2015). The list of candidates, however, only partially overlaps with the one created by us and contains only nine identical hits, most of them involved in either TCA cycle or fatty acid metabolism (Cole et&#160;al, 2015). In addition, the list included a number of proteins involved in mtDNA maintenance (TFAM, MTSS1, POLG2), but not in mitochondrial translation (Cole et&#160;al, 2015). The obvious discrepancies between these two studies could be attributed to differences in the experimental approach, as the previous study selected proteins that equally interact with wild&#8208;type and mutant CLPP, thus excluding many of the CLPP substrates, as they would be instantly degraded in the wild&#8208;type background. Further differences could be explained by the cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific interactions (HEK293 T&#8208;Rex cells were used) and by the fact that cells were treated with tetracycline/doxycycline that has a profound effect on mitochondrial function, specifically on the maturation of 28S ribosomal subunit (LaPolla &amp; Lambowitz, 1977; Moullan et&#160;al, 2015), and we showed here that this is especially detrimental in the Clpp knockout background.</text>

      <text>Our results strongly suggest that the role for CLPP in ribosomal biogenesis could be explained by its regulation of ERAL1 levels. We believe that the upregulation of other proteins involved in mitochondrial translation, like translation elongation factor EFG1 or mitochondrial tRNA synthetases (VARS2 and IARS2) do not contribute significantly to the translation defect. Further support for this comes from a study in A.&#160;thaliana CLPP&#8208;deficient chloroplasts showing that over&#8208;accumulation of both translation elongation factors and aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases does not result in a significant loss of translation (Zybailov et&#160;al, 2009).</text>

      <text>We show that accumulation of ERAL1 results in much higher binding to the small ribosomal subunit that prevents full maturation and assembly of 28S and 39S subunits into a functional mitoribosome. This is reminiscent of the situation in prokaryotes where binding of Era to the 30S small ribosomal subunit results in a conformation change that is less favorable for association with the 50S large subunit (Sharma et&#160;al, 2005). Furthermore, in an in&#160;vitro assay, 2.5&#8208;fold increase in the amount of Era leads to a 50% decreased formation of mature bacterial ribosomes, while a fivefold increase, almost completely prevents it (Sharma et&#160;al, 2005). Our results argue that the strong binding of ERAL1 also prevents binding of other translation initiation and elongation factors that are not substrates of ClpXP protease. It is currently not known how ERAL1 is extracted from the 28S subunit during the last steps of small subunit maturation, and our results propose that ClpXP might play an active role in this process. This is supported by our data showing that not only ERAL1 levels were increased, but also the ratio of ribosome&#8208;bound to free ERAL1 is much higher in Clpp knockout mitochondria, while MRPS28 association with the 28S ribosome is diminished. This goes hand in hand with the observation that CLPX is also much more present on the small ribosomal subunit and possibly bound to ERAL1 in the CLPP&#8208;deficient mitochondria, likely because protease activity and/or conformation changes mediated by ClpXP are needed to release this interaction. Interestingly, strong downregulation of ERAL1 levels also has detrimental effects on cell survival and mitoribosome assembly, even though two published studies do not agree on which effect is more pronounced (Dennerlein et&#160;al, 2010; Uchiumi et&#160;al, 2010). Taken together, these data suggest that ERAL1 is essential for the 28S ribosome assembly, but needs to be timely removed to allow translation initiation to proceed and 28S to interact with 39S to form functional mitoribosome. Therefore, both increased and decreased levels of ERAL1 would be unfavorable for the assembly of the mitoribosome and the mitochondrial translation rate. It is possible to envision that the changes of ClpXP levels under stress condition might provide a way to rapidly downregulate mitochondrial translation, by regulating ERAL1 and hence 28S levels, thus preventing further proteotoxic burden to mitochondria.</text>

      <text>In conclusion, our results provide clear evidence for the novel role of CLPP in regulation of mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis through its target&#8208;substrate ERAL1. The level and binding of ERAL1 to the 28S ribosomal subunit needs to be tightly regulated to allow efficient formation of a mature mitoribosome, and we show that ClpXP has an active role in this process. Our study also produced an extensive list of other potential ClpXP substrates that need to be evaluated. Further analyses are clearly necessary to determine their role in mitochondrial physiology.</text>

      <text>Clpp gene targeting was carried out at Taconic Artemis, Germany, in Art B6/3.5 embryonic stem cell line on a genetic background of C57BL/6 NTac. LoxP sites flanked exons 3&#8211;5 of the Clpp gene. A puromycin resistance selection marker was inserted into intron 5 and flanked by F3 sites. The targeted locus was transmitted through germline that resulted in heterozygous Clpp+/PuroR&#8722;loxP mice. Animals were bred with B6 Flp_deleter transgenic (TG) mice to remove the puromycin selection marker. Finally, Clpp+/loxP mice were mated with mice expressing Cre recombinase under the promoter of beta&#8208;actin resulting in deletion of exons 3&#8211;5. This deletion resulted in loss of function of the Clpp gene, by removing a part of the protease domain and generated a frameshift from exon 2&#8211;6. Clpp+/&#8722; heterozygous mice were intercrossed to obtain the Clpp&#8722;/&#8722; homozygous knockout mice. The genotyping primers used are:</text>

As a negative control, cells transfected with the empty plasmid (pcDNA3.1, Invitrogene) were used. Mitochondria were isolated as described below, lysed in a buffer containing 25&#160;mM Tris, 150&#160;M NaCl, 1&#160;mM EDTA, 1% NP&#8208;40, 5% glycerol, protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 7.4, and cleared by 1&#8208;h centrifugation at 20,000&#160;&#215;&#160;g. Anti&#8208;FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) was immobilized on the AminoLink Plus resin (Thermo) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lysates were precleared with the Control Agarose Resin (Thermo) and incubated with immobilized beads overnight at 4&#176;C. Beads were washed five times with the lysis buffer followed by the elution of the immobilized protein complexes with the low pH elution buffer (100&#160;mM glycine; pH 2.8). Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS&#8211;PAGE and stained by Coomassie colloidal blue staining. Protein containing gel slices were trypsinized, separated by the HPLC, and subjected to LC&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS/MS analysis. In total, we identified 286 proteins assigned to the mitochondria and a fraction of 143 proteins were equally detected in samples from CLPP&#8208;deficient cells containing either empty vector or FLAG&#8208;tagged CLPPWT or CLPPS149A protein.</text>

      <text>The measurements of respiratory chain enzyme complex activities and citrate synthase activity were performed as previously described (Wibom et&#160;al, 2002). Oxygen consumption rates were determined with Oxygraph&#8208;2k (Oroboros Instruments) following the substrate&#8211;uncoupler&#8211;inhibitor&#8211;titration (SUIT) protocol. Briefly, mitochondria were isolated as described above and the state 3 was determined in the presence of CI substrates (pyruvate, malate, glutamate). Then, the state 3 for CI&#160;+&#160;CII was estimated after addition of CII substrate, succinate. Next, to evaluate mitochondrial coupling, oligomycin&#8208;mediated inhibition of ATP synthase was performed (state 4) followed by a multiple&#8208;step FCCP titration in order to determine the maximum respiration through the CI&#160;+&#160;CII (uncoupled).</text>

In brief, proteins were washed several times with 8&#160;M Urea, reduced using 10&#160;mM DTT (Dithiothreitol) for 30&#160;min, and alkylated with 55&#160;mM IAA (Iodoacetamide) for 40&#160;min in the dark. Then, conditions were set for digestion using 10&#160;mM Tris&#8211;HCl pH&#160;=&#160;7.5 for several washing steps. Trypsin was added in 1:100 enzyme to protein ratio and incubated at 37&#176;C overnight.

      <text>Generated peptides were desalted prior to liquid chromatography&#8211;tandem mass spectrometry (LC&#8208;MS/MS) analysis using STAGE tip technique2 (Rappsilber et&#160;al, 2003). The eluate was concentrated in a speed vac to complete dryness and resuspended in 10&#160;&#956;l acidified water (Buffer A: 0.1% acetic acid). LC&#8208;MS/MS instrumentation consisted out of an EASY nano&#8208;LC (Proxeon, now Thermo Scientific) coupled via a nano&#8208;electrospray ionization source (Thermo Scientific) to an ion&#8208;trap&#8208;based LTQ Discovery instrument (Thermo Scientific). 4&#160;&#956;l of peptide mixture was loaded onto an in&#8208;house packed 15&#8208;cm column (3&#8208;&#956;m C18 beads, Dr. Maisch). Peptides were separated by a binary buffer system: (A) 0.1% acetic acid and (B) 0.1% acetic acid in acetonitrile and the following gradient was applied: within 220&#160;min, buffer B content was raised in a linear shape from 7% to 20% and further increased within 60&#160;min to 40%. Then, 95% B was used to wash the column and held there for 20&#160;min. The flow rate was constant at 200&#160;nl/min over the complete gradient. After each run, a blank run (5% B&#160;=&#160;const.) was performed to re&#8208;equilibrate the column.</text>

      <text>Eluting peptides from the column were ionized by an applied voltage of 1.8&#160;kV. The capillary voltage was set to 44&#160;V, and Multipole RF Amplifier (Vp&#8208;p) was set to 400. For MS1 scans, a resolution of 30,000 (400&#160;m/z), a maximal injection time of 500&#160;ms, and an AGC&#160;(Automatic gain control) target of 2e5 were used. In a data&#8208;dependent Top10&#160;mode, the 10 most intense peaks were selected for MS2 level scans in the ion trap. A resolution of 7,500 (400&#160;m/z), an AGC target of 1E54, an isolation window of 3.0 Th, and a maximal injection time of 200&#160;ms were used. The normalized collision energy for CID scans was 35, and the activation time for MS2 scans was 30&#160;ms. For both scan types, the injection waveform setting was enabled.</text>

      <text>All raw files were processed by MaxQuant 1.5.1.0 3, and the implemented Andromeda search engine 4. MS/MS spectra were correlated against the mouse Uniprot database (downloaded Feb. 2015) including a list of common contaminants. Search parameters were set as following: minimal peptide length: 7 amino acids; mass tolerance for MS/MS ITMS spectra: 0.5 Dalton. The FDR was estimated by the implemented decoy algorithm utilizing the revert database on the peptide&#8211;spectrum match (PSM) and protein level to&#160;1%. The label&#8208;free quantification, match between runs, and requantification of algorithms were enabled using default settings. Acetylation at the protein N&#8208;term and oxidation of methionine residues were defined as variable modification, and carbamidomethylation at cysteine residues was set as a fixed modification. LFQ intensities were log2 transformed and tested for differential expression using a two&#8208;sided t&#8208;test. To correct against multiple testing errors, the FDR was calculated by a permutation&#8208;based algorithm using a FDR cutoff of 5% and fudge factor s0 of 0.1. To identify significant enriched GO terms, we utilized the 1D enrichment tool in Perseus 5. Data visualization was done in the statistical environment R.</text>
