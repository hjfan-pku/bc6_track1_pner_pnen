      <text>Mitochondrial dynamics and functionality are linked to the autophagic degradative pathway under several stress conditions. However, the interplay between mitochondria and autophagy upon cell death signalling remains unclear. The T&#8208;cell receptor pathway signals the so&#8208;called activation&#8208;induced cell death (AICD) essential for immune tolerance regulation. Here, we show that this apoptotic pathway requires the inhibition of macroautophagy. Protein kinase&#8208;A activation downstream of T&#8208;cell receptor signalling inhibits macroautophagy upon AICD induction. This leads to the accumulation of damaged mitochondria, which are fragmented, display remodelled cristae and release cytochrome c, thereby driving apoptosis. Autophagy&#8208;forced reactivation that clears the Parkin&#8208;decorated mitochondria is as effective in inhibiting apoptosis as genetic interference with cristae remodelling and cytochrome c release. Thus, upon AICD induction regulation of macroautophagy, rather than selective mitophagy, ensures apoptotic progression.</text>

      <text>Most forms of apoptosis induced by intrinsic stimuli are amplified by mitochondria, which release cytochrome c and other factors to activate the program of cell demise. Apoptosis amplification is one of the many essential mitochondrial functions, which also include biosynthetic and metabolic pathways, ATP production, calcium buffering and redox homeostasis (Ernster &amp; Schatz, 1981; Rizzuto et&#160;al, 2000; Scorrano, 2009). The functional variety is paralleled by the dynamic nature of these organelles, whose morphology is regulated by a set of so&#8208;called mitochondria&#8208;shaping proteins (Bereiter&#8208;Hahn &amp; Voth, 1994). Among these, the dynamin&#8208;related GTPases MFN1, MFN2 and OPA1 are the main regulators of mitochondrial fusion, while DRP1, FIS1 and MFF control fragmentation (Chan, 2012). Mitochondrial fragmentation and cristae remodelling have been associated with cell death in many models (Scorrano et&#160;al, 2002; Olichon et&#160;al, 2003; Arnoult et&#160;al, 2005; Frezza et&#160;al, 2006). In addition, mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction mark mitochondria for degradation in the selective autophagic process called mitophagy. Indeed, once damaged and committed to degradation, mitochondria fragment to sterically allow their selective engulfment in autophagosomes. The removal of dysfunctional mitochondria through a selective autophagy, which normally proceeds through a pathway dependent on mitochondrial membrane depolarization and involving PINK1 and Parkin (Narendra et&#160;al, 2008, 2010; Kane et&#160;al, 2014; Lazarou et&#160;al, 2015), acts as a cell pro&#8208;survival mechanism (Choi et&#160;al, 2013). Indeed, if mitophagy could not occur, damaged mitochondria will pile up, making pro&#8208;apoptotic proteins available. On the other hand, if mitophagy is in place, damaged mitochondria will be cleared and will not contribute pro&#8208;apoptotic molecules. The&#160;latter scenario is clearly in conflict with the requirement for mitochondria&#8208;derived pro&#8208;apoptotic molecules during the progression of cell death. The importance of fragmentation for mitophagy is substantiated by the discovery that, conversely, during macroautophagy (a non&#8208;selective autophagic process, active in basal or nutrient&#8208;depleted conditions to ensure a proper metabolic recycling (Cecconi &amp; Levine, 2008); hereafter &#8220;autophagy&#8221;), mitochondria elongate and are excluded from autophagosomes in order to maintain ATP production and sustain cell viability (Gomes &amp; Scorrano, 2013). Since during apoptosis mitochondria are fragmented and dysfunctional, but not degraded, mitophagy should be inhibited.</text>

      <text>An added complication in the study of the relationship between mitophagy and apoptosis is intrinsic in the models used to study them, thus involving chemicals and toxins, which likely unspecifically affect multiple cellular functions. However, a model of physiological apoptosis where mitochondria have been shown to be essential exists: the so&#8208;called activation&#8208;induced cell death (AICD) of T lymphocytes.</text>

      <text>Development, activation, expansion and death of T cells are tightly regulated processes to balance an effective immune response with the avoidance of autoimmunity. Apoptosis occurs so as to establish immune tolerance in the thymus by removing autoreactive cells, or to provoke peripheral tolerance by deleting the expanded T&#8208;cell clones after resolution of inflammation in the process of AICD (Smith et&#160;al, 1989; Shi et&#160;al, 1991; Dhein et&#160;al, 1995). Mechanistically, in AICD, signals generated by the TCR lead to CD95/FAS ligand (CD95/FASL) expression and autocrine activation (Latinis et&#160;al, 1997; Brenner et&#160;al, 2005), with the engagement of the caspase&#8208;8&#8208;dependent extrinsic pathway of cell death (Brunner et&#160;al, 1995; Dhein et&#160;al, 1995). Mitochondria participate at every stage of AICD. The kinase PKC&#952;&#8208; and DRP1&#8208;dependent mitochondria&#8208;derived ROS are necessary for CD95L expression and AICD (Villalba et&#160;al, 1999; Kaminski et&#160;al, 2007, 2012; Roth et&#160;al, 2014); caspase&#8208;independent release of AIF from mitochondria is also crucial for AICD (Chhabra et&#160;al, 2006). Despite mounting evidence for a role of mitochondrial dynamics in other T&#8208;cell functions, such as immune synapse establishment and migration (Campello et&#160;al, 2006; Contento et&#160;al, 2010), how the organelle shaping is involved in AICD is still not completely understood. A simple prediction would be that they do not fragment, so that they could be spared from mitophagy ultimately enabling them to supply the molecules required for apoptosis progression. However, DRP1&#8208;dependent mitochondrial fission has been shown to support AICD by ROS production (Roth et&#160;al, 2014).</text>

      <text>Here, we set out to investigate whether and how mitochondria, mitophagy and autophagy crosstalk in AICD, a physiological form of cell death. Our results indicate that an early and massive fragmentation of mitochondria is counterbalanced not by the expected and specific inhibition of selective mitophagy, but by a generalized blockage in autophagy. If this block is released, mitochondria are&#160;eliminated and the apoptotic circuitry is interrupted. Thus, in a&#160;physiological cell death setting, to ensure apoptosis, macroautophagy needs to be inhibited.</text>

      <text>Upon AICD induction in human peripheral blood T (hPB T) cells, cell death started ~30&#160;min (Fig&#160;1A) and it reached a plateau soon after. The 40% of cells still alive after 32&#8211;48&#160;h most likely represent subpopulations of hPB T cells differentially sensitive to AICD (Krammer et&#160;al, 2007; Julia et&#160;al, 2009). Indeed, TCR restimulation killed, albeit more slowly, the totality of clonal Jurkat cells, a T&#8208;cell line phenotypically comparable to pre&#8208;activated and expanded lymphocytes, and widely used in AICD studies (Fig&#160;1B) (Dhein et&#160;al, 1995). We therefore monitored mitochondrial morphology around or before the time of cell death in primary T (30&#160;min) and Jurkat (24&#160;h) cells. The elongated mitochondrial network, clearly visible in resting cells, underwent massive fragmentation (Fig&#160;1C&#8211;F). Interestingly, the fragmentation appeared before the onset of cell death (starting around 16&#160;h after TCR engagement in Jurkat, not shown), thus being at variance with what has been observed in other models&#160;of apoptosis (Frank et&#160;al, 2001). Notably, mitochondrial fragmentation was accompanied by ultrastructural rearrangements, as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy (EM) analysis. Indeed, AICD stimulation induced cristae remodelling, with increased cristae maximal width in treated cells compared to the tight structures observed in control hPB T and Jurkat cells (Fig&#160;1G and H). In addition, matrix of hPB T cells undergoing AICD was electron dense, likely mirroring a different metabolic state of their mitochondria during apoptosis (Fig&#160;1G). A co&#8208;localization analysis also confirmed that cytochrome c release accompanied the observed mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig&#160;1I&#8211;L). In summary, mitochondrial fragmentation and cristae remodelling correlate with cytochrome c release during AICD.</text>

      <text>In order to characterize the molecular mechanisms behind mitochondrial fragmentation and cristae remodelling, we addressed whether levels of the mitochondria&#8208;shaping proteins changed during AICD. Long OPA1 forms were processed and DRP1 levels were slightly increased, while the other mitochondria&#8208;shaping proteins remained unaffected (Fig&#160;2A), suggesting a role for OPA1 and DRP1 in AICD. Indeed, when we overexpressed MFN1, MFN2, a dominant&#8208;negative mutant of DRP1 (DRP1K38A) and OPA1 in Jurkat cells, we found that only DRP1K38A and OPA1 were able to protect from AICD (Fig&#160;2B), similar to what observed in other cell death models (Frank et&#160;al, 2001; Frezza et&#160;al, 2006; Cassidy&#8208;Stone et&#160;al, 2008). DRP1K38A and OPA1 overexpression inhibited mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig&#160;2C and D), cristae remodelling (Fig&#160;2E and F) and cytochrome c release (Fig&#160;2G and H). Conversely, MFN1 overexpression, which was unable to protect from AICD, counteracted mitochondrial fragmentation but had no effect on cristae disorganization and cytochrome c release (unpublished data, from M. Corrado and S. Campello). Mechanistically, we could correlate&#160;AICD&#8208;associated mitochondrial fragmentation to calcineurin&#8208;dependent DRP1 translocation to mitochondria (Cereghetti et&#160;al, 2008). Indeed, when we buffered intracellular Ca2+ using the calcium chelator BAPTA to counteract the early rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration following TCR engagement (Quintana et&#160;al, 2005; Srikanth &amp; Gwack, 2013), mitochondrial fragmentation, as well as cell death, was inhibited (Fig&#160;EV1A&#8211;C). Moreover, genetic inhibition of calcineurin (&#8710;CnAH151Q) or of DRP1 translocation (DRP1S637D) recapitulated these data (Fig&#160;EV1D&#8211;F), demonstrating that calcium&#8208;dependent modulation of mitochondrial fragmentation and cristae structure amplifies AICD. In sum, our data indicate that mitochondrial cristae remodelling is a crucial aspect for AICD progression.</text>

      <text>Our data raise the question of why the fragmented, dysfunctional mitochondria of AICD&#8208;primed cells are not targeted to mitophagy and sustain cytochrome c release. We therefore decided to verify whether the mitophagic and autophagic machineries were competent upon AICD. When we went back to our ultrastructural analysis of primary cells undergoing AICD, we noticed that autophagic structures disappeared after TCR reactivation (Fig&#160;1G and H). Conversely, translocation of Parkin, a ubiquitin E3 ligase whose mitochondrial translocation is required for their degradation through selective mitophagy, to fragmented and remodelled Jurkat mitochondria upon AICD was normal (Fig&#160;3A and B, and Appendix&#160;Fig S1A). However, the capacity of LC3 to be recruited and co&#8208;localize with Parkin to mitochondria during AICD was reduced (see Fig&#160;3A and C). Indeed, an impaired autophagy in hPB T cells was further substantiated, on time course, by the finding that as early as 30&#160;min upon AICD induction LC3&#8208;Cherry&#8208;positive puncta, indicative of active autophagy (Klionsky et&#160;al, 2012), were absent in the population of dying cells (Fig&#160;3D and E, and Appendix&#160;Fig S1B). In Jurkat cells, GFP&#8208;LC3 relocalization as well as processing was similarly inhibited in the early stages of AICD, even before mitochondria fragmentation (Fig&#160;3F&#8211;H). Notably, knocking down Parkin increased cell sensibility to AICD (Fig&#160;EV2A) by increasing mitochondrial depolarization and decreasing the total and the long OPA1 form levels (Fig&#160;EV2B&#8211;E). The latter observations indicate that, in resting&#8212;non&#8208;AICD&#8208;stimulated&#8212;conditions, a basal turnover of mitochondria is assured by Parkin in Jurkat cells, confirming that subpopulations of polarized and depolarized mitochondria coexist within the cells (see also Fig&#160;EV5E upper left panel) and that basal clearance of depolarized organelles is functional to maintain cell survival (Twig &amp; Shirihai, 2011). Our results show that during AICD the pathways responsible for Parkin translocation to mitochondria are functional and activated, but bulk autophagy is early inhibited, thereby impeding the progression of mitophagy and so allowing the accumulation of dysfunctional, fragmented mitochondria that can sustain cytochrome c release.</text>

      <infon key="type">paragraph</infon>
      <offset>22077</offset>
      <text>Upon TCR engagement, the pleiotropic protein kinase&#8208;A (PKA) known to specifically target several autophagy players (Stephan et&#160;al, 2009) is activated (Mosenden &amp; Tasken, 2011). Among those players lies AMPK, a central autophagy regulator acting via a complex crosstalk with other autophagic factors (Egan et&#160;al, 2011). PKA phosphorylates AMPK on Ser485/491, counteracting its pro&#8208;autophagic phosphorylation on Thr172 (Hurley et&#160;al, 2006), and therefore inhibiting autophagy (Pulinilkunnil et&#160;al, 2011). Moreover, in adipocytes, AMPK was shown to be specifically phosphorylated by PKA on two other serines together with Ser485/491: Ser173 and Ser497&#8212;the additional phosphorylation on Ser173 being crucial for the inhibitory effect on Thr172, and thus for AMPK activity (Djouder et&#160;al, 2010). Interestingly, upon AICD induction we observed increased phosphorylation of AMPK Ser485/491 and Ser173, while Thr172 phosphorylation levels were unchanged, suggesting a PKA&#8208;mediated inhibition of AMPK (Figs&#160;4A and B, and EV3A and B). We further verified whether AMPK activity was inhibited during AICD by checking the AMPK&#8208;dependent phosphorylation of its downstream target ULK1 on Ser555. ULK1&#8208;relative phosphorylation diminished concomitantly with the inhibitory AMPK phosphorylation early upon TCR restimulation (Fig&#160;EV3C and D), as eventually did the ULK1&#8208;dependent Ser318 phosphorylation of ATG13 (Fig&#160;EV3E and F). A long&#8208;term adaptation to medium condition could explain the reduction in ULK1 phosphorylation at late time points, also in control conditions. Nonetheless, this adaptation happens when the inhibition of autophagy is already established. Moreover, the difference observed in ULK1, at late time points, is not paralleled by a difference in the phosphorylation status of the downstream effector and direct ULK1&#8208;substrate ATG13, in control conditions (Fig&#160;EV3E and F). Besides AMPK, autophagy is also regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). A complex regulatory phosphorylation network among mTOR, AMPK and the downstream autophagic effectors is known (Alers et&#160;al, 2012). With this premise, we also analysed the phosphorylation status of mTOR during AICD, and it remained unchanged (Fig&#160;EV3G and H), suggesting that the mTOR kinase does not play a central role in TCR&#8208;dependent autophagy inhibition.</text>

      <text>Given that PKA&#8208;mediated phosphorylation inhibits AMPK during AICD, we decided to verify whether AICD was effective in cells overexpressing specific phospho&#8208;silencing mutants only on Ser485/491 (S485/491A) or on both Ser485/491 and Ser173 (S173A&#8208;S485/491A). While the single mutant S485/491A partially inhibited AICD, the double S173A&#8208;S485/491A mutant showed a stronger inhibitory effect on apoptosis progression (Fig&#160;4C), through restoration of AMPK pro&#8208;autophagic activity, as confirmed by the analysis of LC3 processing and AMPK&#8208;dependent ULK1 phosphorylation (Figs&#160;4D and EV4A&#8211;C). Moreover, the double mutant consequently reduced the mitochondrial markers accumulation (Fig&#160;EV4D and E). Conversely, AMPK silencing in Jurkat cells significantly accelerated AICD (Fig&#160;EV2A). In sum, our data indicate that the PKA&#8211;AMPK axis downstream of the TCR modulates autophagy inhibition during AICD.</text>

      <text>PKA also controls the activity of the autophagic key player LC3 by phosphorylating its Ser12, a post&#8208;translational modification that inhibits LC3 processing and ultimately blocks autophagy (Cherra et&#160;al, 2010). Interestingly, Ser12 LC3 phosphorylation also increased during AICD (Fig&#160;4E and F) and the expression of a wild type, as well as of the non&#8208;phosphorylable S12A LC3 mutant, protected Jurkat cells from AICD (Fig&#160;4F and G) at variance with its phospho&#8208;mimetic LC3&#8208;S12D mutant form, whose transfection does not alter cell viability (Fig&#160;4G). Thus, upon TCR engagement, PKA inhibits autophagy also via the direct regulation of LC3 activation.</text>

      <text>We finally wished to test the upstream role of PKA in AICD&#8208;induced autophagy inhibition. When PKA was pharmacologically inhibited during AICD, AMPK Ser485/491 phosphorylation was reduced (Figs&#160;4H and EV4F), autophagy inhibition was delayed and LC3 activation was increased&#8212;although not significantly (Figs&#160;4I and EV4G). The reactivation of autophagy leads, ultimately, to reduction in cell death (Fig&#160;4J), also in primary T cells (Fig&#160;4K), through the removal of damaged mitochondria as indicated by the reduction in mitochondrial marker accumulation and of depolarized mitochondria upon PKA pharmacological inhibition (Fig&#160;EV4H&#8211;J). In sum, our results indicate that PKA inhibits ULK1&#8208;mediated autophagy, responsible for the clearance of the dysfunctional mitochondria, through a double action on AMPK and LC3.</text>

      <text>We next reasoned that if autophagy (and not selective mitophagy) inhibition allowed AICD progression, its pharmacological induction would inhibit cell death. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, specifically chosen among the autophagy pharmacological inducers because it acts through a pathway alternative to the AMPK axis, was indeed effective in blunting AICD in hPB T cells (Fig&#160;5A) and in Jurkat cells (Fig&#160;5B) through autophagy restoration (Fig&#160;EV5A and B). Rapamycin not only&#8212;as expected&#8212;induced mitochondrial elongation (Gomes et&#160;al, 2011) (Fig&#160;5C), but also recovered cristae structure (Fig&#160;5D) and reduced cytochrome c release (Fig&#160;5E).</text>

      <text>In principle, the amelioration of the mitochondrial population parameters by rapamycin could result from degrading the unhealthy, ultrastructurally and morphologically compromised mitochondria releasing cytochrome c, or by triggering DRP1&#8208;dependent mitochondrial elongation (Gomes et&#160;al, 2011). Two sets of experiments let us lean towards the first hypothesis. First, rapamycin was also effective in inhibiting AICD (Fig&#160;5F) and cytochrome c release (Fig&#160;5G) in Jurkat cells expressing a DRP1 mutant (DRP1S637A) that cannot be phosphorylated and constitutively localizes on mitochondria, thus retaining fragmentation irrespective of autophagy induction (Figs&#160;5H and EV5C). Moreover, the expression of the dominant&#8208;negative DRP1K38A mutant was additive to rapamycin in reducing cell death (Fig&#160;5I), suggesting that mitochondrial structural changes and autophagy inhibition are parallel pathways that amplify cell death upon AICD stimulation. Second, while autophagy physiological inhibition during AICD leads to mitochondrial accumulation, its reactivation by rapamycin allowed clearance of mitochondria (Figs&#160;6A&#8211;C and EV5D). Notably, at a molecular level, MnSOD accumulation during AICD is higher compared to TOM20. This could be explained by the different mitochondrial sub&#8208;localization of the two proteins examined. Indeed, TOM20 similar to&#160;other outer mitochondrial membrane proteins could be ubiquitylated and removed also via the proteasome. Eventually, autophagy restoration&#8212;by rapamycin treatment&#8212;was able to clear Parkin&#8208;decorated mitochondria, as suggested by the increased co&#8208;localization of Parkin and LC3 puncta on mitochondria during AICD in the presence of rapamycin (Fig&#160;6D and E), favouring the purification towards a population of healthier, non&#8208;depolarized mitochondria (Fig&#160;EV5E). Obviously, we cannot rule out that other relevant autophagy cargoes contribute to AICD regulation.</text>

      <text>Our in&#160;vitro results predict that autophagy, rather than selective mitophagy, is a core mechanism regulating the extent of AICD by controlling the mitochondrial units capable of cytochrome c release. If this model held true in&#160;vivo, AICD should be increased in mouse models of reduced autophagy. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of two mouse models where autophagy is genetically impaired. In the first one, a single allele of Ambra1&#8212;a signalling protein&#8208;activating autophagy via Beclin 1&#8212;is deleted, thus reducing the levels of basal autophagy and response to autophagic stimuli (Fimia et&#160;al, 2007; Vazquez et&#160;al, 2012; Cianfanelli et&#160;al, 2015). Of note, splenocytes isolated from 6&#8208;month Ambra1gt/+ mice were more sensitive to AICD than their wild&#8208;type littermate T cells (Fig&#160;7A). The second model that we used consists in an Atg7flox/flox mouse, by which autophagy progression can be inactivated (Komatsu et&#160;al, 2005). T cells isolated from wild&#8208;type and Atg7flox/flox animals were infected with retroviral vectors expressing the CRE recombinase, thus resulting in the deletion of the ATG7 protein. Similar to the AMBRA1 model, also Atg7&#8208;depleted cells were more sensitive to AICD, when compared to wild&#8208;type counterparts (Fig&#160;7B). Interestingly, in contrast to what observed in wt cells, rapamycin was not able to rescue Atg7&#8208;deficient cells from AICD (Fig&#160;7B). Knocking&#8208;down ATG7 in Jurkat cells recapitulated the ex&#160;vivo data (Fig&#160;7C). Moreover, rapamycin was able to reduce the number of cells with depolarized mitochondria and the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria during AICD only in wt T cells (Fig&#160;7D&#8211;F).</text>

      <text>How mitochondrial morphology, mitophagy and macroautophagy crosstalk to define cell survival upon relevant forms of apoptosis is unclear. Our data demonstrate that macroautophagy rather than a selective mitophagy downregulation allows the progression of AICD (Fig&#160;8). In particular, our data show that inhibition of autophagy precedes and allows the accumulation of fragmented and dysfunctional mitochondria, probably together with other organelles or bulk materials, which unopposedly release pro&#8208;apoptotic factors, thus amplifying and effecting AICD (Fig&#160;8).</text>

Early after AICD induction PKA activation induces inhibition of AMPK/ULK1&#8208;dependent autophagy as well as a direct block of LC3. Subsequently, mitochondria fragment in a calcineurin&#8208;/DRP1&#8208;dependent manner. The lack of the removal of mitochondria results in accumulation of dysfunctional and damaged organelles releasing cytochrome c, thus amplifying cell death signals.</text>

      <text>Further, our data indicate that AICD, a physiological death process modulating T&#8208;cell homeostasis through reactivation of the T&#8208;cell receptor, is characterized not only by mitochondrial fragmentation before the onset of apoptosis but also by cristae remodelling. Several other reports show that mitochondrial morphology and ultrastructure vary during apoptosis with DRP1&#8208;dependent organelle fragmentation and OPA1&#8208;dependent remodelling of the cristae, both controlling the rate and extent of cytochrome c release (Scorrano, 2009). The role of cristae remodelling, originally described in isolated mitochondria and intact cells (Scorrano et&#160;al, 2002), was observed only in models of intrinsic pharmacologically or artificially induced cell death (Yamaguchi et&#160;al, 2008; Landes et&#160;al, 2010). Indeed, our data provide the first evidence for cristae remodelling in a physiological relevant form of cell death, essential to define the immune response.</text>

      <text>Mitochondria were already known to be involved in AICD progression: TCR engagement leads to cleavage of the pro&#8208;apoptotic factor Bim, its translocation to the organelle being crucial for the induction of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (Hughes et&#160;al, 2008; Snow et&#160;al, 2008). Moreover, recent findings point to an amplification feedback control in AICD, by which the apoptosome may induce cleavage of anti&#8208;apoptotic factors, such as Bcl&#8208;2 and Bcl&#8208;XL (Guerrero et&#160;al, 2013). Finally, mitochondria are linked to AICD by the fact that mitochondrially produced reactive oxygen species are master regulators of this cell death, through Ca2+&#8208;dependent modulation of CD95L transcription and expression, and hence induction of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway (Krammer et&#160;al, 2007; Roth et&#160;al, 2014). However, all these events take place and become crucial in late phases of AICD, representing an amplification and probable stabilization of the process. By contrast, we highlight here events that engage mitochondria during the early steps of AICD, when apparently the cell fate is already determined. Indeed, organelle fragmentation as well as cytochrome c release is detectable just a few minutes after TCR induction in T lymphocytes, before any possible transcriptional change and of course much earlier than apoptosome recruitment.</text>

      <text>Given the deleterious effects of TCR reactivation, it comes with no surprise that the strength of TCR activation is tightly controlled at the level of TCR molecules (Holst et&#160;al, 2008). Our data suggest that autophagy emerges as a second line of defence against TCR re&#8208;ensuing signals, a routine that is inhibited by the signal emanating from the receptor. Indeed, autophagy inhibition represents another important early response to TCR engagement. The catabolic process of autophagy, besides its key role as a cytosolic clearance system to prevent cell damage in basal condition, often represents an initial and effective cell response to a number of stress stimuli, ranging from hypoxia, to nutrient starvation or to DNA damage (Kroemer et&#160;al, 2010). This first autophagic &#8220;barrier&#8221; is able in many instances to slow down or stop the apoptotic process.</text>

      <text>A number of key factors, often kinases, tightly regulate the autophagy onset or progression, by sensing the stimulus and activating or inhibiting the autophagy signalling network. Among the upstream autophagy signalling, molecules regulating this response are the master metabolic regulators AMPK and mTOR, the former having been identified very recently as a regulator of the effector T&#8208;cell metabolic homeostasis (Blagih et&#160;al, 2015). Downstream, together with the key autophagosome&#8208;shaping molecule LC3, the main targets of this regulation are the autophagy kinase ULK1 and its substrates Ambra1, ATG13 and FIP200 (Mizushima &amp; Komatsu, 2011). Of note, even though many natural or synthetic compounds such as rapamycin or torin1 can induce autophagy, little is known about specific conditions or factors triggering autophagy downregulation in response to specific stimuli. Two examples are the two Beclin 1&#8208;interacting proteins Rubicon and Bcl&#8208;2, both of which impair the assembly and function of the autophagy nucleation complex (Zhong et&#160;al, 2009; He et&#160;al, 2012) and actively inhibit autophagy. Later on in the process, pro&#8208;autophagic factors can be cleaved by caspases (e.g. Beclin 1, Ambra1 and Atg5) (Gordy &amp; He, 2012; Pagliarini et&#160;al, 2012) to soften the autophagy response and unleash the apoptotic program. Our work identifies a molecular axis, involving AMPK, ULK1 and ATG13, that is early downregulated in the context of the TCR response, together with a direct inhibition of LC3 processing. These inhibitions both depend on PKA and slow down or even prevent the removal of damaged and fragmented mitochondria (Fig&#160;7).</text>

      <text>Our work contributes to dissect the role of mitophagy versus that of macroautophagy in apoptosis: macroautophagy inhibition instead of specific mitophagy inhibition prevents the mitochondria releasing cytochrome c to be cleared from cells committed to AICD. It will be interesting to investigate the differential role of mitophagy versus autophagy in the amplification of different forms of apoptosis and of cell death in general. The involvement of the&#160;macroautophagy upstream signalling network in AICD (see above)&#160;points to a faster protection from mitochondria removal, before mitochondrial damage could be signalled through specific mitophagy cargoes and translated into a specific activation of mitophagy. Also, downregulation of ULK1 function leads in general to a lack of activation of its downstream targets, including Ambra1 and Beclin 1. These factors are in part mitochondria resident, and Ambra1 has been postulated to be a key factor in Parkin recruitment to the organelles (Van Humbeeck et&#160;al, 2011). This would explain the urge in AICD signalling for a macroautophagy inhibition, thus preceding activation of Parkin (or other mitophagy cargoes) translocation and clearance of mitochondria. Not by chance, we observed that T cells from Ambra1&#8208;deficient mice and Atg7&#8208;deficient T cells are more sensitive to AICD. Second, in our&#160;experiments we pharmacologically rescued autophagy with rapamycin, often used as an immune suppressor. However, a dose&#8208;dependent paradoxical effect of this drug has been recently demonstrated in primary T cells. At low doses, rapamycin increases the reactive lymphocyte population and decreases AICD in the inflammatory eye disease uveitis, through a mechanism still unclear to the authors (Zhang et&#160;al, 2012). We can hypothesize that rapamycin treatment actively protects the cells by removing damaged mitochondria and, in addition, by increasing the levels of&#160;anti&#8208;apoptotic proteins (some of them, indeed, reside on mitochondria and are known regulators of autophagy). We could thus speculate that rapamycin treatment gives rise to a population of cells more resistant to AICD for which additional, or higher, TCR stimulation is probably necessary.</text>

      <text>Moreover, our in&#160;vivo data in Ambra1&#8208;deficient mice and Atg7&#8208;deficient cells prompt us to speculate that, in cellular models of genetic ablation of autophagy, mitochondrial quality control could be compromised. This could result, in turn, in the accumulation over time of damaged mitochondria, thus contributing to cellular dysfunction and, at the organism level, to ageing or development of different pathologies. Finally, our results on autophagy inhibition in AICD may reveal a potential therapeutic strategy whenever AICD modulation is beneficial. For example, autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, have been related to defects in central and peripheral tolerance, and thus to AICD (Gronski &amp; Weinem, 2006) and AICD is a crucial pathogenic feature of other autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (Waiczies et&#160;al, 2002; Julia et&#160;al, 2009).</text>

      <text>Human PB T cells were sorted by negative selection using a RosetteSep kit (StemCell Technologies Inc.). Mouse spleens were harvested from Ambra1+/gt (Fimia et&#160;al, 2007), wt C57BL/6 or ATG7 flox/flox (Komatsu et&#160;al, 2005) mice to isolate mouse splenocytes. Jurkat E6.1 and primary T cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FCS, 2&#160;mM L&#8208;glutamine, sodium pyruvate 1&#160;mM (GIBCO Life Tecn.), non&#8208;essential amino acids (GIBCO Life Tecn.), 100&#160;U/ml penicillin and 100&#160;&#956;g/ml streptomycin. In addition, primary T&#8208;cell medium was supplemented with 100&#160;&#956;g/ml gentamycin. Primary T cells were activated by PHA (Biochrom AG) 1.2&#160;&#956;g/ml for 16&#160;h. After that, the cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in medium supplemented with IL&#8208;2 (Roche) 25&#160;U/ml for 6&#160;days before being used for experiments at day 7. Every 48&#160;h, after wash with PBS, new IL&#8208;2 was added to the medium. Infections were performed at day 5 after activation. Blood from healthy donors was provided by the University Hospital (H&#244;pitaux Universitaires de Gen&#232;ve, Gen&#232;ve, Switzerland), which approved the use of donor blood for laboratory experiments and obtained informed consent from all subjects.</text>
