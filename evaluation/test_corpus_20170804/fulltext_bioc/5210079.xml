      <text>The liver has an intrinsic capacity to regenerate in response to injury or surgical resection. Nevertheless, circumstances in which hepatocytes are unresponsive to proliferative signals result in impaired regeneration and hepatic failure. As the Hippo pathway has a canonical role in the maintenance of liver size, we investigated whether it could serve as a therapeutic target to support regeneration. Using a standard two&#8208;thirds partial hepatectomy (PH) model in young and aged mice, we demonstrate that the Hippo pathway is modulated across the phases of liver regeneration. The activity of the core kinases MST1 and LATS1 increased during the early hypertrophic phase and returned to steady state levels in the proliferative phase, coinciding with activation of YAP1 target genes and hepatocyte proliferation. Moreover, following PH in aged mice, we demonstrate that Hippo signaling is anomalous in non&#8208;regenerating livers. We provide pre&#8208;clinical evidence that silencing the Hippo core kinases MST1 and MST2 with siRNA provokes hepatocyte proliferation in quiescent livers and rescues liver regeneration in aged mice following PH. Our data suggest that targeting the Hippo core kinases MST1/2 has therapeutic potential to improve regeneration in non&#8208;regenerative disorders.</text>

      <text>Due to its intrinsic capacity to regenerate&#8212;the liver has been at the forefront of clinical regenerative medicine and enables surgical treatments for numerous hepatic disorders. Livers of patients with cancer, parasitic infections or diseases that result in acute or chronic liver failure can be resected or transplanted using living&#8208;related or split&#8208;liver donor organs. In each circumstance, patient recovery depends on the remnant liver mass to undergo compensatory growth to return to its original weight and functional capacity. Compensatory growth, or liver regeneration, following partial hepatectomy is a rapid and efficient process in which the normally quiescent hepatocyte population re&#8208;enters cell cycle and proliferates until the restoration of lost hepatic mass (Michalopoulos &amp; DeFrances, 2010; Taub, 2010). However, there are cases in which regeneration fails and this results in hepatic insufficiency and acute hepatic failure, known clinically as small for size syndrome (SFSS) (Troisi et&#160;al, 2001; Zhong et&#160;al, 2008a). Susceptible livers for SFSS include those with cirrhosis or hepatosteatosis. Interestingly, ageing is also an adverse factor for liver regeneration; several studies in mice and humans demonstrated an age&#8208;dependent decline in the liver's regenerative capacity following PH (Fry et&#160;al, 2015; Iakova et&#160;al, 2005; Ledda&#8208;Columbano et&#160;al, 1997; Schmucker &amp; Sanchez, 2004). Although liver regeneration has been extensively investigated, many regulatory pathways remain elusive and to date, there is no non&#8208;invasive pharmacological means to support regeneration for clinical use. In this study, we investigated a potential targeted treatment to improve regeneration through inhibition of the Hippo pathway.</text>

      <text>The Hippo pathway was originally identified in Drosophila by screening for mutations resulting in organomegaly (Xu et&#160;al, 2003; Harvey et&#160;al, 2014; Huang et&#160;al, 2012; Edgar, 2007; Camargo et&#160;al, 1964; Dong et&#160;al, 2014). The pathway is conserved in mammals and regulates organ size and maintains tissue stem cells (Dong et&#160;al, 2014; Pan, 2015; Varelas et&#160;al, 2004; Alarcon et&#160;al, 2009; Lian et&#160;al, 2004; Yimlamai et&#160;al, 1999). The core pathway is composed of serine&#8211;threonine kinases, mammalian Ste20&#8208;like protein kinase 1 and 2 [MST1/serine&#8208;threonine kinase 4 (STK4)] and [MST2/serine&#8208;threonine kinase 3 (STK3)] and the large tumour suppressor kinase 1 and 2 (LATS1) and (LATS2), the scaffold protein Salvador (Sav1) and co&#8208;factor Mob1. Its main downstream effectors are the transcription co&#8208;activators Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional co&#8208;activator with PDZ&#8208;binding motif (TAZ) (Kanai et&#160;al, 2006; Huang et&#160;al, 2012). When the canonical Hippo pathway is active, MST1/2 phosphorylates Sav1 facilitating its interaction and the phosphorylation of LATS1/2 (Wu et&#160;al, 2002). Mob1 interacts directly with LATS promoting LATS auto&#8208;phosphorylation. Active p&#8208;LATS1/2 phosphorylates YAP1 and TAZ, which facilitates their binding to 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 restricting them to the cytosolic fraction (Basu et&#160;al, 2003). Of note, it has been proposed that in the liver YAP1 phosphorylation is not solely dependent on p&#8208;LATS1/2 and can involve other intermediate kinases downstream of MST1/2 (Zhou et&#160;al, 2008b). When the Hippo pathway is inactivated, YAP and TAZ are maintained in the nucleus and bind with transcription factors such as p73, PAX3, PPAR&#947;, RUNXs, SMAD, TBX5, PEBP2&#945;, ErbB4 and their primary binding partners, TEAD proteins (Yagi et&#160;al, 2011; Strano et&#160;al, 2011; Vassilev et&#160;al, 2003; Basu et&#160;al, 2003; Komuro et&#160;al, 2012; Hong et&#160;al, 1931; Murakami et&#160;al, 2012; Zhao et&#160;al, 2016,b; Alarcon et&#160;al, 2009). Genes regulated by YAP activation are those that are involved in cell proliferation and tissue growth, among which are ctgf, cyr61, Birc5, Ccnb1, Foxm1 and Areg (Dong et&#160;al, 2014; Zhao et&#160;al, 2009; Zhang et&#160;al, 2015; Xin et&#160;al, 2013; Mizuno et&#160;al, 1997).</text>

      <text>In transgenic models, the hepatic specific deletion of the Hippo kinases, MST1/2, provokes hepatocyte proliferation and liver overgrowth (Zhou et&#160;al, 2008b; Lu et&#160;al, 2010; Song et&#160;al, 2015) and a similar outcome is obtained with liver&#8208;specific YAP1 overexpression (Camargo et&#160;al, 1964; Dong et&#160;al, 2014). Here, we further investigated whether proteins in the Hippo pathway are regulated by regenerative signals following PH and play a physiological role in the control of liver size. We describe that the expression and function of proteins in the Hippo pathway are differentially regulated in young compared to aged livers following partial hepatectomy and support that targeting its core kinases MST1/2 with siRNA is a potential therapeutic intervention to improve the regenerative capacity of resected livers.</text>

      <text>Partial hepatectomy (PH) in rodents is a well&#8208;established, robust model to study the complex processes involved in liver regeneration (Higgins &amp; Anderson, 2003). We questioned how the Hippo pathway is regulated during liver regeneration by assessing the expression and activation of the core kinases MST and LATS as well as their effector protein YAP1 in C57Bl/6J mice following PH. Ki67 immunostaining was used to identify hepatocytes re&#8208;entering cell cycle. Less than 2% of hepatocytes were Ki67 positive during the hypertrophic phase (0&#8211;24&#160;h post&#8208;PH) of liver regeneration (Miyaoka et&#160;al, 2010), whereas up to 75% of hepatocytes became positive during the proliferative phase (24&#8211;48&#160;h post&#8208;PH) with peak Ki67 expression around 40&#160;h (Fig&#160;1A). Interestingly, we observed an increase of the active, phosphorylated form of MST and LATS (p&#8208;MST1/2 and p&#8208;LATS1) 6 and 24&#160;h post&#8208;PH, which coincides with the non&#8208;proliferative, hypertrophic phase of the liver following PH (Fig&#160;1B). As the liver advanced into the proliferative phase (24&#8211;48&#160;h post&#8208;PH), levels of p&#8208;MST1/2 and p&#8208;LATS1 decreased to steady state levels. No significant changes in MST1 protein were detected post&#8208;PH and no conclusion could be drawn on MST2 due to the high background of the antibody (Appendix&#160;Fig S1A and B). Total LATS1 protein (150&#160;kDa) steadily increased 24&#8211;48&#160;h post&#8208;PH (Fig&#160;1B and Appendix&#160;Fig S1A) supporting its role in a YAP&#8208;induced feedback mechanism regulation the Hippo pathway (Moroishi et&#160;al, 2012). The antibody used to detect active MST recognizes both p&#8208;MST1 and p&#8208;MST2 at Thr183 and Thr180, respectively, and detected the cleaved protein as a 34 and 27&#160;kDa fragment (Praskova et&#160;al, 2015) (Fig&#160;1B). The band identified as p&#8208;LATS1 (Ser909) migrated at approximately 150&#160;kDa which was confirmed in a siRNA knockdown experiment (Appendix&#160;Fig S2).</text>

      <text>There was no significant transcriptional change in Mst1, Mst2 or Lats1 mRNA at 6, 24 or 48&#160;h post&#8208;PH (Appendix&#160;Fig S3A). Activation of the Hippo effector protein YAP1 was evident 48&#160;h post&#8208;PH by its increased expression in nuclear&#8208;enriched proteins isolated from liver tissue (Fig&#160;1C) and by its positive nuclear staining in hepatocytes (Fig&#160;1D). To provide further evidence that the parenchymal cells are in part responsible for the increase of YAP protein following PH, we demonstrated that YAP and TAZ are both detectable in isolated cultures of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes (Fig&#160;EV1). In addition, there is an increase of YAP expression in hepatocytes isolated from regenerating livers 48&#160;h after surgery compared to sham&#8208;operated controls (Fig&#160;1E). YAP activation was further confirmed by an up&#8208;regulation of its target genes, Birc5 (68&#8208;fold), Foxm1B (80&#8208;fold) and the mitotic cyclin, Ccnb1 (27&#8208;fold) 48&#160;h post&#8208;PH (Fig&#160;1F). There was no significant change of the YAP target gene Ctgf (Appendix&#160;Fig S3B) or of Yap1 itself, whereas there was significant modulation of Taz mRNA expression post&#8208;PH (Appendix&#160;Fig S3C). These data provide evidence that the Hippo kinases are regulated during the events following PH and YAP is active in regenerating livers.</text>

      <text>We next assessed for age&#8208;related differences in the regulation of Hippo pathway proteins by performing a 60% PH in aged (&gt;&#160;12&#160;months old) and young (6&#8211;8&#160;week) mice. A fixed end time point of 40&#160;h was set in order to analyse liver tissue at the peak of proliferation (Wang et&#160;al, 2008). Compared to 100% (6/6) of the young mice, only 66% (6/9) of aged mice survived up to 40&#160;h within the parameters defined by our ethical score sheet. The non&#8208;surviving aged mice recovered from surgery, but were severely strained 24&#160;h post&#8208;PH and required euthanization. The livers of euthanized mice were determined to be not regenerating and were excluded from further analysis. The proliferation index (p.i.) of the remaining six aged and six young animals was calculated by the ratio of Ki67&#8208;positive hepatocytes to total number of hepatocytes and a p.i. of &lt;&#160;10% was used as a cut&#8208;off to classify the livers as (&#8722;) non&#8208;regenerating, while a p.i. of 10 or greater signified (+) regeneration (Fig&#160;2). The livers of all young mice 6/6 were regenerating (p.i.&#160;=&#160;75&#160;&#177;&#160;10; Fig&#160;2A) vs. only 2/9 of the aged livers (p.i.&#160;=&#160;37.5 and 30.7; Fig&#160;2B). The p.i. of the remaining four aged mice scored &lt;&#160;10 (p.i.&#160;=&#160;4.2&#160;&#177;&#160;2.4; Fig&#160;2C) and therefore was classified as non&#8208;regenerating (Fig&#160;2B). Histologically, all regenerating livers showed discreet architectural changes, and young livers had slight microvascular steatosis (Fig&#160;2A), whereas aged regenerating livers had marked steatosis (Fig&#160;2B). Aged non&#8208;regenerating livers had signs of foamy degeneration of the hepatocytes and virtually no hepatic steatosis (Fig&#160;2C).</text>

      <text>Compared to young livers, aged livers had higher steady state levels of pMST that remained elevated during regeneration (Fig&#160;3A). Steady state level of pLATS was also higher in aged animals and was not modulated following PH (Appendix&#160;Fig S4). Total MST1 protein decreased 40&#160;h post&#8208;PH in young livers, but remained elevated in aged mice. No difference was observed in levels of p&#8208;YAP between young and aged animals. However, total YAP protein increased in young animals following PH, whereas in aged animals there was a higher steady state level that was not altered following PH (Fig&#160;3A). This observation was unique to YAP as TAZ expression increased in a similar manner in both young and aged animals (Fig&#160;3A). Moreover, there was no increase of YAP1 targets Foxm1B, Birc5, Ccnb1 or other regulators of cell cycle such as, Ccna2 and Ccnd1 and a tendency of higher Cdkn1A levels in non&#8208;regenerating aged animals (Fig&#160;3B). Taken together, these data support that there are age&#8208;related defects in liver regeneration following PH and regulation of the Hippo pathway is anomalous in non&#8208;regenerating aged livers.</text>

      <text>Bringing together our observations presented above with data that has shown MST1/2 are constitutively activated in a quiescent liver (Zhou et&#160;al, 2008b; Lu et&#160;al, 2010; Song et&#160;al, 2015), we chose to inhibit MST1/2 by RNAi as a potential means to improve the liver's regenerative potential. Both MST1 and MST2 were targeted due to their reported redundancy and overlapping function (Zhou et&#160;al, 2008b; Lu et&#160;al, 2010). We screened and selected siRNA sequences based on their ability to inhibit MST1 and MST2 expression in a mouse liver cell line (Appendix&#160;Fig S5). For in&#160;vivo delivery, siRNAs were encapsulated with liposomes and delivered by femoral vein (i.v.) injection. In control experiments, we confirmed that the liver and more specifically hepatocytes were targeted with lipid&#8208;encapsulated siRNA by knocking down factor VII (FVII), a coagulation protein synthesized specifically by hepatocytes. Venous injection of lipid&#8208;encapsulated siRNA targeting FVII achieved an 80% reduction of FVII mRNA in the liver and 90% reduction of circulating FVII protein (Fig&#160;EV2).</text>

      <text>In young mice, knockdown of MST1/2 with siRNA (siMST) effectively reduced hepatic expression of Mst1 &amp; Mst2 to 15 and 45%, respectively, within 24&#160;h after i.v. injection. The efficiency of the knockdown declined over time but still partially remained 6&#160;days after injection (Fig&#160;4A). Concordant with the loss of Mst1 mRNA, MST1 protein was depleted and lower levels of p&#8208;LATS1 were detected over time (Fig&#160;4B). In siMST livers, there was an increase of YAP1 and a decrease of p&#8208;YAP1 in nuclear&#8208;enriched protein extracts 3&#160;days after injection (Fig&#160;4C). The amount of nuclear proteins was normalized with histone H3, which remained constant; however, its phosphorylated form (p&#8208;H3), a marker of mitosis, was increased in siMST&#8208;injected livers (Fig&#160;4C). There was a significant up&#8208;regulation of YAP1 target genes, Birc5 (2.8&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2&#8208;fold), Foxm1B (5.3&#160;&#177;&#160;0.3&#8208;fold) and Ccnb1 (6.8&#160;&#177;&#160;0.6&#8208;fold) at day 3 and Foxm1B (5.3&#160;&#177;&#160;0.3&#8208;fold) and Ccnb1 (6.8&#160;&#177;&#160;0.6&#8208;fold) at day 6 (Fig&#160;4D). The proliferation marker, Ki67, was positive in the hepatocytes of the KD tissue, whereas the biliary epithelial cells/bile ducts were negative, favouring a hepatocytic over ductal response (Fig&#160;4E). The percentage of proliferating cells was calculated by the number of Ki67&#8208;positive cells relative to the total number of hepatocytes measured by nuclear size and HNF4&#8208;&#945; staining. siMST provoked a hepatocyte p.i. of 5.7&#160;&#177;&#160;1.2 at day 3 and 6.9&#160;&#177;&#160;1.5 at day 6 post&#8208;injection, whereas the p.i. of the scrambled controls (siScr) was 1.1&#160;&#177;&#160;0.8 (Fig&#160;4E). We observed no increase of liver&#8208;to&#8208;body weight ratio up to day 6 post&#8208;injection.</text>

      <text>For a broader view on the effect of siRNA targeting MST1/2, we used a gene expression microarray to compare the transcriptome of livers treated with siMST with siScr and untreated control livers. Few individual genes were significantly regulated between the siMST and siScr groups; however, a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) performed with the algorithm SetRank revealed several affected pathways (Appendix&#160;Fig S6). The first group of genes had known antiviral activity such as the 2&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; oligoadenylate synthetases Oas2, Oas1a, Oasl1 and Oas1g and several MHC II genes such H2&#8208;D1, H2&#8208;K1, H2&#8208;Q4 and H2&#8208;Q7 are related to interferon gamma signaling. They were up&#8208;regulated when comparing the siMST livers to both the siScr and untreated livers. Although this specific antiviral response is not observed when comparing the siScr group to untreated livers, it is still likely to constitute a reaction of the liver cells to treatment with dsRNA, as we observe a different antiviral response in the siScr livers (Appendix&#160;Fig S7A). The second group related to cell cycle, more specifically with mitotic prophase. Livers treated with siMST showed an up&#8208;regulation of several elements of the kinetochore complex such as Kif2c, Nuf2 and Ndc80, along with key cell cycle activators such as Cdk1 and Ccnb2 (Appendix&#160;Fig S7B). The third group consists of gene sets related to the extracellular matrix (EM) such as the collagen genes Col1a1, Col1a2 and Col3a1, the laminin genes Lamb1, Lamb2 and Lamc1, fibulin 5 (Fbln5), fibrin 1 (Fbn1), heparan sulphate proteoglycan 2 (Hpgn2) and lumican (Lum) (Appendix&#160;Fig S7C). The detection of gene sets involved in cell proliferation and formation of matrix suggests that transient inhibition of MST1/2 is permissive for organ growth. Finally, analysis of the serum from control or siMST&#8208;injected animals revealed no increase of alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST), suggesting that liver damage did not account for the increased hepatic proliferation (Appendix&#160;Fig S8A). In addition, there was no significant decrease of Mst1 or Mst2 mRNA expression in the lung and spleen indicating low, remote off&#8208;target effects (Appendix&#160;Fig S8B).</text>

      <text>We next tested the hypothesis that inhibition of MST1/2 could rescue an age&#8208;related defect in liver regeneration. Aged mice were injected with either siRNA targeting MST1/2 (siMST) or a scrambled control (siScr) and 24&#160;h after injection a 70% PH was performed. The resected liver tissue was used to determine the efficiency of the KD and siMST1/2 effectively knocked down hepatic expression of Mst1 &amp; Mst2 to 18 and 55%, respectively (Fig&#160;EV3). Forty hours post&#8208;PH, there was a 0% (0/9) survival rate of the aged mice injected with siScr, whereas there was 66% (6/9) survival of aged mice injected with siMST (Fig&#160;5A). The livers of siMST animals scored with a mean p.i. of 36.17&#160;&#177;&#160;11.18 (Fig&#160;5B). Ki67&#8208;positive cells were observed in the hepatocytic compartment of the livers only; there were no signs of ductal reactions or oval cell expansion as determined by H&amp;E stain, CK&#8208;19 expression and Ki67 (Fig&#160;5C). As an additional sign of regeneration, Birc5, Foxm1B and Ccnb1 were significantly up&#8208;regulated 40&#160;h post&#8208;PH in the aged siMST&#8208;treated livers (Fig&#160;5D). When comparing the regeneration of livers treated with siMST to the non&#8208;treated aged controls, knockdown of MST1/2 significantly increased the p.i. (aged: 14.2&#160;&#177;&#160;15.7 vs. siMST: 36.2&#160;&#177;&#160;11.2; Fig&#160;5E) and increased the liver&#8208;to&#8208;body weight ratio (Fig&#160;5F) demonstrating an overall advantage of targeting MST in aged animals. To verify that cellular hypertrophy was not the cause of the increased liver&#8208;to&#8208;body weight ratio, the geometric diameter of the hepatocytes was measured (Appendix&#160;Fig S9). There was an increase of hepatocyte size in regenerating livers of both young and aged animals. However, no significant change in the size of regenerating hepatocytes was found in aged compared to aged&#160;+&#160;siMST&#8208;treated animals (Fig&#160;5G). This suggests that cellular hypertrophy is not the cause of the increased liver&#8208;to&#8208;body weight ratio in the aged&#160;+&#160;siMST&#8208;treated animals, but rather an increase of hepatocyte size and number. And finally, serum ALT, AST and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels were elevated following PH, indicating liver cell injury in aged animals; however, there were no significant differences in regenerating aged mice treated or not treated with siMST (Appendix&#160;Fig S10). Taken together, using an aged mouse model, we demonstrate the clinical applicability of targeting MST1/2 to improve the liver's regenerative capacity.</text>

      <text>Our data demonstrate that the liver's physiological growth response following PH involves MST1 and LATS protein modification and YAP1 activation, which is demonstrated by its nuclear localization and transcriptional activation of target genes. YAP1 involvement in liver regeneration is in agreement with others (Wu et&#160;al, 2001; Grijalva et&#160;al, 2004); however, our data fine&#8208;tune the role of Hippo during the early hypertrophic and proliferative phases of the regenerative response. Phosphorylated MST1 and LATS1 were detected in quiescent livers; however, their phosphorylation increased at early time points after PH. Although this may appear contradictory to a proliferative response, this increase occurs during the hypertrophy phase of regeneration before the onset of hepatocyte proliferation (Miyaoka et&#160;al, 2010). As the hypertrophy phase transitions into the proliferative phase, levels of p&#8208;MST and p&#8208;LATS1 decrease coinciding with Ki67 immunostaining and YAP1 activation. We did not observe phosphorylated MST1 or LATS1 following PH to be reduced below their steady state levels, allowing us to speculate as to the importance of the flux of their expression in the control of YAP1. Moreover, one can speculate that the steady state levels of pMST and pLATS needed to maintain YAP in a quiescent liver are not sufficient to control its expression when the regenerative signals are fully engaged, as occurring following PH. The increase of p&#8208;LATS1 coincided with the increase of its upstream regulator p&#8208;MST1, which is supported by reports showing significant decrease of LATS1 phosphorylation following inactivation of MST1/2 (Lu et&#160;al, 2010). However, it was also demonstrated that MST proteins could regulate YAP1 independent of LATS1 (Zhou et&#160;al, 2008b). Therefore, although we observed a strong regulation of MST1 and LATS1 protein during liver regeneration, we cannot conclude by which mechanism YAP1 is being controlled.</text>

      <text>Several liver&#8208;specific knockout models targeting Hippo pathway proteins such as MST1/2 (Zhou et&#160;al, 2008b; Lu et&#160;al, 2010; Song et&#160;al, 2015), NF2 (Benhamouche et&#160;al, 2010; Zhang et&#160;al, 2010) and WW45 (Lee et al, 2010) have been generated. Notably, there is the target&#8208;dependent effect in the liver. A liver&#8208;specific KO of MST1/2 resulted in hepatocyte proliferation, whereas NF2 depletion mainly targeted biliary cells, and WW45 KO increased the number of hepatic progenitor cells. As hepatocyte proliferation is fundamental for liver regeneration, MST1/2 presents itself as an optimal therapeutic target. Moreover, compared to structural proteins, kinases are easier targets for potential pharmacological intervention. Until now, no data are published on the effect of a liver&#8208;specific LATS1 and 2 deletion. Recently, however, a liver&#8208;specific Lats2 single&#8208;knockout (Lats2flox/flox; Albumin&#8208;Cre, Lats2&#8208;cKO) was reported to show no overt histological abnormalities nor developed liver tumours up to 16&#160;months of age (Park et&#160;al, 2006). MST1/2 regulation of YAP1 is reported to be tissue specific, particularly in the liver (Zhou et&#160;al, 2008b). Thereby, kinases other than LATS may be responsible for YAP1 phosphorylation downstream of MST1/2, further supporting MST proteins as suitable targets.</text>

      <text>We chose to use siRNAs as the means to genetically target MST1/2. The temporary effect offered by siRNA is attractive in order to minimize the chance that inhibition of Hippo signaling could provoke liver overgrowth or hepatocyte transformation. Using siRNA coupled with liposomes has the advantage of reaching our target cell the hepatocyte with higher specificity, thereby reducing the effect of YAP1 activation in other cell types. The liposomes used in this study successfully reached the hepatocyte and delivered the siRNA in a sufficient concentration to knock down our targeted genes of interest. In young mice, this appeared to be achieved in the absence of any additional stress/injury to the liver, as we did not observe an increase of serum transaminase. Also, mice injected with control siRNA to a scrambled sequence showed no significant signs of proliferation. However, the poor recovery following PH of aged animals receiving encapsulated control siRNA suggests that the liver is stressed; however, this effect is most likely due to the liposome delivery, as the siRNA targeting MST1/2 improved regeneration, even compensating for the delivery system. Specific targeting of MST1 or 2 should not result in liver injury as serum transaminases are not elevated in MST1/2 double mutants (Lu et&#160;al, 2010).</text>

      <text>Targeting MST1/2 with encapsulated liposomes reduced MST1/2 mRNA and MST1 protein, induced YAP1 activation and provoked hepatocytes to re&#8208;enter cell cycle. YAP1 targets genes involved in cell proliferation were increased, whereas CTGF was not increased in mouse (Appendix&#160;Fig S3) or rat (Grijalva et&#160;al, 2004) liver following PH. Targeting MST1/2 with siRNA did result in a mild phenotype, which may be viewed as a desired effect to avoid detrimental side effects of inhibiting Hippo in the liver, or overexpressing YAP1 directly, such as hepatocyte overproliferation or de&#8208;differentiation (Yimlamai et&#160;al, 1999). While our manuscript was under review, a study reported siRNA nanoparticles targeting MST1, MST and Nf2 results in extensive proliferation of hepatocytes and activation of YAP1 (Yin et al, 2014). In their model, hepatomegaly was only observed in the triple knockdown, 15&#160;days following repeated injections. This in part explains the mild phenotype we observed in quiescent liver targeting only MST1 and MST2 after 6&#160;days with a single siRNA injection and advocates optimization of treatment protocols. Nevertheless, both studies support the Hippo pathway as a viable therapeutic target to manipulate liver growth.</text>

      <text>By restoring regeneration in an aged mouse model, we were able to demonstrate the potential clinical applicability of targeting the Hippo pathway. Several groups have reported aged&#8208;related defects in liver regeneration (Bucher et&#160;al, 2010; Fry et&#160;al, 2015; Wang et&#160;al, 2001; Pibiri et&#160;al, 2007) and YAP1 activation was suggested to help aged mice recover after PH (Pibiri et&#160;al, 2007). The beneficial effect we observed with siMST could be a result of a direct activation of YAP1 in the targeted hepatocytes. Foxm1B expression is restricted to proliferating cells and strongly up&#8208;regulated upon entry into the S phase of cell cycle (Korver et&#160;al, 2003) and was increased in liver injected with siMST. In a report by Wang et&#160;al, mice with sustained hepatic Foxm1B overexpression were able to overcome age&#8208;related defects during liver regeneration; however, Foxm1B alone is insufficient to induce differentiated cells to enter cell cycle (Ye et&#160;al, 1995; Wang et&#160;al, 2001). Birc5 and Ccnb1 were also increased by MST1/2 RNAi. However, as MST1 is involved in other signaling pathways including apoptotic signaling (Ardestani et&#160;al, 2014; Del Re et&#160;al, 2005; Chao et&#160;al, 2007), it is not conclusive whether the effect we achieve is due only to YAP1 activation. This question is prompted by our observations in the aged mice, in which siMST&#8208;treated animals showed a survival advantage at 24&#160;h compared to the siScr control, a time point prior to the actual proliferative phase of the regenerative response.</text>

      <text>The Hippo pathway is becoming an attractive target in the liver for therapeutic intervention in the field of hepatic malignancies (Fitamant et&#160;al, 2009; Yimlamai et&#160;al, 1999) and hepatic re&#8208;growth (Yin et al, 2014). As Hippo is also important for tissue stem cell maintenance (Lu et&#160;al, 2010), these implications may reach beyond the liver and to the repair and regeneration of other organs. Research and development of small molecule kinase inhibitors that modulate the activation of Hippo kinases or antisense drugs to silence expression of key regulatory proteins hold promising therapeutic and investigative potential in regenerative medicine.</text>

      <text>The mice used in this study were 6&#8208; to 8&#8208;week&#8208; (~20&#160;g) and 12&#8208;month&#8208;old (~29&#160;g) female C57BL/6JRccHsd provided by Harlan, the Netherlands. Animals were kept in a temperature&#8208;controlled room with a 12&#8208;h dark/light cycle. Experiments were done with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approval and in strict accord with good animal practice as defined by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare. Littermates were randomly assigned to control sham or partial hepatectomy groups. Mice were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation during an operation time of 15&#8211;20&#160;min. For analgesia, Temgesic (0.05&#160;mg/kg) was injected i.p. prior to surgery. Two&#8208;thirds partial hepatectomy (2/3 or 70%) was performed according to methods previously described (Inderbitzin et&#160;al, 2003). Briefly, following a laparotomy, vicryl 4.0 suture (VCP496, Ethicon) was used to ligate and excise the median and left liver lobes. The peritoneal cavity was washed with saline solution and the abdomen was sutured closed. In sham&#8208;operated mice, a laparotomy was performed, the liver was manipulated with a cotton&#8208;coated stick, flushed with saline, and the abdomen was sutured closed. The resected tissue was collected and used as a non&#8208;regenerating matched control for each mouse. Liver tissue from non&#8208;operated and sham&#8208;operated mice was also used as controls. Liver regeneration was followed for various time points up to 6&#160;days. At experimental endpoints, mice were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation. Blood was collected via the vena cava and centrifuged for serum. Mice were sacrificed by exsanguination. All excised tissues were cut in 3&#160;&#215;&#160;3&#160;mm pieces, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#8722;80&#176;C or fixed in 4% formalin overnight at room temperature.</text>

      <text>The output of limma was used to perform GSEA using the SetRank method (C. Simillion, R. Liechti, H. Lischer, V. Ioannidis &amp; R. Bruggman, submitted). The key principle of this algorithm is that it discards gene sets that have initially been flagged as significant, if their significance is only due to the overlap with another gene set. It calculates the P&#8208;value of a gene set using the ranking of its genes in the ordered list of P&#8208;values as calculated by limma. The following databases were searched for significant gene sets: BIOCYC (Karp et&#160;al, 2014), Gene Ontology (Ashburner et&#160;al, 2000), ITFP (Zheng et&#160;al, 2010), KEGG (Kanehisa et&#160;al, 2000), LIPID MAPS (Fahy et&#160;al, 2006), PhosphoSitePlus (Hornbeck et&#160;al, 2005), REACTOME (Croft et&#160;al, 2005) and WikiPathways (Kelder et&#160;al, 2005).</text>

      <text>The regenerative capacity of diseased and aged livers is impaired which increases the risk of liver failure following surgical resections. The Hippo pathway controls organ growth by kinase inactivation of the pro&#8208;proliferative transcriptional co&#8208;activator YAP1.</text>

      <text>In this study, we demonstrate that proteins in the Hippo pathway are differentially expressed in young vs. aged mice that are dynamically regulated during liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy. By silencing the MST core kinases, we were able to induce pro&#8208;proliferative YAP activity and rescue regeneration in an aged mouse model.</text>
