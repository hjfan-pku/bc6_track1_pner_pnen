      <text>Hippo signaling controls organ size by regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP) is a key downstream effector of Hippo signaling, and LATS&#8208;mediated phosphorylation of YAP at Ser127 inhibits its nuclear localization and transcriptional activity. Here, we report that Nemo&#8208;like kinase (NLK) phosphorylates YAP at Ser128 both in vitro and in vivo, which blocks interaction with 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 and enhances its nuclear localization. Depletion of NLK increases YAP phosphorylation at Ser127 and reduces YAP&#8208;mediated reporter activity. These results suggest that YAP phosphorylation at Ser128 and at Ser127 may be mutually exclusive. We also find that with the increase in cell density, nuclear localization and the level of NLK are reduced, resulting in reduction in YAP phosphorylation at Ser128. Furthermore, knockdown of Nemo (the Drosophila NLK) in fruit fly wing imaginal discs results in reduced expression of the Yorkie (the Drosophila YAP) target genes expanded and DIAP1, while Nemo overexpression reciprocally increased the expression. Overall, our data suggest that NLK/Nemo acts as an endogenous regulator of Hippo signaling by controlling nuclear localization and activity of YAP/Yorkie.</text>

      <text>Precise control of the organ size is crucial during animal development and tissue regeneration. Therefore, the size&#8208;control mechanisms of tissue homeostasis have become a long&#8208;standing topic of interest. As loss of the organ size control is linked to many human diseases, including cancer and degenerative diseases, regulation of the organ size could be an attractive therapeutic strategy. Recently, Hippo signaling has been identified as a major signaling pathway to control the organ size; dysregulation of this pathway results in aberrant growth 1.</text>

      <text>The Hippo pathway is evolutionarily conserved from nematodes to humans and controls a variety of cellular processes, such as cell proliferation and apoptosis, culminating in the organ size regulation 2. This signaling pathway was originally discovered via genetic screening in Drosophila to identify genes involved in the regulation of the organ size. Hippo, Warts, Salvador, and Yorkie are core components of the pathway which, when mutated, result in dramatic overgrowth of mutant tissues 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. In addition, a number of novel regulatory components in the Hippo pathway have emerged 3, 8, 9. In mammals, the Hippo pathway consists of the serine/threonine kinases MST1/2 (mammalian Ste20&#8208;like kinase, Hippo orthologs) and LATS1/2 (large tumor suppressor kinase, Warts orthologs), the scaffolding protein WW45 (Salvador ortholog), a transcriptional co&#8208;activator YAP (Yes&#8208;associated protein, Yorkie ortholog) and its paralogue TAZ (known as WWTR1) 10. Activation of the Hippo signaling by extracellular stimuli, mechanical sensation, or cell density promotes cytoplasmic retention of YAP/TAZ via interaction with 14&#8208;3&#8208;3, followed by &#946;&#8208;TrCP&#8208;mediated proteasomal degradation of YAP/TAZ 11, 12, 13. These processes depend on LATS1/2&#8208;mediated direct phosphorylation at different sites of YAP 11, 14. YAP phosphorylation on S127 is essential to associate with 14&#8208;3&#8208;3, while phosphorylation on S397 by LATS1/2 creates a phospho&#8208;degron motif for &#946;&#8208;TrCP binding 12. Conversely, dephosphorylated YAP/TAZ functions through the TEAD family transcriptional factors in the nucleus to activate genes involved in cell proliferation and tissue overgrowth 15. Therefore, YAP/TAZ phosphorylation by LATS1/2 has been accepted as a critical process that regulates YAP/TAZ transcriptional activity.</text>

      <text>Nemo&#8208;like kinase (NLK) belongs to the atypical MAP&#8208;kinase family and participates in a variety of biological responses, including cell motility and embryogenesis 16, 17. NLK is thought to act as a proline (P)&#8208;directed serine/threonine kinase 16. As several transcriptional regulators have been identified as NLK substrates, NLK is known to play crucial regulatory roles in diverse signaling pathways, including Wnt/&#946;&#8208;catenin, Notch, FOXO, and mTOR signaling 18, 19, 20, 21. However, the functional interaction between NLK and Hippo&#8208;YAP signaling has been unknown.</text>

      <text>Here, we show that NLK phosphorylates YAP at Ser128, which leads to reduction in LATS&#8208;mediated phosphorylation at Ser127. NLK thus promotes YAP nuclear localization and transcriptional activity via dissociation from 14&#8208;3&#8208;3. The level of YAP phosphorylation at Ser128, as well as the nuclear localization and overall NLK levels, becomes decreased upon augmentation of the cell density. Consistently, we further show that knockdown of NLK in Drosophila reduces expression of YAP target genes in imaginal discs. Overall, our data suggest that NLK&#8208;mediated YAP phosphorylation is a bona fide mechanism for regulation of YAP activity in vivo.</text>

      <text>Previous reports have shown that NLK is involved in a variety of signaling pathways, including Wnt, Notch, Foxo, and mTOR signaling. This prompted us to examine whether NLK is able to regulate Hippo signaling. To this end, we overexpressed core components of the Hippo pathway with or without NLK and examined mobility shifts, which might be induced by NLK&#8208;mediated phosphorylation. As shown in Fig EV1A, NLK led to a strong mobility shift of YAP but not other components such as MST1, WW45, and TEAD1. Meanwhile, overexpression of two forms of kinase&#8208;negative NLK constructs (K155M, later on referred as &#8220;KM&#8221;, and T286V, later on referred as &#8220;TV&#8221;) 16 did not induce a mobility shift for YAP, indicating the kinase activity of NLK was required for the mobility shift of YAP (Figs 1A and EV1B). Elimination of the mobility shift by treatment with &#955;&#8208;phosphatase as well as an in vitro kinase assay further confirmed that YAP was phosphorylated directly by NLK (Figs EV1C and 1B). In line with these findings, we observed that both endogenous and exogenous NLK interacted with YAP, and the two kinase&#8208;negative forms of NLK interacted with YAP much more strongly than the wild type did (Figs 1C and EV1D). Taken together, these results suggest that NLK interacts with and directly phosphorylates YAP, and this phosphorylation in turn may regulate binding of NLK and its substrate.</text>

      <text>YAP is evolutionarily conserved from nematodes to flies and to mammals, and phosphorylation of YAP at Ser127 (corresponding to human YAP) by serine/threonine kinase LATS1/2 is an important step for regulation of nuclear/cytoplasmic localization and stability (Fig 2A). Interestingly, YAP contains a highly conserved SP motif, a putative NLK phosphorylation site 22, immediately adjacent to Ser127 (Fig 2A). To examine whether NLK is involved in YAP phosphorylation at Ser128, HA&#8208;YAP was transiently transfected into HEK293T cells along with either Flag&#8208;NLK&#8208;WT or Flag&#8208;NLK&#8208;KM and then HA&#8208;YAP was immunoprecipitated with the anti&#8208;HA antibody. LC&#8211;MS/MS analysis revealed phospho&#8208;peaks of YAP at Ser128 when Flag&#8208;NLK&#8208;WT was transfected and phospho&#8208;peaks of YAP at Ser127 when Flag&#8208;NLK&#8208;KM was transfected (Fig EV2). This finding prompted us to explore whether or not NLK affects YAP phosphorylation at Ser127. As shown in Fig 2B, endogenous phosphorylation of YAP at Ser127 was reduced by NLK&#8208;WT but not by the NLK&#8208;KM. Interestingly, YAP phosphorylation at Ser397, another LATS1/2 consensus site in YAP that creates a phospho&#8208;degron motif for &#946;&#8208;TrCP binding, was also reduced when NLK was overexpressed (Fig 2B). Next, we used lithium chloride (LiCl), previously used as an inhibitor of NLK and GSK3&#946; activities 23, 24, to further test whether NLK has a negative effect on YAP phosphorylation at Ser127. LiCl augmented YAP phosphorylation at Ser127 when compared to KCl (Fig EV3A). On the other hand, both the GSK3&#946;&#8208;specific inhibitor BIO (Fig EV3A) and knockdown of GSK3&#946; had no effect on YAP phosphorylation at Ser127 (Fig EV3B). These data suggest that LiCl&#8208;mediated induction of YAP phosphorylation at Ser127 was due to inhibition of NLK. To further show that NLK regulates YAP phosphorylation at Ser127 and Ser397, we used the CRSPR/Cas9 system to assess loss&#8208;of&#8208;function effects of NLK on YAP phosphorylation. Transient transfection of two different gRNA sequences targeting NLK with Cas9 resulted in an efficient ablation of NLK (Fig 2C). Consistent with above results, the levels of phosphorylation at Ser127/397 were significantly increased in the NLK KO cell pool (Fig 2C).</text>

      <text>To further confirm phosphorylation of YAP at Ser128 by NLK, we generated antibody against the phosphorylated YAP&#8208;S128 peptide and confirmed its specificity as determined by no positive signal detected upon expression of YAP&#8208;S128A unlike wild&#8208;type YAP (Fig EV3C). Marked increase in endogenous YAP phosphorylation at Ser128 by NLK&#8208;WT, but not NLK&#8208;KM, was observed (Fig EV3D). Also, increased YAP phosphorylation at Ser128 by ectopic expression of NLK was significantly blocked by the treatment of LiCl but not KCl (Fig EV3E). To further test whether NLK phosphorylates YAP&#8208;S128, in vitro kinase assay was performed. Phosphorylation at S128 of GST&#8208;YAP, but not GST&#8208;YAP&#8208;S128A, was induced by immunoprecipitated Flag&#8208;NLK, but not NLK&#8208;KM (Fig EV3F). Overall, these data suggest that our antibody is specific to pYAP&#8208;Ser128 that is phosphorylated by NLK.</text>

      <text>Interestingly, increased phosphorylation of Ser128 by NLK showed a reverse correlation with the phosphorylation at Ser127 (Fig 2D). Phosphorylation at Ser128 was elevated in the YAP&#8208;S127A mutant, whereas the YAP&#8208;S128A mutant exhibited increased phosphorylation at Ser127 when compared to wild&#8208;type YAP (Fig 2E). To further test whether the phosphorylation of S128 by NLK inhibits phosphorylation of YAP&#8208;S127 by LATS1, in vitro kinase assay was performed. As shown in Fig EV3G, the phosphorylation at Ser127 of GST&#8208;YAP and GST&#8208;YAP&#8208;S128A by immunoprecipitated Flag&#8208;LATS1 was highly efficient, while phosphorylation at Ser127 of GST&#8208;YAP&#8208;S128D was strongly suppressed (Fig EV3G). Together with LC&#8211;MS analysis, which did not reveal a concomitant YAP phosphorylation on S127 and S128 (Fig EV2), these results suggest that phosphorylations of Ser127 and Ser128 of YAP may be mutually exclusive.</text>

      <text>It has been well known that phosphorylation of YAP at Ser127 by LATS1/2 induces cytoplasmic retention of YAP through its interaction with 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 11. We showed that NLK increased YAP phosphorylation at Ser128 along with reduced phosphorylation at Ser127 (Fig 2D). Thus, we examined whether or not YAP phosphorylation at Ser128 by NLK affects the interaction between YAP and 14&#8208;3&#8208;3. Overexpression of NLK&#8208;WT, but not NLK&#8208;KM, completely blocked the interaction between YAP and 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 (Fig 3A). Consistently, NLK KO cells displayed stronger interaction between YAP and 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 compared with normal cells (Fig 3B). To further confirm this, we utilized the YAP mutants S127A, S128A, and S128D (a phosphorylation mimetic form) (Fig 3C). Consistent with the above findings (Figs 2E and 3A and B), YAP&#8208;S128A showed a much stronger interaction with 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 than YAP&#8208;WT did, whereas neither YAP&#8208;S127A nor YAP&#8208;S128D showed binding to 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 (Fig 3C).</text>

      <text>Since interaction with 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 leads to cytoplasmic sequestration of YAP, we next explored whether or not NLK induces nuclear localization of YAP. Overexpression of NLK&#8208;WT, but not NLK&#8208;KM, strongly induced nuclear localization of EGFP&#8208;YAP (Fig EV4A). Consistently, the results from immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation analysis clearly showed that YAP&#8208;S128A mutant localized to the cytoplasm while the phospho&#8208;mimetic YAP&#8208;S128D mutant was mainly present in the nucleus, which was similar to YAP&#8208;S127A (Figs 3D and EV4B and C). Also, normal cells exhibited strong nuclear localization of YAP at low density, but the NLK KO cell pool exhibited reduced nuclear YAP level (Fig EV4D) along with enhanced cytoplasmic localization of YAP (Fig 3E). Overall, these results indicate that NLK&#8208;mediated phosphorylation at Ser128 leads to nuclear localization of YAP by disrupting the interaction between YAP and 14&#8208;3&#8208;3.</text>

      <text>Recent studies have suggested that NLK is present in the nucleus or cytoplasm, and dimerization of NLK induced by growth factors is essential for its nuclear localization and functional activation 25. Because NLK regulates YAP localization (Figs 3 and EV4) and nuclear localization of YAP is influenced by cell confluency 11, we investigated whether or not nuclear localization of NLK is changed by cell density. NLK mainly localized to nuclei of cells at low density, whereas it was redistributed in the cytoplasm at high cell density of MCF10A and NIH3T3 cells (Fig 4A). Interestingly, the protein level of NLK, but not its mRNA expression, decreased along with increasing cell density (Fig 4B and C). Consistently, the phosphorylation of endogenous YAP at Ser128 was severely reduced in cells at high cell density, concomitant with increased YAP phosphorylation at Ser127 and Ser397 (Fig 4B). These data indicate that localization as well as protein level of NLK is controlled in a cell density&#8208;dependent manner, which affects the status of phosphorylation and cytoplasmic localization of YAP.</text>

      <text>YAP interacts with TEAD and induces expression of genes involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, anti&#8208;apoptosis, and cell migration 15. Therefore, we next investigated whether or not NLK controls transcriptional activity of YAP. Knockout of NLK severely reduced the interaction between YAP and TEAD (Fig 5A). Consistently, reporter activities using a luciferase construct driven by 8x&#8208;GTIIC promoter 13 were significantly reduced when NLK was knocked down (Fig EV5A). Real&#8208;time PCR analysis revealed that the levels of endogenous CTGF and ANKRD1 mRNA, well&#8208;known YAP/TEAD target genes 13, 15, were significantly reduced by knockdown of NLK (Fig EV5B). To investigate the role of NLK in regulation of the transcriptional activity of YAP in vivo, we tested the effects of manipulation of Nemo (Drosophila NLK) levels during fruit fly wing development on Yorkie (Drosophila YAP) target gene expression. Normal expression of expanded, as can be seen in the anterior, anti&#8208;Ci marked control regions of the Drosophila wing imaginal discs (Figs EV5C and 5D), is low within the wing pouch and high at the wing pouch periphery 26. Nemo overproduction leads to dramatic upregulation of expanded within the wing pouch, quantified in Fig EV5C. In contrast, Nemo downregulation reduces the peripheral expression of this target (high magnifications in Fig EV5D). To test whether Nemo downregulation could suppress another Yorkie target gene, whose expression would be more uniform across the wing pouch area, we performed immunostaining against the Yorkie target DIAP17, which reveals a salt&#8208;and&#8208;pepper expression pattern within the wing pouch area 27. This analysis reveals that Nemo downregulation strongly suppressed DIAP1 throughout the RNAi&#8208;expressed posterior domain (Fig 5C). Finally, we wished to test the epistasis between Nemo and Yorkie. For this aim, we co&#8208;expressed the nemo&#8208;targeting RNAi and a Hippo insensitive mutant form of Yorkie (yki[S168A]) in the posterior compartment. The resulting discs display typical yki[S168A] phenotype 28 of massive posterior overgrowth and increase in the Yorkie target gene expression (Fig 5D), indistinguishable from discs expressing yki[S168A] alone. This observation indicates that Yorkie is epistatic to Nemo in Drosophila.</text>

      <text>Since YAP enhances cell migration and proliferation 29, we tested whether NLK regulates cell migration. Knockdown of NLK significantly reduced cell migration, which depends on YAP because its expression rescued this defect (Fig EV5E). We further tested the effect of NLK on YAP&#8208;dependent wound healing as a measure of cell proliferation and migration. Wound healing ability was affected by the phosphorylation status of Ser127 or Ser128. Ectopic expression of YAP&#8208;S127A and the phosphorylated mimetic form of YAP at Ser128 (YAP&#8208;S128D) in wild&#8208;type cells or NLK KO pool cells showed enhanced wound healing ability compared to cells expressing YAP&#8208;WT, whereas the S128A mutation produced the opposite effect (Figs 5E and EV5F). Overall, these findings demonstrate that NLK positively regulates YAP activity in physiological settings.</text>

      <text>YAP has oncogenic properties and mainly functions as a downstream effector of the Hippo pathway 30. LATS1/2 phosphorylates YAP at five serine/threonine residues, and phosphorylation of these sites acts as a fundamental input for YAP regulation 11. Of these phosphorylation sites, Ser127 and S397 are the most functional residues regulating YAP activity. Phosphorylation at Ser127 by LATS1/2 creates a binding consensus site for 14&#8208;3&#8208;3, resulting in cytoplasmic retention, while phosphorylation on S397 induces &#946;&#8208;TrCP&#8208;mediated proteasomal degradation of YAP. In addition to LATS1/2 kinases, Akt is also reported to phosphorylate YAP at serine 127, thereby leading to association 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 and regulating apoptosis following the cellular damage 31. More recently, NDR1/2 kinases were identified as YAP&#8208;S127 kinases and might function as tumor suppressors upstream of YAP in colon cancer 32. Conversely, YAP phosphorylation can be reversed by phosphatase, leading to YAP reactivation. Regarding the physiological importance of YAP&#8208;S127 phosphorylation, one interesting study has addressed it by introducing a Yap&#8208;S112A (corresponding site for the human homologue in mouse) knock&#8208;in mutation in the endogenous Yap locus. Surprisingly, although nuclear localization of Yap protein was observed in tissues and cultured cells harboring mutant Yap&#8208;S112A, knock&#8208;in mice were phenotypically normal probably due to compensatory decrease in YAP protein levels 33. These findings suggest a homeostatic regulation that maintains physiological YAP activity by yet unidentified mechanisms.</text>

      <text>In addition to serine phosphorylation, phosphorylation of YAP at tyrosine residues by Src or c&#8208;Abl kinase modulates YAP transcriptional activity 34, 35. Tyrosine phosphatase PTPN14 is able to inhibit YAP transcriptional activity by inducing cell density&#8208;dependent translocation of YAP from the nucleus to cytoplasm 36. A more recent report showed that monomethylation of YAP at K494 by Set7, a SET domain&#8208;containing lysine (K) methyltransferase, promotes cytoplasmic retention and inhibition of YAP&#8208;dependent growth 37. Taken together, these observations suggest that control of YAP subcellular localization is the sum of multiple regulatory layers and is critical for transactivation. Thus, identifying the molecular regulatory mechanisms of YAP localization will be important to fully understand how the organ size and occurrence of tumors are controlled.</text>

      <text>NLK regulates activities of several transcription factors, including TCF/LEF1, NICD, and FOXO, which are key players in diverse signaling pathways 18, 19, 20. Consistently, NLK knockout mice show varying degrees of morphological abnormalities, such as growth retardation, neurological abnormalities, and hematopoietic defects 38. Here, we identified NLK as a novel kinase for YAP. Our results show that NLK phosphorylates Ser128 of YAP and plays a crucial role in regulating YAP localization and activation. The phospho&#8208;mimetic form of YAP&#8208;S128 showed strong nuclear localization and led to enhanced wound healing ability, whereas substitution of Ser128 with alanine showed the opposite effects. NLK depletion led to significant reduction in the YAP&#8208;dependent reporter activity. In the accompanying paper, Dr. Guan and colleagues report similar findings that NLK mediates YAP phosphorylation at Ser128 and nuclear localization by inhibiting association with 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 upon osmotic stress 39. Together with their results, our findings suggest that NLK is required for YAP nuclear localization and transcriptional activity in various cellular processes.</text>

      <text>We expanded the role of NLK in the regulation of YAP activity in vivo. Knockdown of Nemo (Drosophila NLK) in the fruit fly wing imaginal discs reduced expression of the Yorkie (Drosophila YAP) target genes expanded and DIAP1, while Nemo overproduction produced the opposite effect. The localization of NLK was changed from nuclei to cytoplasm, and the level was reduced along with increasing cell density. It has been shown that dimerization and nuclear localization of NLK are necessary for its activity 25. Further work is required to explore how the cell density affects NLK nuclear localization and level. It is possible that regulation of subcellular localization and level of NLK at different cell densities could be another mechanism to secure YAP localization and regulation of its transcriptional activity; nuclear NLK phosphorylates Ser128 of YAP and prevents phosphorylation of Ser127/Ser397 by LATS1/2, which allows YAP to act as a transcriptional activator in nuclei of low&#8208;density cells.</text>

      <text>Using phospho&#8208;specific antibody and in vitro kinase assay, we observed that NLK phosphorylated YAP at Ser128, which is adjacent to the LATS1/2&#8208;mediated phosphorylation site Ser127. More importantly, LATS1/2&#8208;mediated phosphorylation at Ser127/Ser397 was inhibited by YAP phosphorylation at Ser128. As shown in Fig 2A, Ser128 is evolutionarily conserved from fruit flies to humans. A previous report examined potential phosphorylation sites within Drosophila Yorkie and observed reduced phosphorylation at Ser168, corresponding to Ser127 of human YAP, in a double&#8208;mutant harboring S169D and S172D 28. This study suggested that phosphorylation at Ser169/Ser172 could reduce Ser168 phosphorylation, thereby promoting Yorkie activity. However, they did not identify endogenous kinase(s) responsible for phosphorylation at Ser169 and Ser172. Although it is unclear whether or not NLK affects phosphorylation at Ser131 (Ser172 of Drosophila Yorkie), our findings provide strong evidence that NLK is an endogenous kinase for phosphorylation at Ser128 that promotes YAP nuclear localization and transcriptional activity. Therefore, we speculate that NLK and LATS1/2 might compete for adjacent phosphorylation residues. Currently, we do not know how the phosphorylation of Ser397 is regulated by NLK, but we think that decrease in phosphorylation on S397 might be due to enhanced nuclear localization of YAP by NLK (Figs 3D and E, and EV4A), which sequesters YAP from phosphorylation by LATS1/2. Overall, our study uncovers a previously unknown kinase involved in regulation of YAP activity and sheds new light on the evolutionarily conserved regulatory mechanism of the Hippo signaling pathway.</text>

      <text>HeLa cells (3 &#215; 104 cells) were plated in the upper chamber of cell culture inserts (SPL, 8&#8208;&#956;m membrane pore size) with serum&#8208;free media. Cell growth medium containing 5% serum was added to the lower well. After 24&#8208;h incubation, cells were fixed for 2 min in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS and then permeabilized for 20 min with 100% methanol at room temperature. After removal of non&#8208;migratory cells, migrated cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet. Migrated cells were counted using an inverted microscope, and the values for histogram were calculated using ImageJ software.</text>

      <text>HEK293 and NLK KO pool cells were transfected with control or YAP mutants in 24&#8208;well plates and cultured until full confluency. Cells were scratched by 200&#8208;&#956;l pipette tip and then washed with media to remove cell debris, and the media was replaced. Photographs of the wound region were taken at 0 and 24 h. Cell free area was measured using TScratch software 40.</text>

      <text>Analysis of the effects of manipulations of Nemo levels on Yorkie target gene expression was performed following 41, whereas the posterior&#8208;specific hedgehog&#8208;Gal4 (hh&#8208;Gal4) or engailed&#8208;Gal4 (en&#8208;Gal4) drivers were used to induce overexpression or downregulation of nemo using the UAS&#8208;nmo17 or UAS&#8208;nmo&#8208;RNAi lines (104885KK or 3002GD 42), respectively. UAS&#8208;yki[S168A] was used as described 28. In third instar larval wing imaginal discs, these posterior&#8208;specific manipulations were compared to the unaffected anterior halves of the discs, which served as internal controls. expanded&#8208;LacZ43 and DIAP1 were used to monitor Yorkie target gene expression. Mouse anti&#8208;DIAP1 27, and anti&#8208;Ci, anti&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal, and anti&#8208;Hh antibodies were used as described 41. Quantification of fluorescent intensity after confocal microscopy was performed with ImageJ.</text>

      <text>All data analysis in this study was carried out using GraphPad Prism7 (San Diego, CA, http://www.graphpad.com) for Mac OS. Quantifications were done from at least three independent experiment groups. Statistical analysis between groups was assessed by two&#8208;tailed Student's t&#8208;test to determine significance. P&#8208;values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. Error bars on all graphs are presented as standard error of the mean (SEM) unless otherwise indicated.</text>
