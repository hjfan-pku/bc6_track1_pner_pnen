      <text>Functional variability among human clones of induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) remains a limitation in assembling high&#8208;quality biorepositories. Beyond inter&#8208;person variability, the root cause of intra&#8208;person variability remains unknown. Mitochondria guide the required transition from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism in nuclear reprogramming. Moreover, mitochondria have their own genome (mitochondrial DNA [mtDNA]). Herein, we performed mtDNA next&#8208;generation sequencing (NGS) on 84 hiPSC clones derived from a cohort of 19 individuals, including mitochondrial and non&#8208;mitochondrial patients. The analysis of mtDNA variants showed that low levels of potentially pathogenic mutations in the original fibroblasts are revealed through nuclear reprogramming, generating mutant hiPSCs with a detrimental effect in their differentiated progeny. Specifically, hiPSC&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes with expanded mtDNA mutations non&#8208;related with any described human disease, showed impaired mitochondrial respiration, being a potential cause of intra&#8208;person hiPSC variability. We propose mtDNA NGS as a new selection criterion to ensure hiPSC quality for drug discovery and regenerative medicine.</text>

      <text>Since their discovery in 2007, human&#8208;induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have become recognized as powerful tools for modeling disease process in basic research and in drug discovery and form the basis for new regenerative therapies (Takahashi et&#160;al, 2007; Yu et&#160;al, 2007). The functional variability among hiPSC clones is one of the primary challenges with regard to assembling high&#8208;quality hiPSC biorepositories for application in regenerative medicine and drug discovery platforms (Silva et&#160;al, 2015). Genetic and epigenetic variability among individuals is recognized as contributing to variability among hiPSCs generated from different individuals (inter&#8208;person variability) (Liang &amp; Zhang, 2013; Mills et&#160;al, 2013). However, mechanisms underlying variability observed in hiPSCs generated from the same individual (intra&#8208;person variability) remain largely undefined, despite the well&#8208;documented functional consequences resulting from intra&#8208;person variability concerning differentiation potential and gene expression (Narsinh et&#160;al, 2011; Cahan &amp; Daley, 2013).</text>

      <text>Mitochondria play a major role in energy production via the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS). Beyond providing energy, mitochondria play an important role during nuclear reprogramming, guiding the transition from somatic oxidative bioenergetics to pluripotent glycolytic metabolism (Folmes et&#160;al, 2011). Moreover, metabolic plasticity controls different stem cell fates, which include quiescence, self&#8208;renewal, and lineage specification for tissue regeneration (Folmes et&#160;al, 2012). Human mitochondria have their own genome, called mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), a small 16.6&#8208;kb circular DNA containing 37 genes: 13 protein&#8208;coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), and 22 tRNAs used for translation of those 13 polypeptides. Because of the role of mitochondria in nuclear reprogramming, we considered that there was a need to examine mtDNA as a potential source of hiPSC intra&#8208;person variability.</text>

      <text>The coexistence of multiple variants of mtDNA in a cell or tissue is referred to as heteroplasmy. While healthy somatic mammalian cells are fundamentally homoplasmic, it has recently been shown that they are heteroplasmic and harbor mtDNA variants, albeit at extremely low levels (Payne et&#160;al, 2013). Often called the universal heteroplasmy of human mtDNA, these subtle changes in mtDNA are likely due to either inherited or somatic single base substitutions. However, high heteroplasmy levels (or at least heteroplasmy levels necessary to reveal clinical phenotypes) of pathogenic mtDNA mutations are found not only in mitochondrial disease patients, but also occur in some tumors, in neurodegenerative diseases and diabetes, and are also associated with normal aging (Schon et&#160;al, 2012; Wallace, 2013).</text>

      <text>Segregation of mtDNA during nuclear reprogramming of cells from patients with mtDNA&#8208;based diseases has been proposed to result from two distinct mechanisms: (i) the original mosaicism present in the starting dermal fibroblasts (Cherry et&#160;al, 2013; Folmes et&#160;al, 2013; Ma et&#160;al, 2015), resulting in a broad distribution in the mitochondrial heteroplasmy of the disease&#8208;causing point mutation; and (ii) segregation through an embryonic bottleneck, yielding two populations, one enriched in wild&#8208;type (WT) mtDNAs, and the other enriched in mutated mtDNAs (Hamalainen et&#160;al, 2013). At present, it has been difficult to distinguish between these two mechanistic possibilities.</text>

      <text>As described herein, we performed whole mtDNA next&#8208;generation sequencing (NGS) on 84 hiPSC clones derived from a cohort of 19 individuals distributed in mitochondrial and non&#8208;mitochondrial patients. The analysis of mtDNA variants showed that a low level of heteroplasmic variance in mtDNA, without any obvious phenotypic effect on the parental tissue, is revealed during nuclear reprogramming, generating hiPSC clones with high levels of mtDNA heteroplasmy, including enrichment of mutations potentially detrimental to the differentiated progeny.</text>

      <text>We therefore propose that mtDNA NGS be used as a release criterion in the selection process of hiPSC clones. Analysis of mtDNA NGS data using HaploGrep software, focusing on the analysis of global private mutations (GPMs: mtDNA variants that do not belong to the sample haplogroup or to any other haplogroup), is able to identify clones harboring potentially damaging mutations.</text>

      <text>We analyzed the heteroplasmy levels at mtDNA position 3243 in a total of 82 hiPSC clones at passage two that were derived from three unrelated patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke&#8208;like episodes (MELAS), all of whom harbored the m.3243A&gt;G mutation in the MT&#8208;TL1 gene specifying tRNALeu(UUR) (Goto et&#160;al, 1990). PCR&#8208;RFLP analyses showed an inter&#8208;person variability of this point mutation in the reprogrammed pluripotent state (Fig&#160;1A). hiPSCs derived from two MELAS patients (MitoA, MitoB) displayed a broad distribution of heteroplasmy levels of the m.3243A&gt;G mutation, ranging from 100% wild type to 100% mutant (Fig&#160;1A). However, hiPSC clones derived from the third MELAS patient (MitoC) exhibited a median level of mutation approaching 80%, with only a single clone harboring &lt;&#160;10% mutation at passage two (Fig&#160;1A). Moreover, the intra&#8208;person variability among the hiPSC clones derived from the same patient is revealed by the broad spectrum of mutation load at position 3243 found in the three MELAS patients. This intra&#8208;person variability of a disease&#8208;causing mutation in mtDNA permitted us to isolate mtDNA&#8208;mutant hiPSCs and isogenic wild&#8208;type clones, bypassing the need to perform genome editing assays (Folmes et&#160;al, 2013; Ma et&#160;al, 2015).</text>

      <text>One of the characteristics of pluripotent stem cells is their robust self&#8208;renewal capacity, enabling them to grow indefinitely in culture. A shift toward WT mtDNA was previously described in a small number of hiPSC clones that were maintained in culture for more than 40 passages (Cherry et&#160;al, 2013; Folmes et&#160;al, 2013). In order to determine whether the loss of specific mtDNA mutations in hiPSCs is proportional to time in culture, we assessed the m.3243A&gt;G mutation in a total of 25 hiPSC clones derived from our three MELAS patients at passage two, and again following passage eight, corresponding to approximately 1&#160;month in culture. We observed a general tendency of loss of the m.3243A&gt;G mutation associated with time in culture, at a rate of ~12% per month, when the initial mutation load was greater than 80% (Fig&#160;1B&#8211;D). However, five of the 25 analyzed clones demonstrated essentially no change in heteroplasmy levels (Fig&#160;1B&#8211;D). Moreover, two hiPSC clones showed a dramatic shift in heteroplasmy, decreasing by approximately 50% in a single month (Fig&#160;1B and 1D). On the other hand, increases in mutation load were rare; only two &#8220;wild&#8208;type&#8221; hiPSCs (where the mutation was present below the PCR&#8208;RFLP detection limit) showed an increase in percentage of mutation with time (Fig&#160;1B and C). Our&#160;results show that mtDNA segregation is a dynamic process contributing to the intra&#8208;person variability in hiPSCs.</text>

      <text>We performed whole mtDNA NGS of 36 hiPSC clones with normal karyotype derived from the three MELAS patients, and their associated skin fibroblasts, to assess whether segregation of mtDNA in nuclear reprogramming amplifies mtDNA variants present in the original fibroblasts. Each sample produced an average of 6.4&#160;million 51&#8208;base pair (bp) reads with 83% of the reads mapping to the mitochondrial reference sequence. On average, 96% of the reference sequence had at least 5,000&#215; coverage (Fig&#160;EV1). The variants were analyzed using HaploGrep software, an algorithm that uses PhyloTree (a regularly updated classification tree of global mtDNA variations) to classify haplogroups of individual samples. HaploGrep further classifies variants that are not contained in a sample's haplogroup based on whether (local private mutations) or not (global private mutations [GPMs]) they are found in other haplogroups. Thus, we prioritized the analysis of GPMs as they were unique to the sample and were not related to known haplogroups. Analysis of the mtDNA NGS in hiPSCs revealed that all MitoA&#8208; and MitoB&#8208;derived hiPSC clones contain GPMs; however, the majority of MitoC&#8208;derived hiPSCs contained only the m.3243A&gt;G point mutation (Fig&#160;2).</text>

      <text>Most of the MitoA patient&#8208;derived hiPSC clones contained five GPMs in addition to the MELAS mutation (m.3243A&gt;G): m.2269G&gt;A in MT&#8208;RNR2 (16S rRNA), m.4112T&gt;C in MT&#8208;ND1, m.5133A&gt;G in MT&#8208;ND2, m.9547G&gt;A in MT&#8208;CO3, and m.13918T&gt;C in MT&#8208;ND5 (Fig&#160;2A). Notably, most of the clones that were wild type at position 3243 had the mutation m.9547G&gt;A at different levels of heteroplasmy. In contrast, clones harboring a mutation at position 3243 were wild type at position 9547, but exhibited different levels of point mutations m.4112T&gt;C and m.5133A&gt;G. These results suggest two clearly mitochondrial genotypes in hiPSCs derived from MitoA patient fibroblasts. However, due to the mosaicism in the original fibroblasts, we found hiPSC clones with a different mitochondrial genotype such as MitoA clone 217 (wild type at position 3243 [i.e., 3243A]), with two GPMs with ~80% mutation at m.2269G&gt;A and m.13918T&gt;C, that were not found in any of the other 3243A MitoA hiPSC clones. Moreover, three of the 3243G MitoA hiPSC clones (#224, 61, and 67) had no mutation at positions 4112 or 5133. As expected, all MitoA hiPSC clones have the same haplotype as the original dermal fibroblasts: T2b (Table&#160;EV4).</text>

      <text>Similar results were found in MitoB patient&#8208;derived hiPSC clones, containing two GPMs besides the MELAS mutation: m.1082A&gt;G in MT&#8208;RNR1 (12S rRNA) and m.12005T&gt;C in MT&#8208;ND4 (Fig&#160;2B). Most of the MitoB hiPSC clones that were wild type at 3243 had the mutation m.12005T&gt;C at high levels. On the other hand, high levels of m.3243A&gt;G correlated with high levels of m.1082A&gt;G and the absence or low levels of m.12005T&gt;C. Thus, these results suggest the presence of two main mitochondrial genotypes in MitoB hiPSC clones, having the same haplotype as the parental fibroblasts line: K1a4 (Table&#160;EV4).</text>

      <text>We then asked whether the GPMs found in hiPSC clones were present in the original dermal fibroblasts. Analysis of the mtDNA NGS data showed that all GPMs found in MitoA hiPSC clones were present in the original fibroblasts (MitoA FB p5), even those at very low levels of heteroplasmy (Fig&#160;2A). Notably, the mutation level of m.9547G&gt;A increased massively during nuclear reprogramming, from 0.5% in the fibroblasts to 53% in MitoA hiPSC clone 58 (Fig&#160;2A). Similarly, all GPMs found in the MitoB hiPSC clones were also present in the parental fibroblasts (MitoB FB p3) (Fig&#160;2B). As with the MitoA&#8208;derived hiPSCs, several MitoB hiPSC clones demonstrated levels of heteroplasmy that were amplified in nuclear reprogramming, most remarkably m.12005T&gt;C, which was present at 4% in the original fibroblasts but increased to 100% in selected clones (MitoB clones 36, 322, and 310) (Fig&#160;2B). Low numbers of GPMs at low mutation load were found in MitoC hiPSC clones (Fig&#160;2C) having the same haplotype as the parental fibroblasts line: I4a1). However, in one out of eleven MitoC hiPSC clones (MitoC&#8208;156), the mutation m.12128T&gt;C was present in the original fibroblasts (MitoC FB p7) at 1% mutation load but increased up to 22% in MitoC&#8208;156 clone (Fig&#160;2C).</text>

      <text>Analysis of the GPMs showed that most of the heteroplasmic variants were present at levels lower than 10% in both control and MELAS groups (Fig&#160;3B). However, we prioritized mtDNA variants present at greater than 10% heteroplasmy (Tables&#160;EV3 and EV4); we mapped the location of those variants to the mtDNA (D&#8208;loop, rRNA, tRNA, or OXPHOS protein&#8208;coding genes) in both groups (Fig&#160;3C). Notably, no GPMs were found in the D&#8208;loop in either control or MELAS hiPSCs (Fig&#160;3C). Only 15% of the mapped (i.e., &gt;&#160;10%) GPMs were found at tRNA genes in the control group; half of the variants were present in protein&#8208;coding genes in both groups (Fig&#160;3C).</text>

      <text>To predict whether a specific amino acid substitution might affect protein function, we used the PolyPhen2 algorithm (Adzhubei et&#160;al, 2010). Probably damaging mutations (PolyPhen2 damaging score close to 1) were found in both control and MELAS groups (Fig&#160;3D, Tables&#160;EV3 and EV4). Analysis of the GenBank database revealed that the majority of GPMs were found at low frequency in either control or MELAS groups (Tables&#160;EV3 and EV4). Seven GPMs found in hiPSCs from the control group are not annotated in the MITOMAP database and may represent rare mutations capable of disrupting protein function (Table&#160;1). All mtDNA variants located in protein&#8208;coding regions in the control group have a PolyPhen2 score close to one, indicative of a probably damaging mutation. Moreover, 12 GPMs in the MELAS group are absent from MITOMAP, seven of which are located in protein&#8208;coding genes (Table&#160;1). These results demonstrate that there is a risk of obtaining hiPSC clones with harmful mutations in mtDNA, regardless of whether the parental skin fibroblasts were originated from healthy donors or patients.</text>

      <text>Finally, we determined whether the mtDNA GPMs revealed through nuclear reprogramming affected mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates in hiPSC clones and their differentiated counterparts. In the induced pluripotent state, all hiPSC clones exhibited similar basal and uncoupled respiration regardless their mtDNA genotype (Fig&#160;4E), being in accordance with previous findings showing that hiPSCs are agnostic to disease&#8208;causing mtDNA mutations due to their low reliance in oxidative metabolism (Folmes et&#160;al, 2013). However, once the cells differentiate into cardiomyocytes, they rely mainly on OXPHOS to produce ATP. As expected, MitoA&#8208;61&#8208; and MitoA&#8208;69&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes containing m.3243A&gt;G in MT&#8208;TL1 at 83% of mutation load, displayed basal&#160;and uncoupled respiration rates significantly lower than their wild&#8208;type counterparts (Fig&#160;4F). Remarkably, MitoA&#8208;58&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes with GPM revealed during nuclear reprogramming (m.9547G&gt;A in MT&#8208;CO3 at 70%) exhibited reduced basal and uncoupled mitochondrial oxygen consumption compared with their wild&#8208;type counterparts. The pathogenic effect of this GPM could lead to similar functional defects than MELAS causing disease mutation, when the mutation load reaches the 70%. MitoA&#8208;59&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes harboring the same mutation (m.9547G&gt;A) at 40% heteroplasmy did not show reduced mitochondrial oxygen consumption, demonstrating the required mtDNA mutational threshold to show the mitochondrial defect (Fig&#160;4F). It should be noted that not all the GPMs at high levels of mutation affected mitochondrial oxygen consumption. The MitoA&#8208;217&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes containing the m.13918T&gt;C mutation in MT&#8208;ND5 at 83% exhibited basal and uncoupled respiration rates similar to controls (Fig&#160;4F). These results suggest that analysis of GPMs provides a useful tool for screening for potentially damaging mutations in mtDNA; however, functional analyses are necessary to confirm any causal role.</text>

      <text>Functional variability among hiPSC clones derived from the same individual is one of the primary challenges to interpret and obtain reproducible results.

It is important to note that other sources of variability have been reported previously in nuclear genes, like full or partial chromosomal aberrations (Mayshar et&#160;al, 2010) and copy number variants (Hussein et&#160;al, 2011).</text>

      <text>In order to elucidate whether low levels of heteroplasmic pathogenic mtDNA variants present in donor's fibroblasts can be segregated during nuclear reprogramming, we performed mtDNA next&#8208;generation sequencing in 84 hiPSC clones derived from a cohort of 19 individuals (16 non&#8208;mitochondrial and 3 mitochondrial disease patients). It has been previously shown that the segregation of mtDNA during nuclear reprogramming mirrors the original mosaicism present in the parental fibroblast population (Cherry et&#160;al, 2013; Folmes et&#160;al, 2013), phenomenon that was further confirmed by other groups (Ma et&#160;al, 2015; Yokota et&#160;al, 2015). However, other studies suggest that mtDNA segregation is likely a consequence of the mitochondrial genetic bottleneck during nuclear reprogramming (Hamalainen et&#160;al, 2013). Our results suggest that both phenomena may work together revealing mtDNA mutations originally present at low level of mutation load in the original fibroblasts. Previously, nuclear reprogramming was reported as the cause of new mtDNA mutations in hiPSCs (Prigione et&#160;al, 2011). Similar results were reported recently (Kang et&#160;al, 2016) showing low amount of shared mutation between hiPSC clones and the parental fibroblasts. However, our results obtained from mtDNA NGS analysis of 36 hiPSC clones and their parental dermal patient fibroblasts showed that all mtDNA variants present in the bioengineered stem cells were also present in the corresponding fibroblasts. mtDNA variants are exposed up to 100&#8208;fold during nuclear reprogramming (e.g., from 0.5% of m.9547G&gt;A in the MitoA fibroblasts, up to 53% in MitoA clone 58). The extremely high depth of sequencing that was performed allowed us to separate the low level of heteroplasmy from the background noise. That could be a reason why low level of heteroplasmic mutations was not detected in previous studies in hiPSCs. Our results are in accordance with the Universal Heteroplasmy Theory (Payne et&#160;al, 2013) where very low level of heteroplasmy point mutations (&lt;&#160;1%) appears to be a universal finding among different healthy individuals. Furthermore, the mutation m.9547G&gt;A is annotated in MITOMAP as a somatic mutation. In accordance with the Universal Heteroplasmy Theory, the origin of such very low&#8208;level heteroplasmic variance is likely due to both inherited and somatic single base substitutions (Payne et&#160;al, 2013).</text>

      <text>Moreover, mtDNA NGS analysis of 36 hiPSC clones derived from the three MELAS patients showed that some GPMs co&#8208;segregate with the MELAS causing disease mutation. hiPSC clones wild type at 3243 position carried a GPM in mtDNA (m.9547&#160;G&gt;A in MitoA hiPSC clones or m.12005T&gt;C in MitoB hiPSC clones). Mutant hiPSC clones at 3243 did not harbor those specific mutations, but others GPMs raised like m.4112T&gt;C and m.5133A&gt;G in MitoA hiPSC clones or m.1082A&gt;G in MitoB hiPSC clones. We propose two possible explanations about the co&#8208;segregation of different mitochondrial genotypes in nuclear reprogramming. One is that the segregation of mtDNA is likely determined by nucleoid organization (mtDNA molecules and protein assemblages) during nuclear reprogramming (Gilkerson et&#160;al, 2008; Spelbrink, 2010). In this model, wild&#8208;type 3243 mtDNA molecules are associated with mutant 9547 mtDNA molecules in MitoA hiPSCs, likely through physical association in nucleoids. The second explanation is that both mutations m.3243A&gt;G and m.9547G&gt;A may not coexist in the same cell due to the detrimental effect of both mutations in mitochondrial function, and mitochondria with both mutations are likely degraded through mitophagy (Narendra et&#160;al, 2008).</text>

      <text>Due to the range of mutation loads found in hiPSC clones, it is possible to select those hiPSC clones harboring a high percentage of a pathogenic mtDNA mutation (&#8220;disease state&#8221;), along with those containing very low or no detectable levels of that mutation (&#8220;healthy state&#8221;). Thus, the ability to distinguish between mutated and wild&#8208;type hiPSC clones provides a tremendous advantage to the mitochondrial field, allowing for the examination of mtDNA&#8208;mutant and wild&#8208;type hiPSCs without the need for any additional genomic editing (Folmes et&#160;al, 2013; Hamalainen et&#160;al, 2013; Ma et&#160;al, 2015). However, our results showed the necessity to perform mtDNA NGS to evaluate the presence of additional GPMs, which at high mutation load may have a mitochondrial respiration defect.</text>

      <text>Our results demonstrate that potentially damaging mutations are present in hiPSCs derived from both mitochondrial disease patients and healthy human individuals. Analyses of mtDNA NGS in 84 hiPSCs showed that mtDNA variants with a pathogenic potential can be amplified in patient&#8208;specific hiPSCs. Eight out of 41 hiPSC clones in the control group had a potential level of damaging mutation at &gt;&#160;10%. Our results are in accordance with recent findings of the 1000 Genome Project, where at least 20% of individuals harbor heteroplasmies implicated in disease (Ye et&#160;al, 2014). Moreover, mtDNA variants can be a consequence of replication errors and clonal expansion in the original dermal fibroblasts. Accumulation of those replication errors over a life span may correspond to an aging phenotype (Pinto &amp; Moraes, 2015). Our results show that low levels of heteroplasmic mtDNA variants are revealed in nuclear reprogramming regardless of donor's age, as we found GPMs exhibiting heteroplasmy levels in excess of 10% in hiPSC clones derived from individuals from 1&#160;month of age to 44&#160;years of age in control group (Fig&#160;EV2), supporting the Universal Heteroplasmy Theory as the process responsible for the differences exposed in mtDNA during nuclear reprogramming, rather than an accumulation of somatic mutations with age (Kang et&#160;al, 2016). Our findings demonstrate that hidden mtDNA heteroplasmy can profoundly affect hiPSC function when differentiated into cardiac lineages and is consistent with emerging evidence that indicates a generalizable mechanism inherent to clonal expansion of hiPSC clones (Kang et&#160;al, 2016). Additionally, our data establish that all ages of patients and independent of mitochondrial disease phenotype are vulnerable to mtDNA load. Conversely, low heteroplasmy hiPSC clones are commonly identified even from mitochondrial patients expected to have high heteroplasmy based on clinical presentation.</text>

      <text>In addition to maintaining patient&#8208;specific mtDNA mutations in hiPSCs, nuclear reprogramming with clonal expansion can reveal low&#8208;level inherited or somatic mtDNA variants up to levels capable of compromising mitochondrial respiration in the differentiated progeny from specific clones. Upon successful in&#160;vitro cardiac differentiation of hiPSCs harboring mutations in mtDNA, these results demonstrate that heteroplasmy levels of mtDNA variants remain stable during differentiation and allow for genotype/phenotype analysis. Moreover, hiPSC&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes with point mutations revealed during nuclear reprogramming like m.9547G&gt;A displayed significantly impaired mitochondrial respiration similar to m.3243A&gt;G MELAS causing disease mutation. The cardiac differentiation potential of the hiPSCs harboring those mutations was not affected. It is well established that patients with mitochondrial disease develop cardiac manifestations like hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, left ventricular myocardial non&#8208;compaction, and heart failure (Meyers et&#160;al, 2013). More experimental work is necessary to modeling this defect in&#160;vitro. Remarkably, our results demonstrated that the purifying selection observed in the mitochondrial embryonic bottleneck in mice (Stewart et&#160;al, 2008), where the mutations that are likely to affect a mtDNA&#8208;encoded protein are being strongly selected against, is not present during nuclear reprogramming. Thus, nuclear reprogramming produces hiPSCs with mutations in protein&#8208;coding genes with potentially damaging effects in the differentiated progeny required for most hiPSC applications.</text>

      <text>Our results underscore the potential of using mtDNA NGS in patient&#8208;specific hiPSCs to characterize possible pathogenic mtDNA variants that have detrimental effects in the differentiated progeny and usually are at very low levels of heteroplasmy in the parental fibroblasts and typically ignored. Our analysis of global private mutations using HaploGrep software together with functional analyses of mitochondrial oxygen consumption in the differentiated progeny is a powerful tool for screening for potentially damaging mtDNA variants in hiPSCs. We propose mtDNA sequencing as an important release criterion for selection of hiPSC clones, in addition to assays already being extensively employed like colony morphology, DNA fingerprint analysis, karyotype, RNA profiling, and teratoma formation. We believe that mtDNA NGS will become a critical tool in regenerative medicine due to the ability to screen and identify potentially damaged hiPSC clones and prevent unintended consequences due to intra&#8208;person variability.</text>

      <text>Skin biopsies from 16 non&#8208;mitochondrial disease patients (control group) were obtained in accordance with Mayo Clinic institutional regulations (Mayo Clinic IRB 10&#8208;006845, Clinical Trials Identifier NCT01860898) (Table&#160;EV1). Similarly, skin biopsies from three unrelated MELAS patients (CUMC&#8208;MitoA [MitoA], CUMC&#8208;BM [MitoB], and CUMC&#8208;MitoC [MitoC]) with the same mutation m.3243A&gt;G in MT&#8208;TL1 (tRNALeu(UUR)) at different heteroplasmy levels (17, 45, 46%) were obtained in accordance with Columbia University regulations (Table&#160;EV2).</text>

      <text>All primary human skin fibroblasts were reprogrammed by ReGen Theranostics (Rochester, MN) with similar efficiency, using CytoTune&#8208;iPS Sendai Reprogramming Kits according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, A13780&#8208;02, A16517, A16518). MELAS fibroblasts and derived hiPSC were supplemented with 50&#160;&#956;g/ml of uridine. All hiPSC clones were culture in mTeSR1 medium (STEMCELL Technologies). An average of 14 hiPSC clones from MitoA, MitoB, and MitoC patients were expanded and further characterized by matched fingerprint analysis with the original fibroblasts, 88% of them had normal karyotype. Finger printing analyses were performed by CellLine Genetics (Madison, WI). Karyotype analyses were performed by the Cytogenetics Core at Mayo Clinic.</text>

      <text>Whole mtDNA NGS was performed by the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology Molecular Genetics Laboratory and the Medical Genome Facility at Mayo Clinic, using the revised Cambridge reference sequence (rCRS; GenBank accession # NC_012920.1) as the reference sequence for the mtDNA. Two overlapping long&#8208;range PCR (LR&#8208;PCR) products (11,745 and 5,277&#160;bp) of the complete 16,569&#8208;bp mitochondrial genome, originating from a total DNA specimen, were visually confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and gel imaging. The samples were prepped and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 with 51&#8208;bp paired&#8208;end reads.</text>

      <text>Analysis of the mtDNA NGS data was performed by the Bioinformatics Core at Mayo Clinic. The paired&#8208;end reads were aligned to the rCRS using Novoalign 2.08.01 (www.novocraft.com) with single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions (INDELS) called by Varscan 2.3.5 (Koboldt et&#160;al, 2012). Analysis of the mtDNA variants was performed using HaploGrep v1.0&#8208;140222 software and PhyloTree 16 (van Oven &amp; Kayser, 2009; Kloss&#8208;Brandstatter et&#160;al, 2011). HaploGrep is an algorithm that uses PhyloTree (a regularly updated classification tree of global mtDNA variations) to classify haplogroups of individual samples. HaploGrep further classifies variants that are not contained in a sample's haplogroup based on whether (local private mutations) or not (global private mutations) they are found in other haplogroups.</text>

      <text>hiPSCs were cultured in monolayer for four days prior to cardiac induction. hiPSCs were subjected to direct in&#160;vitro cardiac differentiation as described elsewhere (Burridge et&#160;al, 2014) with small modifications. In brief, cardiac induction was performed in confluent Geltrex&#174; (ThermoFisher A1413301) coated 96&#8208;well plate with 6&#160;&#956;M CHIR99021 (STEMGENT 04&#8208;0004) and 10&#160;ng/ml of recombinant activin A (R&amp;D systems 338&#8208;AC&#8208;01M/CF) for 20&#160;h. At day 3 post&#8208;induction, medium was changed and supplemented with 5&#160;&#956;M IWP2 (TOCRIS 3533) and 10&#160;ng/ml of recombinant human BMP&#8208;4 (R&amp;D systems 314&#8208;BP&#8208;010) for 2&#160;days. Beating cardiomyocyte cultures were subjected to a lactate cardiomyocyte enrichment protocol (Tohyama et&#160;al, 2013) between days 14 and 16 post&#8208;induction in order to increase the percentage of cardiomyocytes in culture, reducing the cell population heterogeneity. At day 16, single&#8208;cell hiPSC&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes were isolated using 0.05&#160;U of TH Research Grade Liberase (SIGMA 5401135001) and 6.3 U of DNase I (SIGMA D4513&#8208;1VL) in RPMI medium (per well of 96&#8208;well plate). Single&#8208;cell hiPSC&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes were replated in Geltrex&#174; coated plates for further analysis.</text>

After washing with PBS, cells were permeabilized using solution 2 contained in the Intra Prep permeabilization kit (Beckman Coulter, A07803). hiPSC&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes were stained using Anti&#8208;Myosin Heavy Chain Alexa Fluor&#174; 488 (eBioscience, MF&#8208;20 53&#8208;6503&#8208;82), PE mouse Anti&#8208;Cardiac Troponin T (BD PharmigenTM 564767), and Alexa Fluor&#174; 647 Mouse Anti&#8208;Cardiac Troponin I (BD PharmigenTM 564409) to each stain tube. Finally, tubes were washed with DPBS and assayed by flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter Gallios 10&#8208;color flow cytometer).</text>

      <text>Oxygen consumption rates were measured using a XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences, Billerica Massachusetts). In brief, cells were plated into wells of a XF24 Cell Culture Microplate and maintained until 80% confluent. Prior to assay, plates were equilibrated in unbuffered XF assay medium supplemented with 25&#160;mM glucose, 2&#160;mM glutaMAX, 1&#160;mM sodium pyruvate, 1&#215; non&#8208;essential amino acids, and 1% FBS in the absence of CO2 for 1&#160;h. Mitochondrial processes were interrogated by serial addition of carbonyl cyanide 4&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP; 0.3&#160;&#956;M for hiPSCs and 2&#160;&#956;M for hiPSC&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes) and rotenone (0.5&#160;&#956;M) plus antimycin A (1&#160;&#956;M) to establish basal respiration rates and maximal (uncoupled) respiration. Each plotted value was normalized to basal oxygen consumption and total protein quantified using a Bradford assay (Bio&#8208;Rad, Hercules, California), using MitoA clone 57 as control.</text>
