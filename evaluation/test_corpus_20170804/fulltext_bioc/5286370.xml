      <text>The development of resistance remains a major obstacle to long&#8208;term disease control in cancer patients treated with targeted therapies. In BRAF&#8208;mutant mouse models, we demonstrate that although targeted inhibition of either BRAF or VEGF initially suppresses the growth of BRAF&#8208;mutant tumors, combined inhibition of both pathways results in apoptosis, long&#8208;lasting tumor responses, reduction in lung colonization, and delayed onset of acquired resistance to the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720. As well as inducing tumor vascular normalization and ameliorating hypoxia, this approach induces remodeling of the extracellular matrix, infiltration of macrophages with an M1&#8208;like phenotype, and reduction in cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts. At the molecular level, this therapeutic regimen results in a de novo transcriptional signature, which sustains and explains the observed efficacy with regard to cancer progression. Collectively, our findings offer new biological rationales for the management of clinical resistance to BRAF inhibitors based on the combination between BRAFV 600E inhibitors with anti&#8208;angiogenic regimens.</text>

      <text>Activating mutations in the BRAF oncogene occur in approximately 7% of human malignancies, including 50&#8211;60% of melanomas and 5&#8211;8% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) (Davies et&#160;al, 2002). BRAF mutations are associated with adverse clinical outcomes in melanoma, thyroid carcinoma, non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer, and CRC (Cantwell&#8208;Dorris et&#160;al, 2011). The most frequent BRAF mutation (V600E) (Halilovic &amp; Solit, 2008) affects the kinase domain, leading to constitutive activation of the protein. Oncogenic BRAF induces downstream phosphorylation of MEK and ERK, which in turn triggers cell autonomous proliferation even in the absence of extracellular growth factors (Davies et&#160;al, 2002).</text>

      <text>Specific inhibitors of BRAFV600E, including vemurafenib and dabrafenib, have been approved for treating BRAF&#8208;mutant metastatic melanomas (Bollag et&#160;al, 2010; Flaherty et&#160;al, 2012; Hauschild et&#160;al, 2012). Although these drugs show remarkable clinical efficacy and improve overall survival, almost all patients develop resistance and subsequently relapse (Bollag et&#160;al, 2010; Flaherty et&#160;al, 2012). A combination of BRAF and MEK inhibition further improves time to progression and overall survival in patients with metastatic melanomas when compared with single&#8208;agent BRAF inhibition (Paraiso et&#160;al, 2010). It is likely that the limited efficacy of combinations targeting a single oncogenic pathway is due to the plasticity and ability of cancer cells to circumvent such a blockade.</text>

      <text>Additional strategies must be exploited to increase the efficacy of BRAFV600E inhibitors and circumvent or delay the onset of resistance. Several studies on the effects of BRAFV600E inhibitors on the cellular transcriptional landscape have envisaged new, attractive preclinical combinations with molecules affecting specific processes, including glucose metabolism (Parmenter et&#160;al, 2014), the immune response (Hu&#8208;Lieskovan et&#160;al, 2014), and autophagy (Goodall et&#160;al, 2014), to improve the antitumor effects of BRAFV600E inhibitors.</text>

      <text>In physiological angiogenesis, the effects of pro&#8208;angiogenic molecules are counterbalanced by those of endogenous inhibitors. During tumor angiogenesis, this balance is tipped in favor of new vessel formation. However, the resulting vessels are highly abnormal both structurally and functionally. This balance could be restored by removing the excess of VEGF&#8208;A (VEGF) or by blocking VEGF signaling, which would induce pruning of abnormal vessels, resulting in vascular normalization characterized by improved perfusion and alleviation of hypoxia. Hence, strategies that favor vascular normalization could improve the efficacy of cancer therapies (Jain, 2014).</text>

      <text>We and others have previously demonstrated that BRAFV600E triggers an angiogenic response by modifying the expression profile of angiogenic inducers (Durante et&#160;al, 2011; Bottos et&#160;al, 2012; Sadow et&#160;al, 2014). Thus, enhanced angiogenesis and tumor&#8211;stroma cross&#8208;talk may represent an additional therapeutic target in the context of BRAFV600E&#8208;driven tumors. We reported that BRAFV600E inhibition by the vemurafenib analog PLX4720 in xenografts did not reduce the number of tumor capillaries but instead favored vascular normalization (Bottos et&#160;al, 2012).</text>

      <text>Based on this premise, we hypothesized that BRAF&#8208;targeted inhibitors could cooperate with anti&#8208;angiogenic regimens in the treatment of BRAF&#8208;mutant tumors. Specifically, in this work, we investigated the combined effects of PLX4720 and bevacizumab, an anti&#8208;VEGF humanized monoclonal antibody, in xenograft models of melanoma and CRC. We report that this dual treatment induces a new genetic program that regulates myeloid cell recruitment and extracellular matrix remodeling and is more efficient than either single agent for controlling tumor growth and the onset of resistance.</text>

      <text>Cohorts of CD1&#8208;immunocompromised mice bearing A375 BRAFV600E&#8208;mutant melanoma xenografts were treated with PLX4720, bevacizumab, or a combination of both (COMBO). PLX4720 or bevacizumab alone caused a clear delay in tumor growth, resulting in a 45% or 56% reduction in tumor volume, respectively, compared with vehicle alone. However, neither single treatment induced a regression of initial tumor size. Concurrent administration of the two drugs at the same doses increased antitumor activity, with 88% reduction in tumor volume compared to vehicle and shrinking by 58% the initial tumor size (Fig&#160;1A). Similar results were obtained by treating CRC COLO205 xenografts. PLX4720, bevacizumab, and COMBO, respectively, inhibited of 61, 57, and 80% tumor growth (Fig&#160;1B). These data indicate that bevacizumab improves the efficacy of the therapeutic inhibition of the oncogenic driver BRAFV600E.</text>

      <text>Then, we evaluated the effect of PLX4720, bevacizumab, and COMBO on lung colonization of the MC&#8208;1 cell line, which is an highly metastatic variant of A375 cells (Orso et&#160;al, 2016) (Fig&#160;1C). Treatments were started 12&#160;weeks after i.v. cell injection and maintained up to week 14. Lung staining by hematoxylin&#8211;eosin (HE) revealed that only COMBO treatment significantly reduced lung nodules area compared to controls (vehicle, 5.1&#160;&#177;&#160;1.4%; COMBO, 0.6&#160;&#177;&#160;0.1%).</text>

      <text>To investigate the mechanism sustaining the observed tumor shrinkage, we measured cellular proliferation and apoptosis in A375 tumors. The number of proliferating cells did not differ significantly among the three treatment groups. Bevacizumab, PLX4720, and COMBO decreased Ki67 staining by 69, 55, and 58%, respectively, compared to controls (n&#160;=&#160;4 tumors; Fig&#160;1D). By contrast, only COMBO treatment induced a significant increase in apoptosis (22.4&#160;&#177;&#160;3.3%, n&#160;=&#160;3 tumors) compared with vehicle (5.7&#160;&#177;&#160;1.2%, n&#160;=&#160;3 tumors) as revealed by TUNEL staining; Fig&#160;1E) and by the accumulation of caspase&#8208;cleaved cytokeratin 18 fragment (Appendix&#160;Fig S1). These findings support that the antitumor activity observed with COMBO treatment depends on an apoptotic program rather than modification of tumor cell cycle.</text>

PLX4720 alone or in combination with bevacizumab increased the number of the smallest capillaries (surface &lt;&#160;100&#160;&#956;m2) and reduced the number of larger vessels (surface &gt;&#160;500&#160;&#956;m2; Appendix&#160;Fig S2B). None of the different therapeutic treatments modified the number of vessels with surface areas from 100 to 500&#160;&#956;m2.</text>

      <text>Modification of the vascular area is a component of vascular normalization upon treatment with anti&#8208;angiogenic compounds (Jain, 2014). A specific hallmark of this process is the improvement of vascular perfusion, which was studied by the i.v. delivery of orange fluorescent microspheres. PLX4720 or COMBO increased vascular perfusion in A375 xenografts compared with treatment with vehicle or bevacizumab (Fig&#160;2C). As expected, PLX4720 treatment restored tissue oxygenation in this model (Fig&#160;2D) as well in COLO205 xenografts in agreement with our earlier report (Bottos et&#160;al, 2012). Interestingly, this positive effect was maintained when bevacizumab was combined with PLX4720. Since normalization process may include improvement of pericyte coverage, we assessed the presence of pericytes surrounding capillaries using the specific NG2 marker. We observed that none of the treatments modified pericyte coverage compared with untreated tumors in A375 xenografts (Appendix&#160;Fig S2C).</text>

      <text>In A375 xenografts, the stromal microenvironment is contributed by the mouse. Therefore, species&#8208;specific analysis of gene expression can discriminate the effects of different therapeutic regimens on tumor (human) and stroma (mouse) compartment. Human and mouse microarrays were analyzed separately to determine the dynamic changes within each compartment of the xenograft upon treatment with PLX4720, bevacizumab, or COMBO. Of the 23,025 human genes that were above background, a supervised comparison (one&#8208;way ANOVA with Benjamini&#8211;Hochberg (BJ) false discovery rate (FDR) correction) among the four treatment arms revealed a set of 68 differentially modulated genes (Appendix&#160;Fig S3A).</text>

A comparison between each treatment arm and the vehicle group by LIMMA (Smyth, 2005) defined a subset of 340 genes modulated by PLX4720 alone (145 up&#8208;regulated and 195 down&#8208;regulated), 201 genes modulated by COMBO (152 up&#8208;regulated and 49 down&#8208;regulated), and only four genes modulated by bevacizumab alone (two up&#8208;regulated and two down&#8208;regulated).</text>

DAVID was used to identify the biological functions enriched in the different treatments in human A375 melanoma cells, considering up&#8208; and down&#8208;regulated genes separately (significant P&#8208;value &lt;&#160;0.05 after BJ FDR method; Appendix&#160;Fig S3C). Genes that were down&#8208;regulated in PLX4720 or COMBO groups were highly enriched in gene sets involved in &#8220;oxygen levels&#8221; and &#8220;response to hypoxia&#8221;. This result is consistent with the observation that tumors are less hypoxic after treatment with PLX4720 or COMBO. Genes that were up&#8208;regulated in the PLX4720 and COMBO groups showed enrichment in the Gene Ontology (GO) categories of &#8220;immune response&#8221;, &#8220;defense responses&#8221;, and &#8220;inflammatory response&#8221;. Interestingly, in the GO categories related to immune and inflammatory responses, we identified a cluster of cytokine and chemokine genes. Genes involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, extracellular structure organization, biological adhesion, and cell adhesion were only modulated by treatment with PLX4720 alone (Appendix&#160;Tables S1 and S2). Taken together, these analyses indicate highly but not completely overlapping functional processes triggered by PLX4720 and COMBO in the human cell compartment of the tumor. This model does not indicate a significant direct functional signature for bevacizumab treatment on the human cell compartment.</text>

      <text>To further characterize the effects of COMBO on the microenvironment of A375 xenografts, we performed mouse&#8208;specific gene expression profiling. Of the 14,533 mouse genes that were above background, ANOVA highlighted a larger number of stromal mouse genes that were significantly altered in the four treatment arms compared to the human arrays (n&#160;=&#160;806, one&#8208;way ANOVA after BJ FDR correction). In this case, sample cluster analysis highlighted expression similarities between the vehicle and bevacizumab groups and between the PLX4720 and COMBO groups, with PLX4720 and COMBO inducing a substantially wider gene modulation (Appendix&#160;Fig S4A). A subset of bevacizumab&#8208;modulated genes related to angiogenesis (compared with vehicle, fold change threshold | log2 FC | of 0.5) is reported and further validated by quantitative PCR analysis (Appendix&#160;Fig S4B and C). Volcano plots show the changes in the log2&#8208;fold change and P&#8208;values for all genes for the different treatments (Appendix&#160;Fig S4D), and Venn diagrams illustrate the overlapping subsets of modulated genes (Fig&#160;3B). Among the 805 genes modulated by PLX4720 identified by LIMMA analysis, 517 were down&#8208;regulated, and 288 were up&#8208;regulated. COMBO had a reduced modulatory effect (414 genes; 214 suppressed and 200 induced). GO analysis was performed on the three treatment arms compared with vehicle using DAVID (P&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05 with BH FDR correction), considering up&#8208; and down&#8208;regulated genes separately. Among the down&#8208;regulated genes, PLX4720 treatment mainly targeted genes belonging to GO terms characterizing functions and processes of the vasculature (&#8220;blood vessel development&#8221;, &#8220;vasculature development&#8221;, &#8220;blood vessel morphogenesis&#8221;, &#8220;angiogenesis&#8221;; Fig&#160;3C and Appendix&#160;Tables S3 and S4) in accordance with the observed effect on tumor vessel shape and functions (Fig&#160;2). DAVID analysis of the COMBO response revealed that the top enriched functions belonged to the immune response (up&#8208;modulated genes), blood vessel, and cell adhesion (down&#8208;modulated genes; Fig&#160;3C). A comparison between the lists of genes modulated in A375 xenografts by PLX4720 or COMBO with respect to vehicle revealed a subset of commonly modulated genes and sizeable subsets of genes specifically modulated by one of the two treatments only.</text>

      <text>Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was carried out on mouse microarray data set to identify associated biological processes and pathways related to COMBO treatment. By comparing COMBO group with all the other groups, GSEA revealed an enrichment of genes involved in immune response (&#8220;Reactome Cytokine Signaling in Immune System&#8221; and &#8220;Reactome Innate Immune System&#8221;) and down&#8208;modulation of genes associated with the ECM remodeling (&#8220;Reactome Extracellular Matrix Organization&#8221; and &#8220;Reactome Collagen Formation&#8221;; Fig&#160;3D). This analysis was confirmed by the heatmaps of genes associated with these categories (Fig&#160;3E and Appendix&#160;S4E), indicating that COMBO increased the expression of Toll&#8208;like receptors, cytokines and their receptors (Il1&#946;, Il18, Il6r), interferon&#8208;related proteins (Irf2), monocytes/macrophage marker (Cd14) and decreased the expression of many collagens. Last, we performed a pathway analysis of the 258 genes that selectively characterized the COMBO treatment, that is, the genes modulated by COMBO versus vehicle. Ingenuity pathways analysis (IPA) revealed gene networks similar to those previously predicted by GO enrichment analysis. In particular, a 24&#8208;gene network related to collagen deposition and a 26&#8208;gene network clustering around immune cell trafficking displayed extensive regulation (Appendix&#160;Fig S4F). Taken together, these results indicate that the combination of PLX4720 with bevacizumab specifically alters alternative biological pathways associated with ECM remodeling, inflammation, and immune response. Interestingly, IPA analyses revealed a network of cytokine and chemokine genes that were also identified in the human transcriptome. TNF&#945;, TGF&#946;, and IL1&#946; were among the top five IPA upstream regulators that were selectively modulated after COMBO treatment (Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S5).</text>

      <text>The evaluation of angiogenic response to COMBO treatment together with the gene expression analysis suggested that vascular changes alone were unlikely to explain the enhancement of tumor inhibition observed after COMBO regimen. Therefore, we investigated whether the immune gene signature promoted by this treatment resulted in recruitment of myeloid cells, which are still present in CD1 athymic mice. Immunofluorescence staining for the pan&#8208;hematopoietic cell surface marker CD45 revealed that only COMBO treatment induced marked leukocyte infiltration in A375 xenografts (CD45+ % area, 24.4&#160;&#177;&#160;3.1%), which was negligible in vehicle&#8208;treated mice (3.0&#160;&#177;&#160;0.5%) or after treatment with PLX4720 (5.1&#160;&#177;&#160;0.9%) or bevacizumab (6.9&#160;&#177;&#160;1.4%) (n&#160;=&#160;5 tumors; Fig&#160;4A) alone. A similar pattern was seen in COLO205 xenografts. Leukocyte infiltration increased twofold after COMBO treatment (CD45+ % area, COMBO: 9.3&#160;&#177;&#160;1.2%; vehicle 3.8&#160;&#177;&#160;0.5%), decreased after PLX4720 treatment (2.3&#160;&#177;&#160;0.3%), and increased modestly but not significantly after bevacizumab treatment (4.9&#160;&#177;&#160;1.1%) (n&#160;=&#160;5 tumors; Fig&#160;4A). The features of the infiltrate were further investigated by specific immune phenotype analysis. We observed that F4/80+ (Fig&#160;4B) macrophages represented the most abundant leukocyte population when the BRAFV600E and VEGF pathways were simultaneously blocked in both A375 (F4/80+ area, 27.8&#160;&#177;&#160;3.3% vs. 8.4&#160;&#177;&#160;1.2% in vehicle) and COLO205 (F4/80+ area, 10.6&#160;&#177;&#160;1.5% vs. 2.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.8% in vehicle) xenografts. In both models, the single&#8208;drug treatments did not modify the amount of infiltrating F4/80+ cells compared with controls. Immunofluorescence results were further confirmed by flow cytometry analysis (FACS) on untreated and COMBO&#8208;treated A375 tumors. Fig&#160;4C shows that COMBO treatment induced a higher CD45+ leukocyte recruitment compared with vehicle, which was mainly constituted by F4/80+ tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) and CD11c+MHCII+ dendritic cells (DC) (Fig&#160;4D).</text>

      <text>To characterize the phenotype associated with the recruited macrophages, we performed species&#8208;specific real&#8208;time quantitative real&#8208;time PCR analysis to assess specific mouse transcripts relative to the M1 and M2 polarization, which, respectively, have antitumor and pro&#8208;tumor effects (Mantovani &amp; Sica, 2009). Tumors treated with COMBO expressed significantly higher amounts of M1 markers, such as m&#8208;Ccl5, m&#8208;Cd40, m&#8208;Cxcl10, m&#8208;Cxcl9, m&#8208;Il1b, m&#8208;Stat1, and m&#8208;Il1b, compared with vehicle&#8208;treated tumors. COMBO&#8208;treated tumors also expressed reduced levels of the M2 marker m&#8208;Arg1 (Fig&#160;5A), while m&#8208;Il10, which characterizes M2 polarization, was not affected. Tumors treated with PLX4720 or bevacizumab alone did not exhibit any significant modulation of macrophage&#8208;associated genes (Fig&#160;5A). The ability of COMBO treatment to induce a specific TAM polarization was additionally analyzed by immunofluorescence analysis. Fig&#160;5B shows that COMBO treatment specifically increased the recruitment of CCR7+CD68+ M1 cells without any effect on CD206+CD68+ M2 cells. These data were further confirmed by ex&#160;vivo experiments on tumor cells isolated from vehicle&#8208; and COMBO&#8208;treated xenografts and in&#160;vitro stimulated with ionomycin and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Fig&#160;5C shows that COMBO regimen primed CD45+F480+ cells to express&#160;more iNOS and TNF&#945;, which characterize M1&#8208;polarization (Mantovani &amp; Sica, 2009), than vehicle. These observations suggest that TAMs recruited by COMBO have an M1 phenotype, which can explain the superior effect of the dual therapeutic regimen on tumor burden compared with the effect of mono&#8208;therapies (Fig&#160;1).</text>

      <text>To discriminate between a systemic or tumor site&#8208;specific effect of COMBO, we separately assessed the rate of circulating and tumor&#8208;recruited inflammatory monocytes (CD45+Cd11b+Ly6Chigh cells; Shi &amp; Pamer, 2011). COMBO increased this cell population in A375 tumors but not in bloodstream (Fig&#160;5D and E). CD45+CD11b+/Ly6Chigh tumor&#8208;resident monocytes were further studied by the expression of inflammatory markers TNF&#945; and iNOS (Shi &amp; Pamer, 2011) after in&#160;vitro stimulation with ionomycin and PMA. As shown in Fig&#160;5D, COMBO regimen enhanced the expression of both markers as compared to untreated tumors. Interestingly, when we analyzed the expression of macrophage chemotactic cytokines produced by tumor cells in the xenograft model, we observed a significant increase in human GM&#8208;CSF and human TNF&#945; levels after PLX4720 exposure independently from bevacizumab treatment (Appendix&#160;Fig S5A). To determine whether this M1&#8208;like phenotype correlated with enhanced antitumor effect, we co&#8208;cultured the whole cell population isolated from vehicle&#8208; or COMBO&#8208;treated xenografts with parental Zs&#8208;Green&#8208;A375 tumor cells to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of leukocytes present in the tumors. Isolated cells from COMBO&#8208;treated tumors induced higher cytolytic activity of co&#8208;cultured Zs&#8208;Green&#8208;A375 cells than cells isolated from vehicle tumors (Fig&#160;5F). This result suggests that TAMs recruited by the COMBO regimen display tumoricidal activity, most likely mediated by the M1 phenotype.</text>

      <text>The microarray data also highlighted ECM remodeling in A375 xenografts. We therefore examined whether matrix deposition was also affected by BRAFV600E and VEGF blockade. We observed that&#160;COMBO treatment reduced the amount of type I collagen area fraction (COMBO: 7.3&#160;&#177;&#160;0.9% vs. vehicle: 14.9&#160;&#177;&#160;1.1%), while neither single agent was effective (type I collagen&#8208;positive area,&#160;PLX4720 14.6&#160;&#177;&#160;1.3%; bevacizumab: 16.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.9%) (n&#160;=&#160;5 tumors; Fig&#160;6A). The significant reduction in collagen I in COMBO&#8208;treated tumors indicates that blockade of BRAFV600E and VEGF induces the degradation of matrix or prevented matrix production. In tumors, ECM dynamics are largely orchestrated by cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) (Kalluri &amp; Zeisberg, 2006). Therefore, we investigated whether COMBO treatment could also&#160;reduce CAF density. Tumor sections were stained with an antibody against &#945;SMA, a specific marker of CAF and pericytes. We observed that COMBO treatment lowered the density of non&#8208;perivascular &#945;SMA&#8208;positive cells, suggesting a decrease in CAFs (n&#160;=&#160;5 tumors; Fig&#160;6B).</text>

      <text>Of relevance, microarray analyses of murine gene expression data indicated that proteolytic enzymes, including matrix metalloproteinases (Mmp3, Mmp9, Mmp10; Fig&#160;3E) were reduced after COMBO treatment. Therefore, it is plausible that the reduced amount of collagen I in COMBO&#8208;treated tumors mainly reflects impaired deposition rather than increased degradation. We investigated also the expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX), which regulates tissue stiffness by collagen cross&#8208;linking (Barker et&#160;al, 2012). Of interest, COMBO treatment reduced the LOX expression (COMBO: 3.5&#160;&#177;&#160;0.7% vs. vehicle: 6.6&#160;&#177;&#160;0.8%), while PLX4720 single&#8208;drug treatment did not alter its expression and bevacizumab modestly increased its levels (n&#160;=&#160;3 tumors; Fig&#160;6C). Accordingly, IPA analyses of murine gene modulated by COMBO indicated that TGF&#946;1 signaling, which is involved in regulating the cellular production of ECM molecules and CAF differentiation (Shukla et&#160;al, 2014), was a top upstream regulator of the class of genes negatively modulated by COMBO (Fig&#160;6D and Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S5). The value of this computational prediction was experimentally confirmed. COMBO did not significantly modify the abundance of murine Tgfb1 mRNA, but it was the most effective treatment in reducing the level of human TGF&#946; analyzed by a pan TGF&#946; antibody and of human TGFB1 transcript (Fig&#160;6E and F).</text>

      <text>To explore the role of TAMs in the enhanced tumor activity observed in COMBO treatment, clodronate liposomes were used to deplete macrophages during treatments. Clodronate alone promoted a tumor inhibitory effect as previously reported in other tumor models (Fischer et&#160;al, 2007). Nevertheless, clodronate co&#8208;administration impaired the effect of COMBO, which had a cytostatic effect without inducing tumor shrinkage (COMBO plus clodronate: 129.6&#160;&#177;&#160;35.2% of tumor starting size, COMBO: 33.2&#160;&#177;&#160;14.6% of tumor starting size; Fig&#160;7A). Immunofluorescence staining of F4/80+ cells confirmed that clodronate liposomes really depleted macrophages in COMBO&#8208;treated A375 tumors (F4/80+ area, 23.5&#160;&#177;&#160;1.7% in COMBO group and 2.2&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2% in COMBO clodronate group; Fig&#160;7B). Interestingly, the decreased type I collagen deposition induced by COMBO treatment still persisted in the presence of clodronate liposomes (Fig&#160;7C), suggesting that the ECM remodeling mostly depended on a direct effect of the combination of VEGF and BRAF inhibition.</text>

Therefore, we investigated the therapeutic effect of PLX4720 and bevacizumab alone or in combination over a period of 6&#160;weeks in melanoma A375 xenografts. After 2&#160;weeks of treatment, detectable tumor relapse progressively occurred in mice that received mono&#8208;therapy with PLX4720 or bevacizumab. After 6&#160;weeks, tumor volumes were comparable to untreated controls (Appendix&#160;Fig S6A). In COMBO&#8208;treated mice, only three of six tumors resumed growth after 6&#160;weeks while three were still in response (one complete, two partial; Fig&#160;7D).</text>

      <text>Here, we demonstrate that targeting the vascular compartment of tumor tissue with bevacizumab can modulate response to PLX4720 of melanoma xenografts harboring the BRAFV600E mutation. The final result of the drug combination is an enhanced anticancer effect and a delay of the onset of resistance to PLX4720. This effect is the result of the following biological processes, which are not triggered by treatment with either drug alone: (i) the recruitment of M1 polarized TAMs, which have efficient antitumor activity (Mantovani &amp; Sica, 2009); and (ii) remodeling of the ECM characterized by a reduction in collagen I and in CAFs. This cooperative effect is mediated by the adoption of a de novo transcriptional signature (neomorphic effect) (Pritchard et&#160;al, 2013), that was not observed in the presence of either agent alone.</text>

      <text>The COMBO treatment triggers a neomorphic footprint mainly characterized by the presence of M1&#8208;like TAMs. This immune response is sustained by a general modification of the entire tumor transcriptional landscape characterized by an enrichment of genes related to leukocyte recruitment. We hypothesize that the COMBO promotes the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes that undergo M1 polarization switch necessary for the enhanced efficacy of this regimen on A375 xenografts compared to single agents. This hypothesis is based on the in&#160;vitro cytotoxic effect on A375 cells of the bulk tumor cell population isolated from COMBO&#8208;treated mice, but not from untreated mice had. Furthermore, the comparative analysis of responder and relapsing A375 xenografts after long&#8208;term COMBO treatment demonstrated that M1&#8208;like TAM infiltrate persists in the former but not in the latter. Interestingly, BRAFV600E inhibition by PLX4720 can dampen the immune&#8208;suppressive activity observed in melanomas (Khalili et&#160;al, 2012; Frederick et&#160;al, 2013).</text>

      <text>A second effect of COMBO treatment on myeloid compartment is an increase in a subpopulation expressing neuropilin&#8208;1 and CD11b, which have been reported to favor vascular normalization and inhibit tumor growth when directly injected in B16.F10 melanomas at relative high cell concentration (2&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;cells/tumor) (Carrer et&#160;al, 2012).</text>

      <text>The second neomorphic effect of COMBO influences genes involved in ECM remodeling and cell&#8208;matrix adhesion. Similar to the signature reported by Hirata et&#160;al (2015), PLX4720 monotherapy of A375 xenografts increased the transcription of human genes involved in ECM organization and biological cell adhesion. The administration of PLX4720 in combination with bevacizumab counteracted this signature and reduced the number of CAFs and the amount of collagen I. As reported for M1&#8208;like TAM infiltrate, responder mice to the COMBO continue to show reduced amount of collagen, but relapsing do not. These data confirm and extend the relevance of ECM and CAFs in priming resistance to BRAFV600E inhibition. Paradoxically, CAFs are activated by vemurafenib or its analogue PLX4720 and they produce hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which re&#8208;activates the MAPK signaling pathway, resulting in BRAF inhibition. This effect is reversed by blocking the HGF/MET axis (Straussman et&#160;al, 2012; Wilson et&#160;al, 2012). A second mechanism has been recently identified and demonstrates that the paradoxical activation of fibroblastic stroma triggered by PLX4720 modifies tumor stiffness, which provides an alternative route of MAPK activation by an integrin&#8208;mediated outside&#8208;in effect, resulting in cancer survival (Hirata et&#160;al, 2015).</text>

      <text>COMBO does not increase the expression of ECM degrading MMPs, but it reduces the expression of LOX, a key enzyme in the formation of collagen fibrils (Barker et&#160;al, 2012), supporting the notion that VEGF removal by bevacizumab can balance the effect of PLX4720 on ECM and its negative consequence on therapeutic response.</text>

      <text>However, other mechanisms could explain the effect of COMBO treatment on the fibroblast compartment. Interestingly, vascular normalization induced by the calcium antagonist verapamil with cilengitide, an integrin mimetic peptide, reduces ECM deposition and the desmoplastic reaction in a model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Wong et&#160;al, 2015).</text>

      <text>The effect of COMBO on ECM deposition can also affect the inflammatory response. For example, mice lacking the ECM glycoprotein SPARC have an increased number of macrophages in tumors (Puolakkainen et&#160;al, 2004). Additionally, collagen I has inhibitory effects on immune cells, attenuating their tumor&#8208;suppressive function. Collagen inhibits the ability of macrophages to kill cancer cells by blocking their polarization and activation (Kaplan, 1983). Collagen deposition in tumor microenvironment has also been directly implicated as a barrier to T&#8208;cell entry and subsequent cytotoxic activity (Salmon et&#160;al, 2012). Finally, LOX inhibition in transgenic mice developing pancreatic adenocarcinoma prolongs tumor&#8208;free survival and is associated with decreased fibrillar collagen and increased infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils (Miller et&#160;al, 2015). In general, strategies alleviating the forces that cause vessel compression improve perfusion and subsequent cell trafficking and delivery of drugs (Stylianopoulos &amp; Jain, 2013).</text>

      <text>The third neomorphic effect of COMBO concerns the ability of PLX4720 to modulate the effect of bevacizumab on blood vessels. Bevacizumab and, in general, all drugs targeting the VEGF/VEGF receptors axis reduce tumor capillaries by abrogating the pro&#8208;survival and proliferative effects of VEGF (Ferrara et&#160;al, 2003). In principle, drastic shrinkage of tumor vasculature promotes hypoxia, which can favor tumor progression in preclinical models (Ebos et&#160;al, 2009; Paez&#8208;Ribes et&#160;al, 2009). Based on our previous observations (Bottos et&#160;al, 2012), PLX4720 normalizes the tumor vasculature with a reduction in hypoxic areas and improves blood flow. These effects also persist in the presence of bevacizumab, which alone does not improve basal perfusion and tumor oxygenation. In accordance with these functional observations, PLX4720 and COMBO treatments result in decreased expression of genes regulating angiogenesis and the response to hypoxia.</text>

      <text>The vascular&#8208;normalizing effect of COMBO could function cooperatively with the above neomorphic effect on macrophage recruitment and indirectly favor the adaptive immune response. This hypothesis is supported by the evidences accumulated in responder and relapsing mice characterized by the correlation between the normoxic state and the abundance of TAMs. Substantial evidences suggest that the rescue of the hypoxic state by vascular perfusion reprograms the tumor microenvironment from immunosuppressive to immunosupportive. Vascular normalization facilitates the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells (Huang et&#160;al, 2012), and M2 and M1 polarizations are, respectively, promoted by hypoxia and normoxia (Casazza et&#160;al, 2013; Laoui et&#160;al, 2014). Hypoxia also recruits regulatory T&#8208;cell (Treg) effectors for tumor tolerance (Facciabene et&#160;al, 2011), and up&#8208;regulates the expression of programmed death (PD&#8208;1) ligand 1 (Noman et&#160;al, 2014), which favors the suppressive activity of MDSC (Greenwald et&#160;al, 2005). Among the immunosuppressive factors produced by tumor cells, VEGF plays a key role in suppressing dendritic cell maturation (Gabrilovich et&#160;al, 1996), thus impairing an effective tumor antigens presentation and the rise of specific antitumor immunity. VEGF promotes MDSC differentiation (Lechner et&#160;al, 2010) and regulatory T&#8208;cell proliferation (Terme et&#160;al, 2013). Then, FLT&#8208;1 expressing monocytes can be recruited by VEGF into the tumor (Mantovani &amp; Sica, 2009) and act together with the Th2 cytokine IL&#8208;4 to promote M2 polarization of macrophages (Linde et&#160;al, 2012). The immune&#8208;suppressive role of VEGF was further highlighted by the delayed melanoma growth observed after its silencing. VEGF down&#8208;modulation resulted in a decrease in Tregs and MDSC and an increased effector T&#8208;cell activation in tumor infiltrates. Together, these events restored tumor sensitivity to treatment with antibodies against the checkpoint inhibitors PD&#8208;1 and CTLA&#8208;4 (Courau et&#160;al, 2016).</text>

      <text>Our findings provide an intriguing experimental platform to explore possible synergism with immunotherapy strategies and support a previous study performed in mice transplanted with a BRAFV600E melanoma cell line poorly sensitive to PLX4720 (Knight et&#160;al, 2013). In this model, the BRAF inhibitor did not increase the tumor immunogenicity, but it favored the recruitment of CD8 and natural killer cells. PLX4720 treatment significantly reduces the production of tumoral VEGF, enhancing tumor infiltration by antigen&#8208;specific T lymphocytes (Liu et&#160;al, 2013). In general, contrasting the VEGF effect along with simultaneous BRAF inhibition can turn into a promotion of adaptive immune responses. From a clinical perspective of the treatment of BRAF&#8208;mutated melanomas, this synergism could be exploited with either immune&#8208;checkpoint modulators (Anti&#8208;PD1 Ab or Anti CTLA&#8208;4) (Postow et&#160;al, 2015) or with approaches based on adoptively transferred antitumor lymphocytes (Kwong et&#160;al, 2013). Antitumor T cells avoid hypoxic areas, and tissue oxygenation restores their activity and efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors (Hatfield et&#160;al, 2015). Interestingly, bevacizumab shows synergistic effect with ipilimumab, which blocks CTLA4, improving survival in patients with metastatic melanoma (Hodi et&#160;al, 2014). Therefore, our findings provide biologic strong rational to explore, within dedicated immunocompetent models, the potential beneficial modulation of antitumor adaptive immune response consequent to the double VEGF and BRAF inhibition.</text>

      <text>Our holistic experimental approach is poorly instructive on the molecular players involved by COMBO and on the cellular targets. However, bioinformatic predictions experimentally validated (Fig&#160;6) suggest that human TGF&#946;1 is one of the strong candidate to orchestrate the neomorphic effects of COMBO in A375 xenografts. Actually, the pleiotrophic roles of TGF&#946;1 include the suppressive activity (Yang et&#160;al, 2010), the capability to promote CAF differentiation and ECM remodeling (Evans et&#160;al, 2003; Shukla et&#160;al, 2014), and the vascular regulatory functions (Jakobsson &amp; van Meeteren, 2013). On the basis of the differential transcriptomic effects of bevacizumab and PLX4720 alone, we can predict that bevacizumab has an exclusive effect on stroma. However, PLX4720 has a wider effect on both tumor and stromal cells, as also reported by the literature (Straussman et&#160;al, 2012, Wilson et&#160;al, 2012; Hirata et&#160;al, 2015).</text>

      <text>Overall, our data suggest that in preclinical models the removal of VEGF can increase the efficacy of BRAFV600E inhibitors by inducing vascular normalization, overcoming immune tolerance and modifying the role played by CAFs. Further experiments will be required to investigate how T and B cells, which are absent in CD1 mice used in this work, modify the functional performance of the association between BRAFV600E targeting and VEGF removal.</text>

The sections were then incubated with the appropriate fluorescence&#8208;conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa 647 or 488, Life Technologies), and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Life Technologies). The samples were mounted using fluorescent mounting medium (Dako). All immunofluorescence images were captured and analyzed using a Leica SPEII confocal laser&#8208;scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems). Image acquisition was performed maintaining the same laser power, gain, and offset settings. Multiple independent fields (15&#8211;20 for every sections; 20&#215; or 40&#215; magnification) per tumor section were randomly chosen and analyzed from at least three tumors for each experimental condition. Image quantification was performed using NIH ImageJ and expressed as the fluorescence area. The MVD and MVA were quantified by counting CD31+ vessels per mm2 and measuring the CD31+ area in the total field area. CD31+ vessels were hand traced using ImageJ image analysis software to calculate the lumen vessel perimeter and area. Perivascular pericyte coverage was quantified by double staining of CD31 and NG2. Cell apoptosis was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick&#8208;end labeling (TUNEL) assay (Roche) according to the manufacturer's specifications and by M30 CytoDEATH antibody (Roche), which recognizes a cytokeratin 18&#8208;specific cleavage product of the caspase cascade.

      <text>For gene expression profiling analysis, 300&#160;ng of total RNA was amplified and labeled using an Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (Life Technologies). A total of 750&#160;ng of 1,500&#160;ng of labeled cRNA probes was hybridized on the HumanHT&#8208;12 v4.0 or MouseWG&#8208;6 v2.0 Expression Bead Chip, respectively (Illumina). All experiments were performed in biological triplicate (duplicate for COMBO group). Cubic spline&#8208;normalized probe intensity data, together with detection P&#8208;values, were obtained using the GenomeStudio software V2011.01 (Illumina). We selected probes characterized by at least one experimental point having a detection P&#8208;value &lt;&#160;0.05. For each gene, we retained the associated probe with the largest mean expression value across all samples. The data were log2 transformed for all subsequent analyses. For each probe, the log2 signal in each sample was converted to the log2 ratio against the global average expression of that probe in all samples. The log2 ratio expression data were clustered and visualized using GEDAS software (Fu &amp; Medico, 2007). One&#8208;way ANOVA test and LIMMA (Smyth, 2005) were used to identify the modulated genes. For the ANOVA test, P&#8208;values were corrected for multiple testing using a Benjamini&#8211;Hochberg procedure (Benjamini &amp; Hochberg, 1995), and a cutoff of 0.1 for the false&#8208;discovery rate (FDR) was used to define differentially modulated genes across all four experimental conditions.

      <text>To evaluate the in&#160;vitro cytotoxic effect of the tumor cell population on A375 cells, the cells were infected with pLVX&#8208;ZsGreen1&#8208;N1 lentivirus (Clontech). Vector production was achieved in HEK&#8208;293T cells transfected with pLVX&#8208;ZsGreen1&#8208;N1 and packaging plasmids. Selection was achieved by a 24&#8208;h cell incubation with puromycin (2&#160;&#956;g/ml). Tumor cells (5&#160;&#215;&#160;104) recovered as described in the &#8220;Flow cytometry&#8221; section were co&#8208;cultured with Zs&#8208;green&#8208;A375 cells (5&#160;&#215;&#160;104) in 96&#8208;well plates (final volume, 70&#160;&#956;l). Fluorescence was recorded at day 0 and days 2 by fluorescence microscopy (Leica DMI3000B) and analyzed by NIH ImageJ software.</text>

      <text>In the last 20&#160;years, cancer treatment is significantly improved by the availability of drugs specifically targeting mutant oncogenes. However, the success of target therapies is usually dampened by the appearance of acquired resistance and disease relapse. More than half of melanomas are characterized by an activating BRAF mutation and transiently respond to BRAFV600E inhibitors, but almost all patients develop resistance to these agents and subsequently relapse. Therefore, there is a cogent clinical need to design new strategies to control and delay the onset of resistance.</text>

      <text>The results of clinical trials using anti&#8208;angiogenic regimens to restrain tumor progression have been somewhat disappointing. However, judicious inhibition of VEGF promotes vascular normalization and favors the delivery of small molecules to tumors. Therefore, a promising application of anti&#8208;angiogenic drugs is their combination with other therapeutic strategies. We tested a combination of bevacizumab and the vemurafenib analog PLX4720, which target BRAFV600E, and observed de novo transcriptional profile that sustains decrease of tumor hypoxia, accumulation of antitumor macrophages, and reduction in cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts. These unexpected effects delayed the onset of resistance to PLX4720.</text>

      <text>Our findings offer a new perspective for the management of clinical resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Furthermore, the observation that the association of BRAF inhibitors with bevacizumab elicits the recruitment of antitumor macrophages supports the concept of combining this strategy with immune&#8208;based therapies.</text>
