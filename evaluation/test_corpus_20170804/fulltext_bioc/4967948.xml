      <text>Retinoic acid&#8208;inducible gene I (RIG&#8208;I) and melanoma differentiation&#8208;associated gene 5 (MDA5) are cytoplasmic sensors crucial for recognizing different species of viral RNAs, which triggers the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory cytokines. Here, we identify RING finger protein 123 (RNF123) as a negative regulator of RIG&#8208;I and MDA5. Overexpression of RNF123 inhibits IFN&#8208;&#946; production triggered by Sendai virus (SeV) and encephalomyocarditis picornavirus (EMCV). Knockdown or knockout of endogenous RNF123 potentiates IFN&#8208;&#946; production triggered by SeV and EMCV, but not by the sensor of DNA viruses cGAS. RNF123 associates with RIG&#8208;I and MDA5 in both endogenous and exogenous cases in a viral infection&#8208;inducible manner. The SPRY and coiled&#8208;coil, but not the RING, domains of RNF123 are required for the inhibitory function. RNF123 interacts with the N&#8208;terminal CARD domains of RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 and competes with the downstream adaptor VISA/MAVS/IPS&#8208;1/Cardif for RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 CARD binding. These findings suggest that RNF123 functions as a novel inhibitor of innate antiviral signaling mediated by RIG&#8208;I and MDA5, a function that does not depend on its E3 ligase activity.</text>

      <text>The innate immune reactions against pathogens invasion are mediated by host pattern&#8208;recognition receptors, which include Toll&#8208;like receptors (TLRs), RIG&#8208;I&#8208;like receptors (RLRs), nucleotide&#8208;binding oligomerization domain&#8208;like receptors (NLRs), and C&#8208;type lectin receptors 1. The RLR family consisting of retinoic acid&#8208;inducible gene I (RIG&#8208;I), melanoma differentiation&#8208;associated gene 5 (MDA5), and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) functions as the cytosolic viral RNA sensor, giving rise to downstream signals. Activated transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor&#8208;kappaB (NF&#8208;&#954;B) collaborate to trigger the transcription of type I interferons (IFNs) and pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to the host antiviral immune responses 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. RIG&#8208;I and MDA5 identify different RNA viruses. RIG&#8208;I recognizes Sendai virus (SeV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and vesicular stomatitis virus, whereas MDA5 responds to encephalomyocarditis picornavirus (EMCV) 3, 4. However, LGP2 is reported to play different regulatory roles in RIG&#8208;I or MDA5 signaling 7, 8.</text>

      <text>RIG&#8208;I and MDA5 contain an intensively conserved domain structure including two caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) at the N&#8208;terminus, which mediate signaling to downstream adaptors, a DExD&#8208;box RNA helicase domain and a C&#8208;terminal domain (CTD), which is also known as the repressor domains 8, 9. Once the CTD recognizes viral RNA, RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 changes conformation to expose the CARDs, which combine with mitochondrial adaptor VISA/MAVS/IPS&#8208;I/Cardif 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. This interaction triggers the aggregation of VISA (virus&#8208;induced signaling adaptor) 16 and then activates the TBK1 and TAK1 kinases. TBK1 (TANK&#8208;binding kinase 1) phosphorylates the transcription factor IRF3, causing IRF3 dimerization and translocation to promote the transcription of IFNs. However, TAK1 (TGF&#946;&#8208;activated kinase 1) phosphorylates I&#954;B kinase (IKK) which activates the transcription factor NF&#8208;&#954;B to induce the transcription of inflammatory cytokines 17, 18.</text>

      <text>Recently, cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS) has been determined as a cytosolic viral DNA sensor 19, 20, 21. cGAS could recognize the viral DNA and synthesize cGAMP using cellular GTP and ATP 22, 23. Binding with cGAMP, the adaptor STING (stimulator of interferon genes) recruits TBK1 and IRF3, which activates the transcription of IFNs 24, 25.</text>

      <text>To prevent the excessive outcomes of immune responses, the activation procedure of RIG&#8208;I and MDA5 should be strictly controlled. Previous studies have suggested that RIG&#8208;I controls its basal activity by autoinhibition. Upon viral infection, the double&#8208;stranded viral RNA which contains 5&#8242; triphosphate can be recognized by RIG&#8208;I and induce a conformational change of RIG&#8208;I to expose the CARDs to downstream adaptor proteins 10, 11. Protein modifications and the competitive combination are also indispensable for regulating the activity of RIG&#8208;I and MDA5. The E3 ubiquitin ligases TRIM25 and REUL/Riplet independently catalyze the Lys63 (K63) polyubiquitination and activation of RIG&#8208;I 26, 27, 28, 29, whereas RNF125 mediates the Lys48 (K48) polyubiquitination and degradation of RIG&#8208;I and MDA5 by proteasome 30; CYLD, which has been deemed as deubiquitinating enzyme, could negatively regulate RIG&#8208;I&#8208;mediated signaling, whereas another deubiquitinating enzyme USP17 plays a positive role in regulating RLR signaling 31, 32. The regulators of the autophagy, Atg5&#8211;Atg12 conjugate, inhibit RIG&#8208;I signaling via direct interaction with the CARD domain of RIG&#8208;I and VISA 33.</text>

      <text>In the present study, we performed a yeast two&#8208;hybrid screen and received a RING finger protein, RNF123, as a novel RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 interactor. RNF123 is also known as KPC1, which is demonstrated to be a component of the Kip1 ubiquitination&#8208;promoting complex (KPC) heterodimer. The other component is KPC2 (UBAC1). The KPC promotes the degradation of P27Kip1 which is the cyclin&#8208;dependent kinase inhibitor at the G0&#8211;G1 transition of the cell cycle. In this case, as an ubiquitin ligase, RNF123 recognizes and mediates the ubiquitination of P27, while KPC2 interacts with ubiquitinated P27 to promote its degradation in the proteasome 34, 35, 36. Recently, it has been reported that RNF123 mediated ubiquitination and degradation of NF&#8208;&#954;B1 (p105) leading to repression of tumor growth 37. Therefore, we set out to determine whether RNF123 functions as an important regulatory factor in antiviral innate immune responses and whether the E3 ligase activity of RNF123 is required for its regulatory action. Our results assign a function in RLR&#8208;mediated antiviral signaling to human RNF123 and highlight the emerging importance of a catalysis&#8208;independent role for RING finger family proteins.</text>

      <text>MDA5 is a RLR family member responding to certain kinds of RNA viruses like EMCV. It has not been sufficiently characterized how activation of MDA5 is regulated. We set out to identify MDA5 interactors by performing yeast two&#8208;hybrid screens with the MDA5 CARD as the bait. A RING finger protein RNF123, which has been reported to be an E3 ligase of P27, was identified in the human fetal kidney cDNA library. We first determined whether RNF123 influences RNA virus&#8208;induced responses. In luciferase reporter assays, overexpression of RNF123 apparently reduced SeV&#8208; and EMCV&#8208;induced activation of the IFN&#8208;&#946; promoter in HEK293T cells. As a control, RNF123 had no effect on the overexpression of the cGAS&#8208; and STING&#8208;induced activation of the IFN&#8208;&#946; promoter (Fig 1A). We also found that overexpression of RNF123 markedly decreased SeV&#8208;induced, but not the cGAS&#8208; and STING&#8208;induced, activation of the NF&#8208;&#954;B promoter (Fig 1B).</text>

      <text>To confirm that endogenous RNF123 plays a role in anti&#8208;RNA virus signaling, we generated stable RNF123&#8208;knockdown cell pools using shRNA plasmids that targeted four sites on human RNF123 mRNA. Two shRNA plasmids (#3 and #4) markedly reduced the RNF123 mRNA level in HEK293T cells, while the #1 and #2 shRNA plasmids had no apparent effect (Fig 2A). In reporter assays, the knocking down of RNF123 (by #3 and #4) potentiated activation of the IFN&#8208;&#946; and NF&#8208;&#954;B promoters induced by SeV and EMCV but not by cGAS and STING, whereas #1 and #2 had no evident effect (Fig 2B and C). Knockdown of RNF123 accordingly leaded to improved transcription of endogenous IFN&#8208;&#946; and RANTES induced by SeV or EMCV infection in RT&#8211;PCR experiments (Fig 2D), and qPCR experiments confirmed this quantitatively (Fig 2E).</text>

      <text>Next, we determined whether endogenous RNF123 is involved in cellular anti&#8208;RNA virus responses. Upon infecting with NDV&#8208;eGFP, the HEK293T cells knocking down RNF123 were resistant to NDV infection, and the amount of NDV&#8208;eGFP&#8208;positive cells was apparently decreased (Fig 2H). Knockdown of endogenous RNF123 in HeLa cells also reduced the replication of EMCV (Fig EV1D). The above results suggested that RNF123 negatively regulated cellular antiviral response induced by RNA viruses.</text>

      <text>To further determine the function of RNF123, we generated RNF123&#8208;knockout HEK293T cell line using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (Fig 3A). Consistent with knockdown results, depletion of RNF123 more significantly potentiated activation of the IFN&#8208;&#946; promoter induced by SeV and EMCV, but not by cGAS and STING, whereas reconstitution of RNF123 could in turn dampened activation of IFN&#8208;&#946; promoter (Fig 3B). RNF123 knockout also resulted in apparently improved transcription and secretion of endogenous IFN&#8208;&#946; upon SeV and EMCV infection (Fig 3C and D). These results confirmed that RNF123 plays an inhibitory role in IFN&#8208;&#946; induction by RNA viruses.</text>

      <text>We further identified the molecular targets of RNF123 in the anti&#8208;RNA virus signaling pathway. In reporter assays, we found that overexpressed RNF123 dose dependently inhibited the activation of IFN&#8208;&#946; and NF&#8208;&#954;B promoters induced by full&#8208;length RIG&#8208;I, the CARD of RIG&#8208;I, and the CARD of MDA5 (Fig 4A and B). We also found that RNF123 partly reduced the VISA&#8208;induced activation of the IFN&#8208;&#946; and NF&#8208;&#954;B promoters, but did not inhibit TBK1 and constitutively activated IRF3&#8208;5D&#8208;induced activation of the IFN&#8208;&#946; promoter, and also had no influence on activation of the NF&#8208;&#954;B promoter induced by TAB2 or IKK&#946; (Fig 4A and B). Consistently, RNF123 knockdown in 293T cells potentiated the IFN&#8208;&#946; promoter activation triggered by overexpression of RIG&#8208;I, RIG&#8208;I CARD, MDA5, and MDA5 CARD, but not by overexpression of VISA, TBK1, and cGAS/STING (Fig 4C), suggesting that RNF123 may target RIG&#8208;I and MDA5 in the RLR signaling pathway.</text>

      <text>We further determined whether RNF123 associates with RIG&#8208;I and MDA5 in physiological conditions and whether RNA virus infection has the effect on the interaction, by performing co&#8208;immunoprecipitation with the anti&#8208;RNF123 antibody in HEK293T and HeLa cells. The co&#8208;immunoprecipitation results showed that endogenous RIG&#8208;I interacted very weakly with endogenous RNF123 in unstimulated HEK293T cells. However, a distinct binding appeared at 9 h and was greatly enhanced at 18 h after SeV infection, and this phenomenon was partly due to the inducible expression of RIG&#8208;I (Fig 4E). In HeLa cells, we found that endogenous MDA5 had a weak interaction with RNF123, and this was enhanced upon EMCV stimulation (Fig 4F). These results suggested that RNF123 associates with RIG&#8208;I or MDA5 in a viral infection&#8208;inducible manner.</text>

      <text>We next use immunofluorescence to identify the distribution of RNF123 in HeLa cells, and we found that the overexpressed and endogenous RNF123 was dispersively localized in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells, which was similar to the distribution pattern of RIG&#8208;I and MDA5 but not VISA (Fig 4G and H). Double immunofluorescence staining showed that the overexpressed and endogenous RNF123 overlapped with RIG&#8208;I and MDA5, while there was no co&#8208;localization between RNF123 and VISA (Fig 4G and H). We also detected their localizations with SeV or EMCV infection and obtained similar results (Fig EV2A and B).

      <text>Since RNF123 has been reported to be an E3 ligase of p27 and NF&#8208;&#954;B1 (p105) 34, 37, we further clarified whether the E3 ligase activity is required for inhibiting RIG&#8208;I and MDA5. RNF123 contains an N&#8208;terminal SPRY domain, two coiled&#8208;coil domains in the middle, and a C&#8208;terminal RING finger domain 34 (Fig 5A). To determine which domain is crucial for its inhibitory function, we constructed RNF123 deletion mutants. In reporter assays, the truncation carrying the SPRY domain and two coiled&#8208;coil domains (residues 1&#8211;1,041) evidently suppressed activation of the IFN&#8208;&#946; promoter induced by RIG&#8208;I CARD and MDA5 CARD as well as full&#8208;length RNF123, while the truncations carrying the SPRY, coiled&#8208;coil, or the RING domain alone had no inhibitory effect (Fig 5B). These results indicated that the SPRY and coiled&#8208;coil domains are both indispensable for the inhibitory action of RNF123, and the RING domain is not required. Co&#8208;immunoprecipitation analysis also showed that the truncation carrying the SPRY domain and two coiled&#8208;coil domains interacted with RIG&#8208;I CARD, while the other truncations did not (Fig 5C), confirming that the RING domain is not necessary for the interaction with RIG&#8208;I. Above results suggested that the RING domain of RNF123 is not required for the negative regulatory function in RLR signaling.</text>

      <text>Previous studies have suggested that RNF123 requires a cofactor called KPC2 which together with RNF123 (also called KPC1) forms the active ubiquitin ligase complex KPC, promoting P27 degradation at the G1 phase of the cell cycle 34, 35, 36. We therefore tested whether KPC2 is involved in the inhibitory function of RNF123. In reporter assays, overexpression of KPC2 alone in HEK293T cells had no evident effect on the activation of the IFN&#8208;&#946; promoter induced by RIG&#8208;I CARD and MDA5 CARD, and co&#8208;transfection with RNF123 and KPC2 had the same inhibitory effect as RNF123 transfection alone (Fig 5D). To further determine the function of KPC2 in RLR signaling, we knocked down endogenous KPC2 expression in HEK293T cells using lentivirus&#8208;delivered shRNAs. As shown by the mRNA levels, two shRNAs (KPC2 shRNA #2 and #4) inhibited KPC2 expression comparing with shRNA control (GFPsh) (Fig 5E). We found that KPC2 depletion did not influence on SeV&#8208;induced activation of the IFN&#8208;&#946; promoter, nor influence the inhibitory action of overexpressed RNF123 (Fig 5F). Knockdown of KPC2 also did not impact the transcription of endogenous IFN&#8208;&#946; induced by SeV infection (Fig 5G). All the results indicated that KPC2 is not required for the inhibitory function of RNF123 in RLR signaling.</text>

      <text>RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 contains a conserved domain structure including a CARD domain at the N&#8208;terminus, a DExD&#8208;box RNA helicase domain, and a CTD. To further detect which domain of RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 is important for the interaction with RNF123, we co&#8208;transfected full&#8208;length (FL) or deletion mutants of RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 with RNF123 and performed co&#8208;immunoprecipitation assays. We found that RNF123 interacted with the RIG&#8208;I CARD or MDA5 CARD as well as RIG&#8208;I&#8208;FL or MDA5&#8208;FL, but it did not interact with the CARD deletion mutants of RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 (Fig 6A and B). We further found that the association between RNF123 and RIG&#8208;I CARD was enhanced by infection with SeV (Fig 6C). Above results suggested that RNF123 suppressed RNA virus&#8208;induced responses by binding with the CARDs of RIG&#8208;I/MDA5.</text>

      <text>Knockdown of RNF123 facilitates the endogenous interaction between RIG&#8208;I (G)/MDA5 (H) and VISA. Stable HEK293T (G)/HeLa (H) cells with GFPsh or RNF123 shRNA were treated with SeV (G)/EMCV (H) for the indicated times. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti&#8208;VISA antibody.

      <text>It was known RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 CARD interacts with the VISA CARD to send signals downstream. We then predicted that RNF123 may impede the binding of RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 CARDs with VISA. In the co&#8208;immunoprecipitation assays, we found that the association of the RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 CARDs with VISA was markedly reduced when overexpression of RNF123 in HEK293T cells (Fig 6D and E). As a negative control, RNF123 did not influence the interaction between the RIG&#8208;I CARD and E3 ligase REUL, which is reported to associate with CARD of RIG&#8208;I (Fig 6F).</text>

      <text>Then, we determined whether the endogenous interaction between RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 and VISA is enhanced when endogenous RNF123 is knocked down. We found that the endogenous interaction between RIG&#8208;I and VISA induced by SeV infection was intensely increased in RNF123&#8208;knockdown HEK293T cells (Fig 6G). Similar results were obtained in EMCV&#8208;infected HeLa cells. The endogenous binding of MDA5 with VISA was also raised when RNF123 was knocked down (Fig 6H). Collectively, these data suggested that RNF123 inhibits the SeV&#8208; and EMCV&#8208;induced interaction between RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 and VISA.</text>

      <text>Type I IFNs have a broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral activity. However, the induction of IFNs must be accurately regulated; otherwise, it will result in inflammatory and autoimmune disease. A host of molecules has been shown as a positive or negative regulator of type I IFN induction by targeting RIG&#8208;I and MDA5, which are crucial cytosolic RNA sensors. For example, TRIM25 and REUL/Riplet, which are both E3 ubiquitin ligase of RIG&#8208;I, could catalyze lysine 63 (K63) ubiquitin ligation and specifically strengthen RIG&#8208;I&#8208;mediated signaling, while the E3 ligase RNF125 promotes RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 proteasomal degradation by conjugating K48 ubiquitin 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. ARF&#8208;like protein 16 suppresses the association between RIG&#8208;I and RNA by means of binding with the CTD of RIG&#8208;I 38. SEC14L1 could negatively regulate RIG&#8208;I through an inhibiting association of RIG&#8208;I with VISA 39. RIG&#8208;I activity could also be regulated by phosphorylation or dephosphorylation. For example, protein kinase C &#945;/&#946; (PKC &#945;/&#946;) induces serine 8 phosphorylation at RIG&#8208;I CARD, and casein kinase (CK2) phosphorylates the CTD of RIG&#8208;I, which could strongly inhibit virus&#8208;induced production of IFN&#8208;&#946; 40, 41, 42, whereas the primary phosphatases PP1&#945; and PP1&#947; could activate MDA5/RIG&#8208;I via dephosphorylating them upon viral infection 43. RAVERI specifically enhances the recognition of MDA5 and its upstream ligands 44. And PIAS2&#946;, which specifically SUMOylates MDA5, enhances the activation of MDA5 as well as the production of IFN&#8208;&#946; 45.</text>

      <text>With this research, we identified a RING finger family member RNF123 through a yeast two&#8208;hybrid screen. Overexpression of RNF123 inhibited SeV&#8208; and EMCV&#8208;triggered IFN&#8208;&#946; production, while enhanced replication of RNA viruses. Knockdown or knockout of endogenous RNF123 facilitated SeV&#8208; and EMCV&#8208;induced IFN&#8208;&#946; expression and inhibited EMCV and NDV replication in HEK293T and HeLa cells. The binding of RNF123 with the N&#8208;terminal CARDs of RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 depressed the interaction between RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 and VISA in both endogenous and exogenous situations. These results illustrated that RNF123 is a novel suppressor of RIG&#8208;I and MDA5.</text>

      <text>In reporter assays, we also found that IFN&#8208;&#946; and NF&#8208;&#954;B promoters induced by VISA could be partly inhibited by overexpression of RNF123 (Fig 4A and B). Even so we do not consider VISA is the regulatory target of RNF123, because the knockdown of endogenous RNF123 specifically improved the activation of the IFN&#8208;&#946; promoters induced by RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 instead of VISA. Co&#8208;immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that RIG&#8208;I and MDA5, but not VISA, associated with RNF123 (Fig 4D). It was also revealed through double immunofluorescence staining that overexpressed or endogenous RNF123 had a similar localization pattern with RIG&#8208;I and MDA5, while it had no overlap with VISA (Fig 4G and H). All these data confirmed that RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 are the major regulatory targets of RNF123 although we could not completely eliminate the possibility that RNF123 also has an impact on VISA.</text>

      <text>Previous studies have shown that KPC (Kip1 ubiquitination&#8208;promoting complex), which consists of KPC1 (RNF123) and KPC2, ubiquitinates p27, and promotes its degradation 34, 35. In the capacity of an E3 ligase, RNF123 has also been reported to mediate the degradation of heterochromatin proteins 1&#945; and &#946; upon lamin A/C knockdown 46. Recently, it was reported that the RNF123 could ubiquitinate NF&#8208;&#954;B1 (p105) and mediate its proteasomal processing to p50 37. And another study showed that RKP, which is a homologue of RNF123 in plant cells, has an effect on plant virus infection through regulating the plant cell cycle 47. These findings suggested that RNF123 participates in the regulation of the immune system. Our research indicated a novel innate immune function for RNF123, which plays a negative role in RIG&#8208;I&#8208;/MDA5&#8208;mediated signaling and the anti&#8208;RNA viral response.</text>

      <text>We also revealed a different means by which RNF123 plays its role. Our data demonstrated that the RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 CARD&#8208;induced activation of the IFN&#8208;&#946; promoter can still be suppressed through deletion of the RING domain (Fig 4B). On the contrary, the SPRY and two coiled&#8208;coil domains played vital roles in the association with RIG&#8208;I and the inhibition. These suggested the E3 ligase activity of RNF123 is not necessary for its inhibitory action. The other conclusion was that the inhibitory action of RNF123 on RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 does not rely on KPC2, which is an E3 ligase cofactor. We found that KPC2 depletion did not make a difference in SeV&#8208;induced activation of the IFN&#8208;&#946; promoter; neither did it influence the inhibitory function of overexpressed RNF123 (Fig 4F). This is an instance of RNF123 performing an inhibitory function alone.</text>

      <text>However, we are still not clear about the mechanism that triggers the interaction between RNF123 and RLR CARDs. We observed that the interaction between endogenous RNF123 and RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 was enhanced after SeV/EMCV infection (Fig 4E and F). And the association of overexpressed RNF123 with RIG&#8208;I CARDs also improved upon SeV infection (Fig 6C). As we did not found obvious changes in the distribution pattern of RNF123 with SeV or EMCV infection (Figs 4G and H, and EV2A and B), we speculated that there were conformational changes or modifications of the RNF123 upon RNA virus infection, and these changes would improve the interaction between RNF123 and RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 CARDs. These speculations deserve further identify, especially using mass spectrography.</text>

      <text>As RNF123 works with an inhibitory function in the RLR signaling pathway in human cells, we investigated whether it has an analogous effect in mouse cells. We knocked down endogenous RNF123 expression in L929 cells, employing mouse RNF123 shRNAs. To our surprise, we found that the mRNF123 knockdown did not affect the expression of endogenous IFN&#8208;&#946; induced by SeV infection (Fig EV3A and B). We also generated a stable RNF123&#8208;knockdown pool of Raw264.7 cells and obtained similar results (Fig EV3C and D). These data suggested that RNF123 does not inhibit RIG&#8208;I/MDA5&#8208;induced anti&#8208;virus signaling in mouse cells. Therefore, we suspected that mRNF123 did not interact with mRIG&#8208;I. So we transfected HEK293T cells with the expression plasmids of HA&#8208;tagged mRNF123 and Flag&#8208;tagged mRIG&#8208;I and performed co&#8208;immunoprecipitation experiments. Unexpectedly, the results showed that mRNF123 still associated with mRIG&#8208;I, while as a negative control, mRNF123 had no interaction with mcGAS (Fig EV3E). So far, we have still not found the reasons for this phenomenon. We suspect that in mouse cells, there may exist a homologous molecule that plays a role redundant with RNF123. The answers to questions above may favor to the further identification of the functions of RNF123 and the regulatory mechanisms of the innate immune response.</text>

      <text>The plasmids which encode lentiviruses expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) (Sigma&#8208;Aldrich) were transfected into HEK293T cells with a three&#8208;plasmid system to produce lentivirus. The following shRNAs were used: hRNF123sh #1 (TRCN0000033894), hRNF123sh #2 (TRCN0000033895), hRNF123sh #3 (TRCN0000033896), hRNF123sh #4 (TRCN0000033897), hKPC2sh #1 (TRCN0000034264), hKPC2sh #2 (TRCN0000034265), hKPC2sh #3 (TRCN0000034266), hKPC2sh #4 (TRCN0000034267), hKPC2sh #5 (TRCN0000034268), mRNF123sh (TRCN0000190349) #1, mRNF123sh (TRCN0000217438) #2, and the control hairpin GFPsh. HEK293T, HeLa cells, L929 cells, or Raw264.7 cells which were seeded onto 6&#8208;well plates were cultured with 2 ml complete medium. After 18 h, 1 ml indicated lentivirus supernatant was added with 8 &#956;g/ml polybrene. After 48&#8208;h incubation, the cells were treated with 10 mg/ml puromycin for 72 h, and then they were collected for Western blot analysis.</text>

      <text>The lentiCRISPRv1 (Addgene Plasmid #49535) vector was engineered to express a guide RNA targeting RNF123 (5&#8242;&#8208;ACATTTGGACCAGTTGCTAC&#8208;3&#8242;) by standard techniques. For transfection, HEK293T cells were plated at 6 &#215; 105 cells per well in a 6&#8208;well plate and transfected with lentiCRISPR&#8208;based plasmid. At 36 h post&#8208;transfection, cells were split with DMEM containing 0.5 &#956;g/ml puromycin and selected for 7 days. Single clones were isolated. Gene knockout was assessed by Western blot analysis using the anti&#8208;RNF123 antibody.</text>
