      <text>In a number of human cancers, NTN1 upregulation inhibits apoptosis induced by its so&#8208;called dependence receptors DCC and UNC5H, thus promoting tumor progression. In other cancers however, the selective inhibition of this dependence receptor death pathway relies on the silencing of pro&#8208;apoptotic effector proteins. We show here that a substantial fraction of human breast tumors exhibits simultaneous DNA methylation&#8208;dependent loss of expression of NTN1 and of DAPK1, a serine threonine kinase known to transduce the netrin&#8208;1 dependence receptor pro&#8208;apoptotic pathway. The inhibition of DNA methylation by drugs such as decitabine restores the expression of both NTN1 and DAPK1 in netrin&#8208;1&#8208;low cancer cells. Furthermore, a combination of decitabine with NTN1 silencing strategies or with an anti&#8208;netrin&#8208;1 neutralizing antibody potentiates tumor cell death and efficiently blocks tumor growth in different animal models. Thus, combining DNA methylation inhibitors with netrin&#8208;1 neutralizing agents may be a valuable strategy for combating cancer.</text>

      <text>Recent research focusing on a specific functional family of receptors, namely the dependence receptors (DRs) (Mehlen et&#160;al, 1998; Llambi et&#160;al, 2001), has highlighted their implication in inhibiting tumor progression. Indeed, in contrast to most cellular receptors, a dual role characterizes these transmembrane receptors: in the presence of their respective ligands, they provide a typical positive signal (promoting cell survival, migration, proliferation, etc.), while the absence of ligand triggers a cascade of signaling events leading to apoptotic cell death. The DR protein family currently contains approximately twenty known members, and one of their most exhaustively studied ligands is Netrin&#8208;1. This DR ligand was the first secreted attractive axon guidance cue to be described in the early nineties, since then, the role of netrin&#8208;1 in many biological functions has been established (Cirulli &amp; Yebra, 2007; Mehlen &amp; Guenebeaud, 2010; Ramkhelawon et&#160;al, 2014). Netrin&#8208;1 receptors, namely, are the Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma (DCC), the Uncoordinated&#8208;5&#8208;Homologs (UNC5H1&#8208;4/A&#8211;D). The ability of these receptors to trigger apoptosis in settings under ligand&#8208;limited conditions was shown to be a constrain for impede tumor progression. Indeed, the inactivation of UNC5C, and DCC, or the mutation of the DCC&#8208;inducing apoptosis domain is associated with tumor development and progression in mouse models (Bernet et&#160;al, 2007; Castets et&#160;al, 2012; Krimpenfort et&#160;al, 2012). Furthermore, in line with these observations, DCC and UNC5H are silenced in many cancers, either by loss of heterozygosity or epigenetic mechanisms (Hedrick et&#160;al, 1994; Bernet et&#160;al, 2007; Shin et&#160;al, 2007). Alternatively, in some types of cancers, an upregulation of NTN1 provides a similar tumor growth selective advantage by abolishing their dependency on netrin&#8208;1 availability in the micro&#8208;environment (Fitamant et&#160;al, 2008). This upregulation is particularly marked in some cases of aggressive breast cancer and in breast metastasis (Fitamant et&#160;al, 2008; Harter et&#160;al, 2014). The reliance on netrin&#8208;1 for tumor growth was rapidly perceived as an opportunity for therapeutic intervention, since it was speculated that the disruption of the binding of netrin&#8208;1 to its receptors should induce apoptotic cell death in&#160;vitro and tumor growth inhibition in&#160;vivo. Consistently, the silencing of netrin&#8208;1 or the development of biological agents interfering with netrin&#8208;1/DRs interactions has been shown to efficiently reduce tumor growth and metastasis in different animal models (Fitamant et&#160;al, 2008; Delloye&#8208;Bourgeois et&#160;al, 2009a,b; Paradisi et&#160;al, 2013; Grandin et&#160;al, 2016). Moreover, an anti&#8208;netrin&#8208;1 antibody is under preclinical evaluation and should be assessed in early clinical trials in 2016.</text>

      <text>Nevertheless, a substantial fraction of human tumors appears to conserve the expression of netrin&#8208;1 receptors without upregulating NTN1 expression, suggesting that the downstream DR pathways may be impaired (Shin et&#160;al, 2007; Mian et&#160;al, 2011; Krimpenfort et&#160;al, 2012). In cancers, epigenetic modifications are frequently associated with an increase in the expression of anti&#8208;apoptotic proteins and with the inactivation of factors inducing apoptosis (Baylin &amp; Ohm, 2006). In this context, previous studies have reported that DAPK1, a serine threonine kinase responsible for UNC5H&#8208;induced apoptosis, is downregulated in various cancers (Llambi et&#160;al, 2005; Guenebeaud et&#160;al, 2010). Furthermore, mechanistic analyses have demonstrated a direct relationship between the hypermethylation of the CpG island (CGi) located within the DAPK1 promoter region and its downregulation (Raval et&#160;al, 2007; Pulling et&#160;al, 2009; Mian et&#160;al, 2011; Kilinc et&#160;al, 2012). Finally, it was shown that treatment with decitabine (5&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytidine, DAC) inhibits the DNA methylation of the DAPK1 promoter and restores DAPK1 expression in lung cancer cell lines (Tang et&#160;al, 2004).</text>

      <text>Inhibition of DNA methylation may prove to be a promising approach for combating cancer (Yang et&#160;al, 2010; Rodriguez&#8208;Paredes &amp; Esteller, 2011a; Dawson &amp; Kouzarides, 2012; Tsai et&#160;al, 2012). Concordantly, DAC showed anti&#8208;leukemic effects in several clinical trials and has been approved by FDA for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and recent studies indicated that DAC shows some effects in preclinical models (Tsai et&#160;al, 2012). Here, we report that treatment with DAC restores the pro&#8208;apoptotic machinery linked to the netrin&#8208;1/DR&#8208;mediated cell death signaling pathway in breast cancer cell lines and patient&#8208;derived xenografts and sensitize cancer cells to netrin&#8208;1 neutralizing agents. We thus provide evidence that combining DNA methylation inhibitors with a netrin&#8208;1 neutralizing antibody empowers tumor cell death in&#160;vitro and tumor growth inhibition in mice.</text>

      <text>In order to study the mechanisms underlying inhibition of netrin&#8208;1/DRs&#8208;mediated apoptosis, which in a fraction of tumors is neither dependent on netrin&#8208;1 upregulation nor DR silencing, we investigated DAPK1 expression and DNA methylation in breast tumors.</text>

      <text>We thus examined differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with malignant transformation in breast cancer samples (n&#160;=&#160;92) available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) by comparing paired normal/tumoral data obtained from the HumanMethylation450K Array (HM450, Illumina) and by high&#8208;throughput sequencing of polyadenylated RNA (RNAseq). This comparison focused on the level of DNA methylation within the 5&#8242;&#8208;end of NTN1 (position &#8722;765 to +&#160;1,300 relative to the transcription start site, TSS) and DAPK1 (+&#160;365 and +&#160;838 relative to the TSS) and revealed that these regions were hypermethylated (threshold&#160;=&#160;2) in about 30% of tumoral samples compared with their normal counterparts (Fig&#160;1A and B). Furthermore, NTN1 was downregulated (Fig&#160;1C, fold change (FC)&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.5) in 43% of cases and the &#8220;NTN1&#8208;low&#8221; samples were hypermethylated (Fig&#160;1G; P&#160;=&#160;3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2, two&#8208;sided Mann&#8211;Whitney test) when compared with samples exhibiting no NTN1 downregulation (FC&#160;&#8805;&#160;1.3). Using the same approach for DAPK1, we observed that samples exhibiting DAPK1 downregulation (29% of the samples, Fig&#160;1D) were also hypermethylated (P&#160;=&#160;3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4) when compared with the other samples (Fig&#160;1H). These epigenetic modifications did not seem to be independent events since in NTN1&#8208;hypermethylated samples (n&#160;=&#160;23, FC &#8805;&#160;2), DAPK1 was also hypermethylated (mean FC&#160;=&#160;2.22), while in NTN1&#8208;hypomethylated samples (n&#160;=&#160;13, FC &lt;&#160;0.7), DAPK1 was not hypermethylated (mean FC&#160;=&#160;0.93). The relationship between DAPK1/NTN1 downregulation and DNA hypermethylation was also observed in a larger number of breast cancer samples (n&#160;=&#160;807) available on TCGA data portal. Indeed, the mean percentage of CpG methylation (Fig&#160;1E and F) of DAPK1 and NTN1 were inversely correlated with their levels of expression (Pearson's r&#160;=&#160;&#8722;0.32, P&#160;&lt;&#160;10&#8722;18 and Pearson's r&#160;=&#160;&#8722;0.14, P&#160;=&#160;6.7&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5, respectively), suggesting that DNA methylation represses DAPK1 and NTN1 transcription in human breast tumors.</text>

      <text>Although we cannot excluded a bias due to stromal contamination, it should be noted that, in paired samples, while hypermethylation was observed in tumoral tissues, very low levels of DNA methylation were measured in their normal counterparts (Fig&#160;1A and B). For both genes, a region (not represented on HM450) located at the 3&#8242;&#8208;end of the CGis (Fig&#160;2A, light gray boxes) was selected for the quantitative analysis of DNA methylation of breast cancer biopsies (tumor bank&#8212;Centre L&#233;on B&#233;rard) by bisulfite pyrosequencing. The analysis indicated that the mean percentage of CpG methylation of the DAPK1 and NTN1 pyrosequenced regions were inversely correlated (Pearson's r&#160;=&#160;&#8722;0.66, P&#160;=&#160;0.003, and Pearson's r&#160;=&#160;&#8722;0.55, P&#160;=&#160;0.008, respectively) with their levels of expression (Fig&#160;EV1A and B). Altogether, these data suggested that DNA methylation is involved in the downregulation of NTN1 and DAPK1 in human breast cancers.</text>

      <text>To determine whether this concomitant change in DAPK1 and NTN1 expression was also observed at the protein levels, DAPK1, UNC5B, and netrin&#8208;1 were measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using tissue microarrays (70 sections) from human breast ductal carcinoma (Super Bio Chips).

      <text>In order to establish an in&#160;vitro experimental model mimicking the DNA methylation alterations observed in breast cancer tissues, DNA methylation patterns of two cancer cell lines were determined by parallel sequencing. Pull&#8208;down assays were conducted using the MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cell line derived from human breast cancer, and the HMLER cell line generated through the in&#160;vitro transformation of human mammary cells (Elenbaas et&#160;al, 2001; Morel et&#160;al, 2008). Methylated DNA fragments were selected using a recombinant protein containing the Methyl&#8208;CpG&#8208;binding domain of MBD2 of MBD2 (Methyl&#8208;Cap&#8208;seq), from MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cell line derived from human breast cancer, and the HMLER cell line constructed from in&#160;vitro transformation of human mammary cells (Elenbaas et&#160;al, 2001; Morel et&#160;al, 2008). Data obtained indicated that the 5&#8242;&#8208;end CpGis of DAPK1 and NTN1 were methylated in the two cancer cell lines (Fig&#160;2A). Furthermore, the treatment of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and HMLER cells with decitabine (DAC) resulted in a significant upregulation of DAPK1 and NTN1 mRNA (Fig&#160;2B and C) and in the inhibition of DNA methylation within the DAPK1 and NTN1 promoter regions (Figs&#160;2D and E, and EV1F and G).</text>

      <text>Parallel sequencing of DMRs (Fig&#160;2A, dark gray boxes) validated their methylation status obtained from Methyl&#8208;Cap&#8208;seq experiments and indicated that DAC treatments reduced their level of methylation by half, in&#160;vitro (Fig&#160;2D and E). Of note, DAC treatment of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells resulted in the upregulation of UNC5B, although its promoter was not methylated in any of the cell lines tested (Fig&#160;2B and C), suggesting an indirect regulatory mechanism. However, this upregulation was not observed for the other netrin&#8208;1&#8208;specific receptors, UNC5A, UNC5C, and DCC (Fig&#160;EV2A and B). Altogether, these data strongly suggest that DNA hypermethylation is involved in the transcriptional silencing of DAPK1 and NTN1 in human breast cancer cells.</text>

      <text>We thus hypothesized that the pharmacological targeting of the DNA methylation machinery may restore functional netrin&#8208;1/DR pathways and resensitize netrin&#8208;1&#8208;low cells to netrin&#8208;1 interference. We investigated whether the forced expression of DAPK1 in the DAPK1&#8208;negative HMLER cells re&#8208;established pro&#8208;apoptotic pathways (Fig&#160;EV2C and D). As expected, an increase in caspase&#8208;3 activity was observed in DAPK1 transfected cells. Furthermore, this pro&#8208;apoptotic effect was partially reversed by adding recombinant netrin&#8208;1 (Fig&#160;EV2D). We next analyzed cell death by conducting viability assays and caspase&#8208;3 activity assays in HMLER cells transfected with NTN1 siRNA and treated with DAC. While transfections had a mild effect on HMLER cells per se, treatment with DAC strongly potentiated the netrin&#8208;1 deprivation&#8208;induced cell death (Fig&#160;EV2F&#8211;H).</text>

      <text>Keeping in mind the therapeutic perspective of our study, we assessed the effect of combining DAC with a human anti&#8208;netrin&#8208;1 antibody, net1&#8208;mAb (Grandin et&#160;al, 2016). MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and HMLER cells were treated with DAC or net1&#8208;mAb, or a combination of both drugs. As anticipated, the cell lines were resistant to net1&#8208;mAb alone, while, as previously observed (Lund et&#160;al, 2011) (Rodriguez&#8208;Paredes &amp; Esteller, 2011b), DAC induced cell death in most of the cells tested, as evidenced by DNA fragmentation (Figs&#160;3A and B, and EV2I and J) and viability assays (Fig&#160;3C). The addition of net1&#8208;mAb to DAC&#8208;treated cells significantly enhanced apoptosis (Fig&#160;3A&#8211;C). Moreover, this effect was blocked by the concomitant addition of recombinant netrin&#8208;1 (Fig&#160;3A&#8211;C), indicating that net1&#8208;mAb&#8208;induced cell death was specifically linked to netrin&#8208;1 neutralization. To confirm that the pro&#8208;apoptotic activity observed upon the combined net1&#8208;mAb and DAC treatment was not linked to an intrinsic property of DAC, MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and HMLER cell lines were treated with the 5&#8208;azacytidine (Aza), a DNA methylation inhibitor. This treatment resulted in similar gene expression modifications and cell death effects as DAC, when combined with the net1&#8208;mAb (Appendix&#160;Fig S1). The functional consequences of this combination treatment were also evaluated in additional human breast cancer cell lines. The highest upregulation of both NTN1 and DAPK1 was observed when treating cells with 10&#160;&#956;M of DAC (Fig&#160;EV3A&#8211;E), we thus used this concentration in the combined DAC and net1&#8208;mAb treatment to investigate the induction of apoptosis (Fig&#160;EV3F). A similar potentiation of cell death by combining DAC and net1&#8208;mAb was observed in cell lines (AU565, SKBR3, and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;157) exhibiting an upregulation of at least one of 3 genes, NTN1, UNC5B, or DAPK1 (Fig&#160;EV3C&#8211;E).</text>

Nude mice were engrafted with MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells in the mammary fat pad as an orthotopic site for breast cancer. When tumors were palpable (&#8776;100&#160;mm3), DAC was subcutaneously injected at a therapeutic dose (0.5&#160;mg/kg). Parallel sequencing of amplicons derived from DAPK1 and NTN1 CGis indicated that these genes were also hypomethylated (ranging from 5 to 27% depending of the CpG analyzed) in tumors from DAC&#8208;treated mice (Fig&#160;3D). Furthermore, we observed that DAC treatments were associated with the re&#8208;expression of DAPK1, netrin&#8208;1, and UNC5B by the IHC staining of tumor sections (Fig&#160;3E and F).</text>

      <text>To evaluate the effect on tumor growth, MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 orthotopic xenografts were performed, and mice were treated by intraperitoneal injections of net1&#8208;mAb, or subcutaneous injections of DAC, or a combination of both treatments for a period of 21&#160;days (Fig&#160;3G and H). While no significant difference was observed between the control groups and mice treated either with net1&#8208;mAb or DAC alone, the combination of both drugs strongly inhibited tumor growth (Fig&#160;3G) and led to a reduction in tumor weight (Fig&#160;3H). Furthermore, similar results were obtained using the NET1&#8208;mAb antibody, which is scheduled for human trials in&#160;2016 (Grandin et&#160;al, 2016) (Appendix&#160;Fig S2A). Interestingly, the&#160;inhibitory effect of the combined treatment on tumor growth was associated with a marked increase in tumor cell death (Appendix&#160;Fig S2B and C).</text>

      <text>To gain further insights into the mechanisms underlying the tumor suppressive activity of netrin&#8208;1 neutralization following DAC treatment, cancer cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis were analyzed in treated tumors. A small reduction in the proliferative rate (Ki67 staining) was determined in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 xenografts from mice treated with DAC; however, the differences between treated samples and controls were not statistically significant (Appendix&#160;Fig S3A and B). Staining of sections from MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 xenografts with an antibody directed against CD31 (also known as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule) revealed that the anti&#8208;netrin&#8208;1 antibody treatment led to a reduction in angiogenesis. This finding strengthens a previous report, which suggested the implication of netrin&#8208;1 during angiogenesis (Bongo &amp; Peng, 2014). However, no statistically significant differences were observed between mice treated with the anti&#8208;netrin&#8208;1 antibody alone, where no inhibition in tumor growth was detected, and the mice treated with a combination of DAC and net1&#8208;mAb, where tumor growth was profoundly affected (Appendix&#160;Fig S3A). Hence, the inhibitory effect of the combination of DAC and net1&#8208;mAb on tumor growth is likely related to their pro&#8208;apoptotic effects, rather than to a change in proliferation or in angiogenesis.</text>

Furthermore, IHC staining on tumor sections indicated that the combination treatment increased the apoptotic rate (Fig&#160;4D and E), while it was not correlated with tumor cell proliferation or angiogenesis (Appendix&#160;Fig S3C and D). Similarly to the data obtained in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 engrafted cells, the combined treatment reduced the growth of the PDX tumor when compared to the effects of monotherapies (Fig&#160;4F).</text>

When the tumors reached 120&#8211;150&#160;mm3, mice were injected subcutaneously with decitabine (0.4&#160;mg/kg) or PBS and/or intraperitoneally with net1&#8208;mAb (10&#160;mg/kg) or with a human IgG1 control isotype antibody (Ctrl IgG1, 10&#160;mg/kg) from day 1 to day 21. Tumor volumes were measured twice a week; n&#160;=&#160;7 mice per group. The statistical significance of the differences obtained between the DAC&#160;+&#160;Ctrl IgG1 group and the DAC&#160;+&#160;net1&#8208;mAb group was determined by two&#8208;way ANOVA2 and post hoc Tukey test, ****P&#160;&lt;&#160;0.0001.

      <text>The potential reversibility of epigenetic DNA modifications raised the possibility that inhibition of DNA methylation might induce the re&#8208;expression of these genes, and thus, resensitize cells to several pathways resulting in apoptosis. Therefore, we studied gene re&#8208;expression following DAC treatment in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and HMLER cell lines, by RNAseq. Indeed, the 626 upregulated genes upon DAC treatments (FC untreated/treated cells &gt;&#160;2) both in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and HMLER cells were investigated for their Gene Ontology term and their KEGG pathway contributions using the WEB&#8208;based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit (Wang et&#160;al, 2013). Enriched Gene Ontology terms were of various nature and included response to molecules of bacterial origin, response to lipopolysaccharide, biological regulation, cell proliferation, and cytokine activity. Enriched KEGG pathways included KEGG osteoclast differentiation, KEGG MAPK signaling pathway, KEGG rheumatoid arthritis, KEGG cytokine&#8211;cytokine receptor interaction, pathways in cancer, and NOD&#8208;like receptor signaling pathway (Appendix&#160;Fig S5). Genes upregulated upon DAC treatment were associated with many biological functions; however, the profiles of transcriptomic changes suggested that no other pro&#8208;apoptotic pathway participated in the synergistic effect of net1&#8208;mAb and DAC on cell death observed herein.</text>

      <text>It has been reported (Qi et&#160;al, 2015) that the addition of netrin&#8208;1 to the culture medium of human liver cancer, glioblastoma, and embryonic kidney cell lines induces the expression of the Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP), of TAZ, a transcriptional coactivator with a PDZ&#8208;binding motif (WWTR1), and of the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), the transcription of which is initiated by YAP/TAZ. The induction of YAP/TAZ following the addition netrin&#8208;1 was correlated with an increase in cell proliferation and following the addition of netrin&#8208;1 neutralization by specific antibodies, with a decrease in the proliferation and migration of the cell lines analyzed (Qi et&#160;al, 2015). Therefore, we verified whether, in DAC&#8208;treated cells, netrin&#8208;1 neutralization leads to the downregulation of the YAP/TAZ signaling pathway, which, in turn, could participate in the anti&#8208;tumoral effects associated with the combined treatment. The effect of the net1&#8208;mAb on the expression of YAP, TAZ, and CTGF, in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and HMLER cells treated with DAC, was thus investigated. In MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells, DAC treatment increased the level of TAZ and CTGF expression, while net1&#8208;mAb treatment only induced a slight increase in TAZ expression. In contrast, in HMLER cells, the addition of net1&#8208;mAb only induced the expression of CTGF in DAC&#8208;treated cells, while the expression of YAP and TAZ was not significantly modified (Appendix&#160;Fig S6A and B). Collectively, these observations did not seem to be in favor of major role of the YAP/TAZ&#8208;mediated signals in the response of cancer cells to the combined DAC/+net1&#8208;mAB treatment. In a similar context, p53 alterations were reported to cooperate with YAP signaling pathways during cancer cell proliferation (Di Agostino et&#160;al, 2016), raising the question of the implication of TP53 in the apoptotic effect observed. In the panel of cells analyzed, T47D cells exhibited no alteration in p53 and did not respond to the combined treatment (Fig&#160;EV3F), while other cell lines, mutated (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231), blocked (HMLER), or wild type (H460) responded to the combined DAC/+net1&#8208;mAb treatment (Grandin et&#160;al, 2016). Taken together, these data suggested that TP53 does not play a determinant role in the tumor growth inhibitory effect conferred by the combination treatment.</text>

      <text>Similarly to the data reported by Roulois et&#160;al (2015) in colorectal cancer cells, DAC treatment of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and HMLER cells induced the interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), a key player in the type I interferon (IFN)&#8208;dependent immune responses (Appendix&#160;Fig S6C and D). We thus investigated the effect of this transcriptional regulator on the expression of DAPK1, NTN1, or UNC5B upon DAC treatment in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and HMLER cells. The transient transfection of these two cell lines with a siRNA targeting IRF7 strongly reduced IRF7 expression and prevented its upregulation upon DAC treatment (Appendix&#160;Fig S6C and D). However, IRF7 mRNA depletion failed to abrogate DAC induction of DAPK1, NTN1, and UNC5B upregulation, suggesting that IRF7 and more generally the interferon (IFN)&#8208;like response is not implicated in regulating the expression of these genes following DAC treatment.</text>

      <text>Our final working hypothesis was, therefore, that the tumor growth inhibitory effects conferred by the combination treatment were mediated through the pro&#8208;apoptotic DR pathway. To validate this hypothesis, we generated MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells stably expressing shRNAs targeting DAPK1, NTN1, or UNC5B transcripts. qRT&#8211;PCR analyses indicated that the DAC&#8208;induced expression of DAPK1, NTN1, and UNC5B was efficiently counteracted by gene silencing in the corresponding MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231&#8208;shDAPK1, MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231&#8208;shNTN1, and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231&#8208;shUNC5B cells (Fig&#160;EV4A). We then investigated the responses of the MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231&#8208;shRNA cells, when engrafted in mammary fat pad and treated or not with the combination treatment (DAC and the net1&#8208;mAb). After validating the levels of DAPK1, UNC5B, and netrin&#8208;1 by IHC (Fig&#160;EV4B&#8211;D), anti&#8208;active caspase&#8208;3 IHC staining was performed on tumor sections and revealed that the silencing of DAPK1 or UNC5B fully prevents the activation of caspase&#8208;3 mediated by the combination treatment, while DAC monotherapy resulted in a marked increase in caspase&#8208;3 activity when NTN1 was silenced. Furthermore, the silencing of DAPK1 or UNC5B mRNA prevented the inhibition of tumor growth induced by the combination treatment, further confirming our working hypothesis (Fig&#160;5A&#8211;C). Moreover, NTN1 silencing was sufficient to induce tumor growth inhibition following DAC monotherapy (Fig&#160;5D). Taken together, these data demonstrate that DAPK1 and UNC5B are the key players involved in the response to the combined DAC and the anti&#8208;netrin&#8208;1 antibody treatment.</text>

      <text>The results presented herein provide a proof of concept that inhibition of DNA methylation can sensitize solid tumors to antibodies mediating tumor cell apoptosis. We previously proposed that in netrin&#8208;1&#8208;low tumors, inhibition of the netrin&#8208;1 dependence receptor (DR) pathway may occur either through the downregulation of the receptors or of key signaling pathway partners in colorectal cancer and neuroblastoma (Bernet et&#160;al, 2007; Zhu et&#160;al, 2013). Interestingly, in the panel of breast cancers analyzed in the current study, low levels of NTN1 expression are associated with the hypermethylation of the CpG island located in the 5&#8242;&#8208;end of this gene. Furthermore, this correlation between hypermethylation and gene silencing was also found for DAPK1, an essential partner in the apoptotic netrin&#8208;1/DR pathway. These features were confirmed in breast cancer cell lines, since NTN1 was downregulated and methylated in HMLER and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells, and DAPK1 was methylated and downregulated in HMLER cells.</text>

      <text>In addition we showed, both in&#160;vitro and in xenograft models, that combining inhibition of DNA methylation with an anti&#8208;netrin&#8208;1 antibody resulted in the re&#8208;expression of netrin&#8208;1 and DAPK1 and led to tumor cell death and tumor growth inhibition. The correlation between NTN1 and DAPK1 silencing and DNA hypermethylation does not exclude that their upregulation in DAC&#8208;treated cells might be dependent on additional factors. For example, UNC5B, while unmethylated, was upregulated in DAC&#8208;treated MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells, and it was previously shown that in breast cancer cells, the downregulation of some methylated genes is dependent on the deposition of the methyl&#8208;CpG binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) within their promoter sequence (Devailly et&#160;al, 2015).</text>

      <text>It is intriguing that, in the PDX model, the administration of DAC as a monotherapy only resulted in a slight tumor growth inhibitory effect. It is unlikely that the resistance to DAC treatment, used as a monotherapeutic agent, may have resulted from an over&#8208; or under&#8208;dosage, since several reports have shown that similar DAC doses are efficient in reducing tumor formation in some mouse models, including ApcMin&#8208;induced intestinal neoplasia (Tsai et&#160;al, 2012), HRAS&#8208;G12V&#8208;transformed human epithelial kidney, leukemic cells, breast cancer cell lines, and engrafted patient&#8208;derived tumors (Mian et&#160;al, 2011; Kilinc et&#160;al, 2012). Furthermore, DNA hypomethylation was observed following DAC treatment in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 xenograft tumors and PDX, indicating that DNA methylation was efficiently inhibited by DAC, in&#160;vivo. Alternatively, these data would suggest that tumor&#8208;growing conditions can overcome, at least partially, the anti&#8208;tumor effect of DAC. Experimental approaches (Rodriguez&#8208;Paredes &amp; Esteller, 2011b; Yang et&#160;al, 2012; Azad et&#160;al, 2013) and clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) using combinations of DAC with other epigenetic modifiers and/or cytotoxic agents provide interesting strategies for tumor growth reduction. However, these approaches have overlooked an important aspect of DAC, which is the re&#8208;expression of potentially masked targets and pathways. The data reported here provide not only evidence for the importance of ligand/DRs pairs in the regulation of tumor development but also advocate a new strategy based on the specific targeting of genes re&#8208;expressed following a DNA hypomethylating treatment. Finally, inhibitors of DNA methylation could &#8220;prime&#8221; tumors to netrin&#8208;1 addiction, and the subsequent treatment with a combination of inhibitors of DNA methylation and an anti&#8208;netrin&#8208;1 antibody could result in a powerful therapeutic strategy.</text>

      <text>Five&#8208;week&#8208;old female athymic Swissnu/nu mice were obtained from Charles River (Ecully, France) and were housed in a specific pathogen&#8208;free animal facility. MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 or MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231&#8208;Luc shRNA cells (2&#160;&#215;&#160;106) were resuspended in 200&#160;&#956;l PBS and implanted into the mammary gland fat pad. When tumors reached an approximate volume of 100&#160;mm3, 10&#160;mg/kg of net1&#8208;mAb (Netris Pharma, France) or an equal volume of PBS (Life Technologies) was injected intraperitoneally, twice a week for 3&#160;weeks. DAC was then injected subcutaneously into the left flank 3 times a week for 3&#160;weeks (dosage: 0.5&#160;mg/kg; vehicle: PBS) or replaced by PBS in the control groups. Tumor volumes were assessed twice a week with a caliper and calculated with the formula V&#160;=&#160;&#189; (length&#160;&#215;&#160;width2). Furthermore, a patient&#8208;derived xenograft, PDX&#8208;HBC&#8208;146, was generated and housed in the tumor model laboratory (LMT) of the Centre L&#233;on B&#233;rard. Briefly, following isoflurane anesthesia, mice were engrafted in the interscapular area with a&#160;&#8776;&#160;60&#160;mm3 patient&#8208;derived tumor. When tumors reached 120&#8211;150&#160;mm3, mice were injected subcutaneously with DAC (0.5&#160;mg/kg) or PBS 3 times a week for 3&#160;weeks and/or intraperitoneally with net1&#8208;mAb (10&#160;mg/kg) or with a human IgG1 control isotype antibody (Ctrl IgG1, 10&#160;mg/kg, Evitria, Switzerland) twice a week for 3&#160;weeks. Concomitantly, in order to evaluate the effects of the treatments on DNA methylation, cell death, cell proliferation, tumor angiogenesis, and protein expression, some xenografted mice were treated for only one week (as described above) before tumor extraction for further analysis. All experiments were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations required by the Animal Ethics Committee (accreditation of laboratory animal care by CECCAP, ENS Lyon&#8208;PBES).</text>

      <text>As previously described (Delloye&#8208;Bourgeois et&#160;al, 2009b), MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells were initially treated for 3&#160;days with DAC 10&#160;&#956;M or PBS (vehicle) and then for 2&#160;days with Control Iso&#8208;mAb or net1&#8208;mAb. After trypsinization, 2&#160;&#215;&#160;106 cells were suspended in 100&#160;&#956;l of PBS/Matrigel (1:1) and seeded on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of 10&#8208;day&#8208;old chicks. On day 17, lungs were harvested from the tumor&#8208;bearing embryos and genomic DNA was extracted with a NucleoSpin Tissue kit (Macherey&#8208;Nagel). Metastasis was quantified by PCR&#8208;based detection of the human Alu sequence, using primers for avian repeated element&#8208;specific sequences as controls (see Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S1). For both couples of primers, metastasis was assessed by polymerase activation at 95&#176;C for 2&#160;min followed by 40 cycles at 95&#176;C for 30&#160;s, 63&#176;C for 30&#160;s, and 72&#176;C for 30&#160;s. Genomic DNA extracted from chicken breast and lungs of healthy chick embryos was used to determine the threshold between neuroblastoma (NB) cell&#8208;invaded and non&#8208;invaded lungs. All experiments were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations required by the Animal Ethics Committee (accreditation of laboratory animal care by CECCAP, ENS Lyon&#8208;PBES).</text>

      <text>Immunohistochemistry staining was performed on an automated immunostainer (Ventana Discovery XT, Roche, Meylan, France) using the DABmap Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tissue samples were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Following antigen unmasking (citrate buffer pH 7.3, 98&#176;C for 35&#160;min), immunostainings were performed with a polyclonal rat anti&#8208;mouse netrin&#8208;1 antibody (R&amp;D), a rabbit polyclonal anti&#8208;DAPK1 (Acris), or an UNC5B antibody (Sigma), using the Novolink kit (Leica) for revelation. Apoptotic cell staining was performed using a rabbit cleaved caspase&#8208;3&#8208;specific antibody (Cell Signaling) and the In Situ Cell Death Detection kit POD (Roche). Angiogenesis was measured using a rabbit polyclonal CD31 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule&#8208;1) antibody (ANASPEC), and the rate of cell proliferation was determined using a mouse monoclonal MIB&#8208;1&#8208;specific antibody (DAKO). Image analysis was performed using a light microscope (Eclipse E400, Nikon France, Champigny, France) equipped with a tri&#8208;CDD video camera (Sony, Japan). Quantitative values were determined by morphometric analysis (Histolab, Microvision Instruments, Evry, France) of at least 40 fields per staining at a &#215;200 magnification for the xenograft tumor sections, and one field per staining of the total tissue section at &#215;40 magnification for the tissue microarray. The total surface occupied by the tumor was automatically measured, and the positively stained at each surface was expressed as a percentage of the total surface for each field analyzed.</text>

      <text>PCR products were then pyrosequenced using the Pyromark kit (Qiagen). Reverse single&#8208;stranded biotinylated templates were isolated using the PyroMark Vacuum Prep WorkStation (Qiagen). Forty microliters of PCR product was added to 38&#160;&#956;l of binding buffer (Qiagen) and 2&#160;&#956;l streptavidin sepharose high&#8208;performance beads (GE Healthcare&#174;). The mixtures were shaken for 10&#160;min at 200&#160;g (revolution per minute). After agitation, beads covered with biotinylated DNA were collected and retained on the filter probes by permanent vacuum. The filter probes were successively immerged in different baths: in ethanol 70% for 5&#160;s, in PyroMark denaturation solution for 5&#160;s, and in PyroMark wash buffer 1&#215; for 15&#160;s (Qiagen). The vacuum was then turned off, and the beads fixing DNA strands were released into a 96&#8208;well plate containing 25&#160;&#956;l of annealing buffer with 0.3&#160;&#956;M of sequencing primer in each well. The sequencing plate was kept at 80&#176;C for 2&#160;min and at room temperature for 5&#160;min. Pyrosequencing reactions were performed in a PyroMark Q96 system using PyroGold reagents (Qiagen).

      <text>In a substantial part of human cancers, netrin&#8208;1 (NTN1) is upregulated and this upregulation is inhibiting apoptosis induced by its so&#8208;called dependence receptors, DCC and UNC5H, and thus promotes tumor progression. However, in other cancers, the selective inhibition of this dependence receptor death pathway relies on the silencing of pro&#8208;apoptotic effector proteins. A large fraction of human breast tumors exhibits simultaneous DNA methylation&#8208;dependent loss of expression of NTN1 and of DAPK1, a serine threonine kinase known to transduce the netrin&#8208;1 dependence receptor pro&#8208;apoptotic pathway.</text>
