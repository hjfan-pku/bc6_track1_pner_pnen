      <text>The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor known for mediating xenobiotic toxicity, is expressed in B cells, which are known targets for environmental pollutants. However, it is unclear what the physiological functions of AhR in B cells are. We show here that expression of Ahr in B cells is up&#8208;regulated upon B&#8208;cell receptor (BCR) engagement and IL&#8208;4 treatment. Addition of a natural ligand of AhR, FICZ, induces AhR translocation to the nucleus and transcription of the AhR target gene Cyp1a1, showing that the AhR pathway is functional in B cells. AhR&#8208;deficient (Ahr &#8722;/&#8722;) B cells proliferate less than AhR&#8208;sufficient (Ahr +/+) cells following in&#160;vitro  BCR stimulation and in&#160;vivo adoptive transfer models confirmed that Ahr &#8722;/&#8722; B cells are outcompeted by Ahr +/+ cells. Transcriptome comparison of AhR&#8208;deficient and AhR&#8208;sufficient B cells identified cyclin O (Ccno), a direct target of AhR, as a top candidate affected by AhR deficiency.</text>

      <text>The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand&#8208;dependent transcription factor that responds to environmental signals, is widely expressed in the haematopoietic system. As the AhR had originally been defined as the receptor for dioxins and other chemical pollutants, the effect of those substances on the development and function of immune cells was a focus in toxicological research for many years (Kerkvliet, 2002). However, more recently the emphasis shifted towards attempts to delineate the physiological functions of AhR, which are indicated by its strong evolutionary conservation from invertebrate onwards (Hahn et&#160;al, 1997). These studies were facilitated by the availability of AhR&#8208;deficient mice (Fernandez&#8208;Salguero et&#160;al, 1995; Schmidt et&#160;al, 1996; Mimura et&#160;al, 1997). Although such mice exhibit no overt immunological phenotype in steady state, alterations in immune responses and cell types are revealed upon immunological challenge, indicating a substantial, if currently insufficiently characterized role for AhR in many cell types of the immune system, reviewed in (Stockinger et&#160;al, 2014). In B cells, AhR is widely expressed in developmental subsets and upon activation (Marcus et&#160;al, 1998; Tanaka et&#160;al, 2005; Sherr &amp; Monti, 2013), and AhR engagement by environmental toxins was shown to lead to suppression of humoral immune responses (Kerkvliet et&#160;al, 1990).</text>

      <text>However, the physiological importance of AhR expression in B cells remains ill defined. Here, we investigated the impact of AhR deficiency on B&#8208;cell function in the absence of xenobiotic influences.</text>

      <text>We generated mice with B cell&#8208;specific deletion of Ahr via the Cre&#8208;loxP system. AhR deficiency had no influence on B&#8208;cell responses to T&#8208;dependent and T&#8208;independent antigens. However, AhR&#8208;deficient B cells exhibited reduced ability to proliferate, being less prone to enter the S phase of the cell cycle. As a consequence, Ahr &#8722;/&#8722; B cells were unable to compete with Ahr +/+ B cells and were impaired in their ability to reconstitute an empty host or mount an antigen&#8208;dependent proliferative response in&#160;vivo. Global comparison of the transcriptome of AhR&#8208;deficient and AhR&#8208;sufficient B cells identified cyclin O (Ccno) as one of the top candidates affected by AhR deficiency, and ChIP analysis of the Ccno locus showed it to be directly regulated by AhR.</text>

      <text>Aryl hydrocarbon receptor expression in B cells has been previously shown (Marcus et&#160;al, 1998; Tanaka et&#160;al, 2005), but these studies did not explore the full repertoire of B&#8208;cell activation stimuli and were largely based on using total splenocytes or cell lines. In order to define the levels of Ahr expression in different developmental subsets of B cells, we FACS purified B&#8208;cell subsets from bone marrow, spleen, peritoneal cavity and Peyer's patches of non&#8208;immune C57Bl/6 mice. Ahr was expressed across most subsets, albeit at lower levels in bone marrow Pro and PreB cells and germinal centre (GC) B cells. The highest expression was found in splenic marginal zone B cells (MZB), peritoneal CD5+ B1 cells and bone marrow&#8208;resident plasma cells (PCs) (Figs&#160;1A and EV1A). The expression levels of Ahr in total spleen B220+ B cells were similar to that of TH17 cells (Fig&#160;EV1B) and among splenic subsets MZB cells expressed the highest levels of Ahr (Fig&#160;EV1C). Activation of B cells through the BCR, and to some degree with IL&#8208;4, resulted in substantial up&#8208;regulation of Ahr, whereas TLR ligands such as LPS or CpG as well as CD40 ligand and BAFF did not affect Ahr levels (Fig&#160;1B). We further explored whether BCR crosslinking and IL&#8208;4 could synergize in inducing Ahr expression. As shown in Fig&#160;1C&#8211;E, co&#8208;stimulation of B cells with anti&#8208;IgM and IL&#8208;4 substantially increased AhR mRNA and protein expression as compared to the single treatments. The increase in Ahr expression upon BCR stimulation with anti&#8208;IgM (&#945;&#8208;IgM) was seen across all subsets of splenic B cells (Fig&#160;1F). AhR expression peaked after 4&#160;h of stimulation with anti&#8208;IgM and IL&#8208;4 and steadily decreased over time approaching steady&#8208;state levels by 24&#160;h (Fig&#160;1G).</text>

      <text>Regulation of Ahr expression had previously been linked to the canonical NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway, albeit in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Vogel et&#160;al, 2014). We assessed the potential contribution of this pathway in our system using the IKK&#946; inhibitor BI605906, which blocks the degradation of I&#954;B&#945;, thereby preventing nuclear translocation of NF&#8208;&#954;B. However, inhibition of NF&#8208;&#954;B did not influence Ahr up&#8208;regulation upon BCR stimulation (Fig&#160;EV1D&#8211;F). AhR is therefore expressed in steady&#8208;state B cell and further induced upon engagement of the BCR in an NF&#8208;&#954;B&#8208;independent fashion.</text>

      <text>We next determined the translocation of AhR from its cytoplasmic localization to the nucleus following exposure to ligand. Western blot analysis of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of &#945;&#8208;IgM&#8208;activated B cells exposed to either the vehicle control DMSO, the high&#8208;affinity endogenous ligand FICZ or the AhR inhibitor CH223191 showed increased nuclear translocation upon exposure to FICZ, although there was some nuclear AhR detectable in the control samples too (Fig&#160;2A). This could be due to the presence of tryptophan in culture medium that is rapidly metabolized to form the AhR ligand FICZ (Veldhoen et&#160;al, 2009); however, we cannot exclude also a direct effect of DMSO in driving AhR translocation into the nucleus. In contrast, the presence of the AhR inhibitor reduced nuclear translocation, also compared to the DMSO control.</text>

      <text>As a consequence of nuclear translocation following AhR activation, the downstream target Cyp1a1 was induced (Fig&#160;2B). This required both activation and exposure to AhR agonist and was restricted to activation via the B&#8208;cell receptor. Although IL&#8208;4 treatment of B cells increased their expression of Ahr, IL&#8208;4 in conjunction with FICZ did not activate the AhR pathway and therefore did not result in induction of Cyp1a1. In order to investigate AhR activation in B cells on the single cell level, we took advantage of a mouse model in which AhR activation can be traced by expression of a reporter gene. This knock&#8208;in mouse strain bears a gene encoding Cre recombinase under control of the endogenous Cyp1a1 promoter (Henderson et&#160;al, 2015). Breeding these mice with reporter mice expressing eYFP from the Rosa26 promoter allowed visualizing cells that had activated the AhR pathway via eYFP expression.</text>

      <text>As shown in Fig&#160;2C, B cells from Cyp1a1 Cre reporter mice, cultured either without stimulation (medium), with IL&#8208;4 or with the combination of IL&#8208;4 and &#945;&#8208;IgM showed increased eYFP expression upon BCR stimulation, already under baseline conditions without addition of AhR agonist. Addition of FICZ markedly increased eYFP expression in &#945;&#8208;IgM&#8208;stimulated cells, whereas addition of the AhR antagonist CH223191 reduced the background levels of eYFP (which are due to AhR agonists in the medium) and also suppressed eYFP expression in stimulated B cells. Optimal induction of Cyp1a1 expression was dependent on both B&#8208;cell receptor triggering and presence of AhR ligand and was observed across all mature B&#8208;cell subsets in the spleen (Fig&#160;2D).</text>

      <text>In order to investigate whether AhR is functionally active in B cells in&#160;vivo, we crossed the Cyp1a1 Cre reporter mice to transgenic mice expressing a hen egg lysozyme (HEL)&#8208;specific BCR (SW HEL mice) (Phan et&#160;al, 2003). In SW HEL mice, 40&#8211;60% of B cells respond to HEL and these B cells are able to undergo class switching. We transferred total splenocytes from CD45.1 allotype&#8208;marked SW HEL Cyp1a1 Cre mice together with sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) coupled with HEL or mock&#8208;coupled into C57Bl/6 recipients to induce a T cell&#8208;dependent response of HEL&#8208;specific B cells. In addition, some of the mice received injection of the xenobiotic AhR ligand 3&#8208;methylcholanthrene (3&#8208;MC), since FICZ is rapidly metabolized in&#160;vivo (Fig&#160;3A). Seven days later, eYFP expression in GC and non&#8208;GC B cells isolated from the spleens of recipient mice was analysed. Upon immunization with SRBC&#8208;HEL, the transferred B cells expanded and formed GC (Fig&#160;3B middle and lower rows), whereas mice treated with SRBC&#8208;mock had no detectable donor&#8208;derived GC B cells and&#160;even in the presence of 3&#8208;MC failed to show induction of Cyp1a1 (measured as eYFP, Fig&#160;3B top row). Mice that received SRBC&#8208;HEL together with vehicle showed GC B&#8208;cell expansion, but no up&#8208;regulation of Cyp1a1. Only the combination of antigen&#8208;dependent activation and AhR agonist was able to drive Cyp1a1 expression in both GC and non&#8208;GC B cells (Fig&#160;3B bottom row, Fig&#160;3C and D).</text>

      <text>In order to evaluate the consequences of AhR deficiency in B cells, we established mice that specifically lack AhR in B cells by crossing Ahr +/+ or Ahr &#8722;/&#8722; mb1 Cre mice with Ahr fl/fl mice to generate Ahr fl/+ mb1 Cre+ controls and Ahr fl/&#8722; mb1 Cre+ offspring (Fig&#160;EV2A). mb1 Cre mice carry a construct for Cre recombinase under the control of the B cell&#8208;specific mb1 promoter (mb1 encodes for Ig&#945;/CD79A, an essential signalling component of the BCR complex; Hobeika et&#160;al, 2006). The mice we generated also express a Cre&#8208;dependent reporter that marks cells as eYFP+ upon Cre recombinase activation (Fig&#160;EV2A). Cre&#8208;induced deletion of Ahr, as well as eYFP fate&#8208;reporting, was efficient and specific, from the earliest stages of B&#8208;cell development in the bone marrow (c&#8208;kitint B220+ cells) to the peripheral compartment (Fig&#160;EV2B&#8211;E). We assessed the composition of the B&#8208;cell compartment and serum immunoglobulin levels at steady state in Ahr fl/&#8722; mb1 Cre+ and Ahr fl/+ mb1 Cre+ non&#8208;immune mice and compared them to mice with complete deletion of AhR (Ahr &#8722;/&#8722;). B cell&#8208;specific AhR&#8208;deficient mice and full Ahr &#8722;/&#8722; mice showed no major differences in the distribution of B&#8208;cell subsets (Fig&#160;EV3A and Appendix&#160;Fig S1A). However, full Ahr &#8722;/&#8722; mice had altered serum immunoglobulin levels as compared to Ahr +/+ controls, showing elevated IgM but reduced IgG1 isotypes (Appendix&#160;Fig S1B and C), whereas other isotypes were expressed to similar levels (Appendix&#160;Fig S1D&#8211;G). In contrast, there were no differences in the serum immunoglobulin levels between Ahr fl/&#8722; mb1 Cre+ and Ahr fl/+ mb1 Cre+ mice (Fig&#160;EV3B&#8211;G). Responses to immunization with T&#8208;independent (TNP&#8208;Ficoll) and T&#8208;dependent (NP&#8208;CGG and cholera toxin&#8212;Ctx) antigens resulted in similar antibody responses in mice with AhR&#8208;deficient or AhR&#8208;sufficient B cells (Fig&#160;EV4).</text>

      <text>However, it was noticeable that AhR&#8208;deficient B cells (Fig&#160;4A, black line) were compromised in their proliferative potential following BCR stimulation, compared with AhR&#8208;sufficient B cells (Fig&#160;4A, solid grey). B cells from heterozygous Ahr +/&#8722; mice showed similar reduced proliferation in the presence of the AhR antagonist CH223191 (Fig&#160;4A, red line). This reduced proliferation was reflected in a decrease in dilution of the cell division tracer CTV dye (Fig&#160;4A), reduced expansion index (Fig&#160;4B), and a reduction in the percentage of divided cells (Fig&#160;4C), while the replication index was similar (Fig&#160;4D), indicating that those Ahr &#8722;/&#8722; B cells that entered division proceeded through the cell cycle like AhR&#8208;sufficient cells. The delay in cell cycle progression was caused by increased retention in G0/G1 phase of AhR&#8208;deficient B cells (Fig&#160;4E). We further tested whether AhR deficiency causes apoptosis in B cells cultured for 72&#160;h in medium or IL&#8208;4 by staining for annexin&#8208;V, but there was no evidence that the reduced expansion of AhR&#8208;deficient B cells was linked to apoptosis (Appendix&#160;Fig S2).</text>

      <text>To test whether AhR regulates proliferation in response to antigenic stimulation, we co&#8208;transferred splenocytes from SW HEL Ahr &#8722;/&#8722; and SW HEL Ahr +/+ mice (distinguishable by CD45 allotype expression) into C57Bl/6 CD45.1+ hosts together with SRBC&#8208;HEL (Fig&#160;5C). 7&#160;days later, the distribution of HEL&#8208;specific AhR&#8208;deficient and AhR&#8208;sufficient B cells in the spleen of recipient mice was analysed. Immunization with SRBC&#8208;HEL caused expansion of both Ahr +/+ (black, CD45.1+ CD45.2+) and Ahr &#8722;/&#8722; (white, CD45.2+) B cells compared to the mock immunized controls (Fig&#160;5D). However, AhR&#8208;sufficient B cells expanded more than AhR&#8208;deficient B cells so that over 60% of the HEL&#8208;specific B cells detected in the recipient mice originated from the AhR&#8208;sufficient input, whereas AhR&#8208;deficient B cells only represented less than 40% of the HEL&#8208;specific B&#8208;cell pool (Fig&#160;5E).</text>

      <text>To test whether the reduced proliferation potential of Ahr &#8722;/&#8722; B cells has further functional consequences in&#160;vivo, we tested whether AhR deficiency had an impact on the generation of short&#8208;lived splenic and long&#8208;lived bone marrow plasma cells (PCs) in non&#8208;immune mice. Ahr fl/&#8722; mb1 Cre+ mice showed a reduced number of PCs in the spleen as compared to AhR&#8208;sufficient controls (Appendix&#160;Fig S3A and B). On the other hand, in the bone marrow long&#8208;lived PCs were represented in similar numbers in Ahr fl/&#8722; mb1 Cre+ mice compared with Ahr fl/+ mb1 Cre+ mice (Appendix&#160;Fig S3C and D). Immunization with NP&#8208;CGG, however, did not reveal any difference between splenic PC numbers of Ahr fl/&#8722; mb1 Cre+ mice compared with Ahr fl/+ mb1 Cre+ mice. This might indicate that the partial proliferative defect can eventually be corrected provided there are not wild&#8208;type competitor B cells around (Appendix&#160;Fig S3E).</text>

      <text>We next determined whether AhR deficiency in B cells influences the generation of high&#8208;affinity antibodies in&#160;vivo. For this, we co&#8208;transferred in a 1:1 ratio splenocytes from SW HEL mice, which were either AhR&#8208;deficient (white) or AhR&#8208;sufficient (black). The hosts were immunized with SRBC coupled with a modified HEL protein carrying three point mutations (HEL3x), for which the SW HEL B&#8208;cell receptor has 10,000&#8208;fold lower affinity compared with unmodified HEL (Fig&#160;EV5A). Therefore, only B cells that have undergone affinity maturation in GC are able to bind HEL3x (Paus et&#160;al, 2006). AhR deficiency did not compromise the intrinsic ability to undergo affinity maturation as suggested by the similar proportions of HEL3x&#8208;binding IgG1+ or IgG1&#8722; B cells between the two genotypes (Figs&#160;5F and EV5B). Nevertheless, when total numbers of B cells that underwent affinity maturation were taken into consideration, both IgG1+ and IgG1&#8722; HEL3x&#8208;binding B cells from AhR&#8208;deficient hosts were substantially reduced compared with their AhR&#8208;sufficient counterpart, likely due to their reduced expansion potential (Fig&#160;5G).</text>

      <text>A role for AhR in the regulation of the cell cycle has been described before, albeit in cell lines, and the suggestion was that induction of the cell cycle inhibitor p27kip1 underlies the G0/G1 cell cycle arrest following dioxin treatment, whereas other studies described cell cycle arrest in AhR&#8208;deficient cell types (Ma &amp; Whitlock, 1996; Elizondo et&#160;al, 2000; Levine&#8208;Fridman et&#160;al, 2004). We therefore tested expression of p27kip1, expression of the activation markers CD69, CD86 and MHC II, and calcium mobilization following activation of AhR&#8208;sufficient and AhR&#8208;deficient B cells with &#945;&#8208;IgM. Ahr &#8722;/&#8722; B cells did not show any alteration in p27Kip1 expression or activation markers as compared to AhR&#8208;sufficient B cells upon BCR engagement (Appendix&#160;Fig S4A&#8211;D) nor did they show altered calcium mobilization (Appendix&#160;Fig S4E). Since AhR targets a large number of genes, we performed an unbiased RNA sequencing screen, comparing Ahr +/+ and Ahr &#8722;/&#8722; B cells activated in&#160;vitro with &#945;&#8208;IgM and IL&#8208;4 in the presence of FICZ. Figure&#160;6A and B, and Appendix&#160;Tables S1 and S2 show the top 20 differentially regulated genes upon deletion of Ahr. Differentially regulated genes were screened with gene ontology and pathway analysis tools. Apart from the expected absence of the prototypical AhR target genes Cyp1a1, Cyp1b1 and Ahrr, one of the most strongly down&#8208;regulated genes in AhR&#8208;deficient B cells was Ccno, encoding cyclin O, a member of the cyclin family. To confirm the RNA sequencing result and to dissect the AhR dependency of Ccno expression dynamics in B cells, splenic CD19+ B cells were isolated from Ahr fl/&#8722; mb1 Cre+ and Ahr fl/+ mb1 Cre+ mice, stimulated with &#945;&#8208;IgM and Ccno expression was assessed over a 24&#160;h period. Ccno was maximally induced about 8&#160;h after stimulation in AhR&#8208;sufficient B cells, but not detectable in AhR&#8208;deficient B cells, confirming the RNA sequencing result (Fig&#160;6C). Furthermore, Ccno expression was enhanced by concomitant stimulation with anti&#8208;IgM and IL&#8208;4 presumably due to the increased levels of AhR under these conditions (Fig&#160;6D). This was further enhanced in the presence of AhR ligands FICZ and 3&#8208;MC (Fig&#160;6E). ChIP PCR established that AhR directly bound to the Ccno promoter to regulate its expression (Fig&#160;6D).</text>

      <text>With the appreciation of physiological roles of the AhR beyond the detoxification of environmental pollutants, immunologists are increasingly focusing on the functions of this transcription factor in different immune cell populations. We had initially described expression of AhR in T cells, where it is confined to the TH17 cell subset and required for the induction of interleukin 22 (Veldhoen et&#160;al, 2008), but it appears that AhR is more widely expressed in other immune cell types (Stockinger et&#160;al, 2014). B cells show universal expression albeit at generally low levels, with the exception of subsets like MZB cells and B1 B cells. These subsets are considered to be rapidly responsive to repetitive epitopes displayed by environmental pathogens and self&#8208;antigens and may therefore be in an elevated state of activation (Martin &amp; Kearney, 2002; Baumgarth, 2011). Since BCR activation results in up&#8208;regulation of Ahr, it is likely that the increased Ahr expression in MZB and B1 cells mirrors their activation profile rather than representing a characteristic feature. Furthermore, the ability to up&#8208;regulate Ahr expression upon BCR activation applied to all splenic B&#8208;cell subsets, confirming that Ahr up&#8208;regulation may reflect BCR engagement and is not an exclusive feature of specific B&#8208;cell subsets. The link between BCR engagement and Ahr induction is still unknown, but does not involve the canonical NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway in contrast to what was recently postulated in fibroblasts (Vogel et&#160;al, 2014).</text>

      <text>The role for AhR in B cells has been studied extensively in the&#160;context of environmental chemical&#8208;mediated toxicity and suppression of the humoral immune response by dioxin is a well&#8208;established phenomenon, and exposure of primary B cells or B&#8208;cell lines to chemical AhR ligands indicated a role in the control of B&#8208;cell response acting at multiple levels (Sulentic &amp; Kaminski, 2011; Sherr &amp; Monti, 2013). Our study of B&#8208;cell function in mice in which AhR deficiency was targeted to B cells did not indicate any alterations in B&#8208;cell responses against T&#8208;independent and T&#8208;dependent challenges.</text>

      <text>However, upon closer scrutiny it was apparent that AhR&#8208;deficient B cells had reduced proliferation potential due to their retention in G0/G1 stage of the cell cycle. This defect was partial, as those B cells that managed to overcome the block proliferated normally. Nevertheless, it was apparent that AhR&#8208;deficient B cells lost out in competition with AhR&#8208;sufficient B cells, both in settings of homeostatic proliferation (Fig&#160;5A and B) and upon antigen&#8208;driven proliferation (Fig&#160;5D and E). Interestingly, Ahr deletion did not impair the ability of B cells to proliferate per se, but instead compromised their likelihood to commence the cell cycle. Indeed, the reduced expansion potential of Ahr &#8722;/&#8722; B cells was mirrored by the reduced fraction of cells undergoing cell division. On the other hand, the replication index, indicating the proliferative capacity of cells that already underwent division, was comparable between AhR&#8208;sufficient and AhR&#8208;deficient B cells. These results suggest that AhR could be a modulator of the B&#8208;cell activation threshold, augmenting the sensitivity of B cells to BCR triggers.</text>

      <text>B&#8208;cell proliferation is important to sustain the affinity maturation process in GC that allows generation of high&#8208;affinity antibodies. Recent studies showed that the magnitude of T cell help received by GC B cells in the light zone is positively correlated with the division rate and number of point mutations accumulated in immunoglobulin genes in the dark zone (Victora et&#160;al, 2010; Gitlin et&#160;al, 2014). In the SW HEL model, AhR deficiency did not impair the intrinsic ability of B cells to undergo affinity maturation, since comparable fractions of Ahr +/+ and Ahr &#8722;/&#8722; B cells underwent affinity maturation and bound HEL3x. However, because of the expansion defect of Ahr &#8722;/&#8722; B cells as compared to Ahr +/+ controls, the total number of HEL3x&#8208;binding affinity&#8208;matured AhR&#8208;deficient B cells was lower. Thus, reduced expansion rather than an intrinsic affinity maturation defect led to a reduced ability to generate high&#8208;affinity antibodies. These data are in line with the finding that AhR deficiency impacts BCR&#8208;driven proliferation, whereas T cell&#8208;driven B&#8208;cell proliferation that occurs in GC during the affinity maturation process remains unaffected. Indeed, we observed that stimuli other than through the BCR, including CD40 ligation, did not have any effect on Ahr expression levels. Mice with AhR&#8208;deficient B cells also showed a defect in short&#8208;lived plasma cells in the spleen, whereas long&#8208;lived plasma cells in the bone marrow appeared normal, suggesting that over time the reduced expansion due to problems of entering into the cell cycle can be compensated.</text>

      <text>Thus, it appears that endogenous AhR ligands play a role in maintaining the functional response of B cells to antigen activation. In order to detect AhR activation in&#160;vivo, we employed a fate reporter mouse model in which mice with Cre recombinase inserted under control of the endogenous Cyp1a1 promoter were crossed with Rosa26 eYFP reporter mice such that cell that has activated the AhR pathway and induced Cyp1a1 would be permanently labelled with the eYFP fluorochrome (Henderson et&#160;al, 2015). Under steady&#8208;state conditions, B cells of these mice did not express the reporter and in general we found very low eYFP expression, mainly in non&#8208;haematopoietic cells (M. Villa, unpublished observation). This is most likely due to the tight regulation of AhR activation that is subject to strong feedback control and therefore might not result in sufficiently prolonged Cyp1a1 expression to turn on Cre recombinase. However, deliberate addition of AhR agonists either in&#160;vitro or together with immunization in&#160;vivo strongly induced this reporter, confirming its functionality. It therefore seems that the AhR pathway is functional in B cells in&#160;vivo, but exposure to endogenous ligands was subthreshold of detection with the reporter.</text>

      <text>Observations in the toxicology field have implicated AhR in cell cycle regulation with different effects in different cell types (Puga et&#160;al, 2002). Whereas transient AhR engagement in a hepatoma cell line promoted G0/G1 to S phase transition, sustained activation with dioxin increased p27Kip1 expression, promoting cell cycle arrest (Levine&#8208;Fridman et&#160;al, 2004). In contrast, other studies showed that AhR deficiency negatively affected cell proliferation (Ma &amp; Whitlock, 1996; Elizondo et&#160;al, 2000; Tohkin et&#160;al, 2000). It is possible that prolonged AhR activation via dioxin that is not metabolized might&#160;in some cases mimic AhR deficiency, presumably due to the fact that this exposure can lead to profound down&#8208;regulation and&#160;degradation of AhR (Pollenz et&#160;al, 1998). It is noteworthy that AhR knockdown was recently shown to reduce expression of E2F1,&#160;which is involved in regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis (Frauenstein et&#160;al, 2013). These observations are difficult to extrapolate to primary B cells and we did not observe any alteration in p27kip1 levels in AhR&#8208;deficient B cells.</text>

      <text>In order to understand the mechanistic basis for the defective proliferation of AhR&#8208;deficient B cells, we carried out an unbiased RNA sequencing screen comparing BCR&#8208;activated B cells from AhR&#8208;deficient and AhR&#8208;sufficient mice. It should be noted that our screen did not overlap with previous screens of dioxin&#8208;activated B&#8208;cell lines, clearly indicating that the chemical activation of AhR interferes with B&#8208;cell responses on a different level (De Abrew et&#160;al, 2010).</text>

      <text>A top scoring differentially expressed gene, apart from AhR pathway genes such as Cyp1a1 and Ahrr, was Ccno, encoding the cyclin family member cyclin O, which seemed a plausible candidate to explain the reduced proliferative potential of AhR&#8208;deficient B cells and furthermore appears to be directly regulated by AhR as AhR bound to the Ccno promoter.</text>

      <text>Cyclin O was erroneously identified as a component of the molecular complex involved in antibody class switch recombination and affinity maturation (Muller &amp; Caradonna, 1991). However, a later report described a possible role for cyclin O in controlling cell cycle, as it is expressed as a function of the cell cycle. Cyclin O expression peaked during the G1 phase, while undergoing complete turnover by the end of the cell cycle, an expression pattern typical of cell cycle regulators (Muller &amp; Caradonna, 1993). AhR&#8208;deficient B cells failed to express Ccno, while it was transiently up&#8208;regulated in Ahr +/+ B cells about 8&#160;h after activation. Conservation analysis between the human and mouse Ccno gene established the presence of multiple dioxin response elements (DREs) within several regions of the Ccno locus (Appendix&#160;Fig S5). Although the involvement of Ccno in regulation of B&#8208;cell proliferation is so far not experimentally proven, this molecule represents a potential candidate.</text>

      <text>Thus, AhR sensing of endogenous ligands by B cells has a subtle, but detectable influence on their physiology. As the exposure of B cells to endogenous AhR ligands was not measurable using a Cyp1a1 fate reporter, we can only infer a role for AhR signalling in B cells through the deleterious effects of AhR deficiency. It is likely that the transient nature of AhR signalling is of particular significance for its physiological functions.</text>

      <text>Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed on 107 cells that were cross&#8208;linked with 1% paraformaldehyde. Chromatin was isolated upon sequential incubation steps with the following buffers: buffer 1 (Tris&#8211;HCl pH 8 10&#160;mM, EDTA 1&#160;mM, NP40 0.5%, PMSF 1&#160;mM), buffer 2 (Tris&#8211;HCl pH 8, EDTA 1&#160;mM, NaCl 0.5&#160;M, Triton X&#8208;100 1%, deoxycholate 0.5%, sarcosyl 0.5%, PMSF 1&#160;mM) and buffer 3 (Tris&#8211;HCl pH 8 10&#160;mM, EDTA 1&#160;mM, NaCl 100&#160;mM, sarcosyl 0.1%, PMSF 1 mM). Chromatin was then sheared by sonication. 10% of sonicated cell extract was kept as input. Chromatin was added with RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated overnight at 4&#176;C with 2&#160;&#956;g of anti&#8208;AhR antibody (Enzo Life Sciences, BML&#8208;SA210). Protein G Dynabeads (Life Technologies) were then added to the cell extract for 3&#160;h at 4&#176;C. Samples were washed 7&#215; in RIPA wash buffer (added with SDS 0.1%). Crosslinking was reversed in TE buffer pH 8, SDS 0.5%, proteinase K 200&#160;&#956;g/ml and incubated overnight at 65&#176;C. DNA was isolated with phenol/chloroform and&#160;analysed by quantitative PCR and by normalization relative to&#160;input DNA amount.
