      <text>Mitochondrial dysfunction and accumulation of damaged mitochondria are considered major contributors to aging. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for these mitochondrial alterations remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) plays a key role in the control of muscle mitochondrial damage. We show that aging is characterized by a progressive reduction in Mfn2 in mouse skeletal muscle and that skeletal muscle Mfn2 ablation in mice generates a gene signature linked to aging. Furthermore, analysis of muscle Mfn2&#8208;deficient mice revealed that aging&#8208;induced Mfn2 decrease underlies the age&#8208;related alterations in metabolic homeostasis and sarcopenia. Mfn2 deficiency reduced autophagy and impaired mitochondrial quality, which contributed to an exacerbated age&#8208;related mitochondrial dysfunction. Interestingly, aging&#8208;induced Mfn2 deficiency triggers a ROS&#8208;dependent adaptive signaling pathway through induction of HIF1&#945; transcription factor and BNIP3. This pathway compensates for the loss of mitochondrial autophagy and minimizes mitochondrial damage. Our findings reveal that Mfn2 repression in muscle during aging is a determinant for the inhibition of mitophagy and accumulation of damaged mitochondria and triggers the induction of a mitochondrial quality control pathway.</text>

      <text>Aging is a process characterized by a progressive accumulation of damage that leads to tissue dysfunction and failure. Skeletal muscle is one of the tissues most affected by aging. During aging, there is a gradual loss of muscle mass and function (sarcopenia), which are associated with frailty and a reduction in quality of life in the elderly (Cesari et&#160;al, 2014). In addition, skeletal muscle alterations play a central role in aging&#8208;associated metabolic dysregulation (Dela &amp; Kjaer, 2006). Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms causing aging&#8208;induced skeletal muscle alterations is of great importance for healthy aging (de Cabo et&#160;al, 2014).</text>

      <text>A hallmark of aging is the presence of a decline in mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle associated with accumulation of mitochondrial damage, abundant morphological alterations in mitochondria (e.g., rounded and giant mitochondria), reduced mitochondrial respiration, and increased oxidative stress (Shigenaga et&#160;al, 1994; Preston et&#160;al, 2008; Artal&#8208;Sanz &amp; Tavernarakis, 2009; Bratic &amp; Larsson, 2013). Recent data indicate that aging is characterized by impaired mitophagy in C.&#160;elegans, which may explain the accumulation of damaged mitochondria (Palikaras et&#160;al, 2015). However, there is still debate about whether mitochondrial deficiency could be driving some of the age&#8208;related alterations or on the contrary, age&#8208;associated mitochondrial dysfunction might be secondary to aging itself (Bratic &amp; Larsson, 2013).</text>

      <text>Mitochondrial dynamics is a crucial process not only for mitochondrial morphology but also in the control of mitochondrial function, response to apoptotic stimuli, and mitochondrial quality control (Twig et&#160;al, 2008; Liesa et&#160;al, 2009). Mitochondrial dynamics is controlled by fusion and fission proteins. Mitofusin 1 and 2 (Mfn1/2) proteins are involved in the outer mitochondrial membrane fusion, whereas optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) protein is involved in fusion of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Fission of mitochondria is controlled by Fis1, Drp1, and Mff proteins. A correct balance between fusion and fission is essential for mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis (Liesa &amp; Shirihai, 2013).</text>

      <text>Besides its role in mitochondrial fusion, Mfn2 has been described to be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, oxidative metabolism, autophagy, mitophagy, mitochondrial antiviral signaling, and unfolded protein response (Bach et&#160;al, 2003; Chen et&#160;al, 2004; Yasukawa et&#160;al, 2009; Hailey et&#160;al, 2010; Ngoh et&#160;al, 2012; Zhao et&#160;al, 2012; Chen &amp; Dorn, 2013; Munoz et&#160;al, 2013). Recently, we have elucidated the role of Mfn2 in skeletal muscle in&#160;vivo. Deficiency of Mfn2 in skeletal muscle leads to reduced mitochondrial respiration and increased oxidative stress leading to inhibition of insulin signaling. As a result, high&#8208;fat&#8208;fed Mfn2&#8208;deficient mice show glucose intolerance and greater insulin resistance, which highlights the importance of Mfn2 in the maintenance of normal muscle metabolism (Sebastian et&#160;al, 2012).</text>

      <text>Here, we analyzed the role of Mfn2 during aging. We show that Mfn2 protein expression decreases during aging in skeletal muscle&#160;and deficiency of Mfn2 in young mice aggravates the age&#8208;associated whole&#8208;body metabolic alterations and sarcopenia, mainly as a result of impaired autophagy and mitochondrial quality. Furthermore, aging and reduction in Mfn2 trigger an adaptive signaling pathway involving HIF1&#945; in order to minimize the accumulation of damaged mitochondria. Overall, the data presented here describe a new role for Mfn2 connecting mitochondrial function and quality to the maintenance of metabolism and muscle fitness during aging.</text>

      <text>It has not been evaluated in mammals whether mitochondrial dynamics has an impact on aging. Based on the functional relevance of mitochondrial fusion and fission factors, we decided to analyze whether the mitochondrial fusion protein mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) plays a role in aging. We show that Mfn2 protein expression is markedly reduced in skeletal muscles in old mice (Figs&#160;1A and EV1A), to a lesser extent in heart and no changes were detectable in liver (Fig&#160;EV1B). Mfn2 downregulation occurred in the absence of changes in the expression of other mitochondrial proteins such as Porin or ATP5a (Fig&#160;1A). Moreover, analysis of Mfn2 expression in young adult (6&#8208;month&#8208;old), middle aged (12&#8208;month&#8208;old), and old (22&#8208;month&#8208;old) mice revealed that the decrease of Mfn2 protein expression was progressive during aging (Fig&#160;EV1C). Reduction in Mfn2 was not a consequence of reduced gene expression (Fig&#160;EV1D) or lower availability of Mfn2 mRNA for translation, as indicated by the lack of changes of Mfn2 mRNA levels in polysomal fractions, containing actively translated mRNAs bound to ribosomes (Fig&#160;EV1E). These results suggest that reduced Mfn2 expression in aged muscle may be a consequence of changes in protein turnover. In addition to Mfn2, the expression of other mitochondrial dynamics proteins, such as Mfn1, OPA1, and Fis1 but not Drp1, was reduced during aging in skeletal muscle (Fig&#160;EV1F).</text>

      <text>To gain insight into the consequences of Mfn2 repression in muscle during aging, and the identification of the mechanisms involved, we used Mef2C&#8208;Cre+/&#8722;Mfn2LoxP/LoxP mice (Mfn2KO mice) as reported previously (Sebastian et&#160;al, 2012). Mfn2KO mice showed an 80% reduction in Mfn2 expression in muscle and heart, and a 50% reduction in other tissues such as WAT, kidney, or liver (Sebastian et&#160;al, 2012). We performed transcriptomic analysis in muscle from 6&#8208;month&#8208;old control and Mfn2KO mice and 22&#8208;month&#8208;old control and Mfn2KO mice. Deficiency of Mfn2 in skeletal muscle caused a deregulation of 186 genes in young mice and of 53 genes in old mice (Fig&#160;1B). Aging caused a change in expression of 2,550 genes in control mice (Fig&#160;1C). Interestingly, 62% of genes deregulated in Mfn2KO young mice were also altered during aging in control mice (Fig&#160;1B and C, Table&#160;EV1). Moreover, these genes were further deregulated in Mfn2KO old mice compared with control old mice (Fig&#160;1C). GSEA analysis of transcriptomic data further revealed that genes deregulated by Mfn2 deficiency were significantly enriched during normal aging in control mice (Fig&#160;1D). These alterations occurred in the absence of changes in the expression of other mitochondrial dynamics proteins in Mfn2KO mice (Fig&#160;EV1F). Analysis of life span revealed no changes in Mfn2KO mice compared to control mice (Fig&#160;EV1G). Therefore, all these results indicate that Mfn2 decreases with aging in mouse skeletal muscle, which participates in the generation of an aging gene signature.</text>

      <text>Mfn2 controls mitochondrial respiration (Bach et&#160;al, 2003; Sebastian et&#160;al, 2012; Segales et&#160;al, 2013). Therefore, we analyzed mitochondrial oxygen consumption in isolated muscle fibers from young and old control and Mfn2KO mice. Mitochondrial respiration was reduced during aging in control mice and further decreased in old Mfn2KO mice (Fig&#160;2A). These alterations were restricted to skeletal muscle, and other tissues such as liver, heart, and WAT did not show any changes in mitochondrial respiration in Mfn2KO mice (Appendix&#160;Figs S1A and S2B and C). Alterations in muscle oxygen consumption were independent of major changes in protein expression of subunits of respiratory electron transport chain (Appendix&#160;Fig&#160;S1D), mitochondrial mass (Fig&#160;2B), and ATP content in skeletal muscle (Appendix&#160;Fig&#160;S1E). Glucose oxidation in soleus muscles was also decreased during aging or in Mfn2KO mice (Appendix&#160;Fig&#160;S1F). NADH&#8208;TR and SDH staining were decreased in young Mfn2KO mice and during aging in control mice, and further reduced in old Mfn2KO mice, confirming a decreased oxidative capacity during aging and Mfn2&#8208;deficiency conditions (Fig&#160;2C and D). Mfn2 deficiency was also characterized by higher levels of hydrogen peroxide and enhanced protein carbonylation indicating an enhanced oxidative stress (Fig&#160;2E and F). Activity of antioxidant enzymes was modified by aging, but no changes were detected between genotypes, except for glutathione peroxidase, which is increased in young Mfn2KO mice (Appendix&#160;Fig&#160;S1G&#8211;J). Mfn2 reduction was not associated with an increase in mtDNA mutations as evidenced by the lack of changes in the number of COX negative/SDH&#8208;positive fibers (Appendix&#160;Fig&#160;S1K). Ultrastructural morphometric analysis of muscle sections revealed the presence of abnormalities in mitochondria from aged mice such as increased mitochondrial area and decreased mitochondrial density (Fig&#160;2G and Appendix&#160;Fig S1L). These alterations were more extreme in Mfn2KO old mice (Fig&#160;2G and Appendix&#160;Fig&#160;S1L). Moreover, Mfn2KO old mice showed a greater abundance of aberrant mitochondria, swollen mitochondria, or organelles with disrupted cristae (Fig&#160;2H). In all, our data indicate that Mfn2 deficiency in skeletal muscle causes the development of age&#8208;related alterations in mitochondrial function and are coherent with the view that Mfn2 repression that occurs with aging plays a role in the development of mitochondrial dysfunction in this condition.</text>

      <text>Skeletal muscle plays an important role in the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis in&#160;vivo (Rolfe &amp; Brown, 1997). On the basis of the impact of Mfn2 deficiency on mitochondrial function and oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle, we tested whether these alterations could have a role in the metabolic alterations that are common to aging, such as glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and lower energy expenditure (Niccoli &amp; Partridge, 2012). Body weight was increased in Mfn2KO old mice compared to controls (Fig&#160;3A) as a result of an increase in adiposity (Fig&#160;3B), with no changes in the weight of liver, heart, or brain (Appendix&#160;Fig S2A) and without changes in food intake (Appendix&#160;Fig&#160;S2B). Moreover, by using indirect calorimetry, we showed that during aging there is a decrease in whole&#8208;body oxygen consumption in control mice which is further decreased in Mfn2KO old animals (Fig&#160;3C and D). Activity was also reduced in Mfn2KO old mice in the night&#8208;active period (Fig&#160;3E). Glucose oxidation fluxes also decreased during aging in both diurnal and nocturnal phases, and a greater reduction was detected in Mfn2KO mice (Fig&#160;3F). Lipid oxidation in the diurnal phase were equally reduced by aging in both genotypes (Fig&#160;3G). However, lipid oxidation was higher in Mfn2KO animals during the night irrespective of age, indicating a lower suppression of lipid oxidation during the night&#8208;feeding period (Fig&#160;3G). This pattern is consistent with the presence of metabolic inflexibility in Mfn2KO mice.</text>

      <text>Previously, we reported that 12&#8208;month&#8208;old Mfn2KO mice showed enhanced susceptibility to develop insulin resistance compared to control animals (Sebastian et&#160;al, 2012). However, no changes in glucose tolerance or insulin tolerance were detected at that age&#160;(Sebastian et&#160;al, 2012). Here, we extended the study to 22&#8208;month&#8208;old mice and we found that at this age, Mfn2KO mice were glucose intolerant (Fig&#160;3H), showed greater insulin levels during the glucose tolerance test (Fig&#160;3I) and were profoundly insulin resistant (Fig&#160;3J). Metabolic analysis of 6&#8208;, 12&#8208;, and 22&#8208;month&#8208;old mice showed that the impaired metabolic homeostasis (basal insulinemia, insulin levels during the glucose tolerance test, and insulin tolerance test) was gradual during aging, but in Mfn2KO, this process was accelerated (alterations normally seen at 22&#160;months in control mice were already detectable in 12&#8208;month&#8208;old Mfn2KO mice) (Appendix&#160;Fig S2C&#8211;E). Basal levels of Akt phosphorylation were reduced in old mice, indicating a lower basal insulin signaling, and AMPK phosphorylation was increased only in old Mfn2KO mice, probably as a result of alterations in the energy status (Appendix&#160;Fig S2F). Overall, our results documented that Mfn2 downregulation during aging plays a relevant role in the triggering of age&#8208;related metabolic alterations.</text>

      <text>During aging, there is a gradual loss of muscle mass and function (sarcopenia) (Cesari et&#160;al, 2014). It has been postulated that mitochondrial dysfunction is a contributing factor, although the mechanisms involved have not yet been elucidated (Marzetti et&#160;al, 2013). Based on the effects of Mfn2 deficiency on other age&#8208;related abnormalities, we analyzed whether Mfn2 could have a role in this process. Muscles from young Mfn2KO showed a moderate reduction in mass (Fig&#160;4A) and a greater reduction in muscle fiber size as assessed by cross&#8208;sectional area (CSA) (Fig&#160;4B and C). During aging, there is a reduction in muscle mass in both genotypes, but CSA was lower in old Mfn2KO mice compared to age&#8208;matched controls (Fig&#160;4A&#8211;C). Analysis of fiber size distribution confirmed these results, showing that aging or Mfn2 deficiency led to an increased number of small fibers and a reduced number of larger fibers (Fig&#160;4C). Further analyses revealed that muscle atrophy in Mfn2&#8208;deficient mice and during normal aging was due to the specific atrophy of type IIb glycolytic fibers (Fig&#160;4F). Type IIb represents the majority of fibers in gastrocnemius, and although oxidative fibers are usually smaller than glycolytic fibers (Hamalainen &amp; Pette, 1993), only minor changes in the proportion of fiber types were detected by Mfn2 deficiency in young mice, corresponding to slight increases of type I and IIx fibers (Fig&#160;4D and E).</text>

      <text>The increased muscle atrophy in Mfn2KO mice together with the reduced ambulation detected in indirect calorimetry studies (Fig&#160;3E) suggests an impaired muscle function in Mfn2KO old mice. To investigate muscle performance, we performed treadmill and grip strength test in control and Mfn2KO mice. Old Mfn2KO mice showed lower physical capacity, as revealed by a decrease in the total time and distance ran on the treadmill (Fig&#160;4G), which correlated with reduced grip strength (Fig&#160;4H). We next assessed muscle mechanical properties on isolated muscles ex&#160;vivo. Muscles from old Mfn2KO mice showed a decreased capacity to increase their force after tetanic stimulation compared to the old control group (Fig&#160;4I). Detailed graphical analyses of muscle contraction parameters showed an increase in the twitch to tetanus ratio, half relaxation time and in contraction time in muscles from old Mfn2KO mice (Fig&#160;4J&#8211;L). Of note, these parameters have been reported to be altered with aging in both rodents and humans (Campbell et&#160;al, 1973; Fitts et&#160;al, 1984; Brooks &amp; Faulkner, 1988). Taken together, our results indicate that Mfn2 deficiency promotes sarcopenia and impairs muscle function during aging.</text>

      <text>To further confirm that the muscle alterations were a consequence of a primary deficiency of Mfn2 in skeletal muscle, we generated a new mouse model with a specific ablation of Mfn2 in skeletal muscle (MLC1&#8208;Mfn2KO mice or SkM&#8208;KO mice). SkM&#8208;KO mice showed a drastic reduction in Mfn2 expression in different muscles whereas no alterations were detected in other tissues (Appendix&#160;Fig S3A). As it has been shown for young Mfn2KO mice (Sebastian et&#160;al, 2012), young SkM&#8208;KO mice displayed no alterations in glucose homeostasis (Appendix&#160;Fig S3B and C). However, muscle&#8208;specific ablation of Mfn2 caused a reduced whole&#8208;body oxygen consumption (Appendix&#160;Fig S3D). Importantly, young SkM&#8208;KO mice also developed muscle atrophy as shown in Mfn2KO mice (Appendix&#160;Fig S3E). In all, SkM&#8208;KO mice recapitulate the main phenotypic features shown in Mfn2KO mice.</text>

      <text>In order to study the mechanisms by which Mfn2 deficiency develops muscle atrophy and sarcopenia, we evaluated the involvement of relevant pathways. An increased proteasomal protein degradation does not seem to be the cause of muscle atrophy in Mfn2KO mice, as evidenced by the lack of differences between genotypes on the expression of the atrogenes FbxO32 (atrogin&#8208;1), Murf1, SMART, FbxO31, and MUSA1, in the levels of K48&#8208;linked ubiquitinated proteins or in proteasome activity (Fig&#160;EV2A&#8211;E). Analysis of the mTOR signaling pathway revealed a reduction in phosphorylation of S6 during aging and in Mfn2KO mice with no changes in phosphorylation of 4EBP (Fig&#160;EV2F). Consistent with lower S6 phosphorylation, in&#160;vivo protein synthesis using SUnSET method was clearly reduced in skeletal muscle from Mfn2KO (Fig&#160;EV2G).</text>

      <text>Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is a key process in the maintenance of tissue quality by removing damaged structures or organelles and protein aggregates. Moreover, an inhibition of autophagy has been shown to be associated with muscle atrophy (Masiero &amp; Sandri, 2010; Carnio et&#160;al, 2014) and aging (Kroemer, 2015). Mfn2 depletion in cells in culture and heart has been shown to block autophagy (Zhao et&#160;al, 2012; Munoz et&#160;al, 2013; Ding et&#160;al, 2015). Therefore, we analyzed autophagy in control and Mfn2KO mice and we found that aging leads to an increase in mRNA expression of several autophagy markers, such as LC3b, Bnip3, Bnip3L but not p62, with no changes between genotypes (Fig&#160;EV3A). However, protein expression of LC3II, p62, and BNIP3 was increased during aging and in Mfn2KO mice (Fig&#160;5A&#8211;C), suggesting that autophagy was reduced in aged animals but also in Mfn2KO young mice compared to controls. To further confirm the inhibition of autophagy in Mfn2KO mice, we performed autophagy flux analysis by treating mice for 5&#160;days with chloroquine. Indeed, autophagy flux was inhibited in skeletal muscle from Mfn2KO mice (Fig&#160;5D). In order to show that this effect was cell autonomous, we also performed autophagy flux analysis in control and Mfn2KD C2C12 muscle cells. Although no changes were detected for LC3II, autophagy flux was inhibited for p62, NBR1, and BNIP3, indicating a more compromised flux of selective autophagy upon Mfn2 deficiency in muscle cells (Fig&#160;EV3B).</text>

      <text>By using transmission electron microscopy, we detected the accumulation of autophagosomes in Mfn2KO young mice and control aged animals compared to control young mice, which was again consistent with reduced autophagy (Fig&#160;5E). In Mfn2KO old animals, there was a much greater accumulation of autophagosomes and mitophagosomes (Fig&#160;5E), probably due to the reduced autophagy since early life. Similar alterations were also observed in Mfn2KD C2C12 myotubes by electron microscopy (Fig&#160;5F). The accumulation of mitochondria inside autophagosomes and the increased expression of BNIP3 suggest that mitochondrial autophagy could be also affected by Mfn2 deficiency. Moreover, Mfn2 has been shown to participate in mitophagy in cardiomyocytes (Chen &amp; Dorn, 2013; Song et&#160;al, 2015). To evaluate this possibility, we obtained mitochondrial fractions from control and Mfn2KD C2C12 myotubes and measured the presence of proteins involved in mitochondrial autophagy. Mfn2KD cells showed increased levels of BNIP3, LC3II, and Parkin in mitochondria (Fig&#160;5G). These data, together with the accumulation of mitophagosomes, suggest that autophagic degradation of mitochondria is impaired in Mfn2KD cells. Treatment of control cells with mitophagy inducer CCCP produced a time&#8208;dependent increase in the recruitment of BNIP3, LC3II, and Parkin into mitochondria (Fig&#160;5G). However, in Mfn2KD cells, this recruitment was blocked or decreased. Mitophagic flux was also inhibited in&#160;vivo in skeletal muscle, as suggested by the lower accumulation of LC3II, p62 and BNIP3 in mitochondrial fractions after treatment with chloroquine (Fig&#160;EV3C). Furthermore, despite increased accumulation of mitophagic proteins in mitochondria, mitochondrial mass in Mfn2KD cells (Fig&#160;EV3D) and skeletal muscle (Fig&#160;2B) was not decreased.</text>

      <text>In all, these data indicate that deficiency of Mfn2 impairs autophagic degradation of mitochondria leading to muscle atrophy. To confirm that inhibition of autophagy is the driver of the muscle atrophy observed in conditions of Mfn2 deficiency, we blocked autophagy in mouse in&#160;vivo by injecting chloroquine for 5&#160;days. Administration of chloroquine in mice reduced CSA of gastrocnemius muscle, indicating muscle atrophy (Fig&#160;EV3E). However, treatment of Mfn2KO mice with chloroquine did not further reduce CSA compared to control mice (Fig&#160;EV3E). In order to stablish a specific role of Mfn2 in reduction in autophagy and muscle atrophy, we performed rescue studies by adenovirus&#8208;mediated overexpression of Mfn2 in gastrocnemius muscle from Mfn2KO mice. Re&#8208;expression of Mfn2 for 2&#160;weeks led to the restoration of Mfn2 protein levels in skeletal muscle from Mfn2KO mice (Fig&#160;EV3F), caused a decrease in the accumulation of autophagy markers and increased CSA values (Fig&#160;EV3G and H). These results indicate that reduction in Mfn2 is the underlying mechanism leading to inhibition of autophagy and muscle atrophy.</text>

      <text>Further GSEA analysis of transcriptomics data from Mfn2KO mice was performed using the curated list of genesets included in the Broad Institute Molecular Signature Database (MsigDB&#8208;C2) to find molecular pathways coordinately altered in both Mfn2 deficiency and in normal aging. The use of this approach revealed an enrichment of genesets related with &#8220;response to hypoxia&#8221; (Fig&#160;6A). In keeping with this, we found that HIF1&#945;, the main regulator of hypoxia response, was upregulated during normal aging and in Mfn2KO mice (Fig&#160;6B). Moreover, we measured the expression of HIF1&#945; target genes, such as Pdk1, Pdk4, and Vegfa, and all of them were upregulated in skeletal muscle of old control and young Mfn2KO mice (Fig&#160;EV4A), confirming that HIF1&#945; activity is increased. Similar results were obtained after Mfn2 knockdown in C2C12 myotubes (Figs&#160;6C and EV4B). HIF1&#945; has been described to be involved in the activation of mitochondrial autophagy by upregulating BNIP3 (Zhang et&#160;al, 2008; Bellot et&#160;al, 2009). In order to understand the precise role of HIF1&#945; upon Mfn2 deficiency, we evaluated the impact of its increase on BNIP3 expression. To this end, control and Mfn2KD C2C12 myotubes were incubated with the specific HIF1&#945; inhibitor NSC&#8208;134754 (Chau et&#160;al, 2005). As shown in Fig&#160;6C, the increase in HIF1&#945; seen in Mfn2KD myotubes was markedly reduced upon treatment with NSC&#8208;134754, which also led to the reduction in BNIP3. We next evaluated whether inhibition of HIF1&#945; and reduction in BNIP3 could affect mitochondrial quality. Analysis of oxidative stress revealed that treatment with HIF1&#945; inhibitor increased the levels of hydrogen peroxide, in both control and Mfn2KD cells (Fig&#160;6D). Moreover, coupled mitochondrial respiration and leak were markedly impaired after treatment with NSC&#8208;134754 in Mfn2KD cells (Fig&#160;6E and F). Moreover, mitochondria from Mfn2&#8208;deficient cells showed an enhanced abundance of BNIP3, LC3 II, and Parkin, consistent with an adaptive process aimed to mitigate mitochondrial autophagy disruption (Fig&#160;6G). After treatment with HIF1&#945; inhibitor, Mfn2&#8208;deficient cells no longer showed an increase in mitochondrial BNIP3 whereas LC3II and Parkin accumulated in mitochondria from control and Mfn2KD myotubes. Our data are coherent with the existence of a further inhibition of mitochondrial autophagy upon HIF1&#945; inhibition. In keeping with this, electron microscopy analysis of control and Mfn2KD cells treated with NSC&#8208;134754 showed an increase in the presence of autophagosomes and altered mitochondria, which was much more evident in Mfn2KD cells (Fig&#160;6H and I). These data suggest that Mfn2&#8208;induced HIF1&#945; activation constitutes an adaptive mechanism in order to increase BNIP3 expression and removal of damaged mitochondria.</text>

      <text>In order to assess whether the decrease in autophagy is a driver of Mfn2 deficiency effects, we used autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A. Treatment of C2C12 myotubes with bafilomycin A caused a substantial accumulation of BNIP3, LC3II, and Parkin in mitochondrial fractions, as an expected consequence of mitochondrial autophagy inhibition (Fig&#160;EV4D). In addition, mitochondrial respiration was profoundly impaired and ROS levels were highly increased, suggesting the accumulation of damaged mitochondria (Fig&#160;EV4E&#8211;G). Under these conditions, the HIF1&#945;&#8208;BNIP3 pathway was also induced (Fig&#160;EV4H). Altogether, our results indicate that aging and Mfn2 deficiency and the concomitant reduced mitochondrial autophagy, trigger a mitochondrial retrograde signaling through HIF1&#945; in order to increase the BNIP3&#8208;dependent degradation of mitochondria and minimize the accumulation of damaged mitochondria.</text>

      <text>Next, we analyzed the mechanisms by which aging and Mfn2 deficiency lead to activation of HIF1&#945;. We focused our attention on oxidative stress since ROS has been shown to activate HIF1&#945; in several cell models (Patten et&#160;al, 2010) and we have shown an enhanced oxidative stress in old control and Mfn2KO mice (Fig&#160;2E). To assess whether ROS has a role in the activation of HIF1&#945;, we treated Mfn2KO and control mice with the antioxidant compound N&#8208;acetylcysteine (NAC) for three weeks. NAC treatment of Mfn2KO mice reduced H2O2 levels in skeletal muscle (Fig&#160;EV5A) and blocked the activation of HIF1&#945; and the increase in BNIP3 (Fig&#160;7A), demonstrating that the increase in the HIF1&#945;&#8208;BNIP3 pathway is ROS&#8208;dependent.&#160;NAC treatment also blocked the increase in ROS and the&#160;HIF1&#945;&#8208;BNIP3 pathway in C2C12 Mfn2KD myotubes (Fig&#160;EV5B and C). These results suggest a beneficial role of ROS as signaling molecules under Mfn2 deficiency conditions. If this was the case, blocking the increase in ROS should exacerbate mitochondrial alterations. In keeping with this, NAC treatment of control and Mfn2 KD C2C12 myotubes increased mitochondrial dysfunction, as demonstrated by a reduced coupled respiration in Mfn2 KD cells (Fig&#160;7B), despite increasing the presence of LC3II and Parkin in mitochondrial fractions in both mice and cells, which is consistent with a further inhibition of mitochondrial autophagy (Fig&#160;7C and D). Autophagic flux was also inhibited by NAC both in control and Mfn2KD cells, suggesting that some ROS is necessary for the maintenance of basal autophagy (Fig&#160;EV5D). Accordingly, electron microscopy analysis revealed an increase in autophagosome/mitophagosome accumulation and mitochondrial alterations upon treatment with NAC, which were much more evident in Mfn2 KD cells (Fig&#160;7E). NAC treatment led to a reduction in muscle CSA in control mice (Fig&#160;EV5E), in keeping with reduced autophagy. The reduction in muscle fiber size was greater in Mfn2KO mice, highlighting the importance of the ROS&#8208;dependent adaptive increase in BNIP3&#8208;driven mitochondrial autophagy under Mfn2&#8208;deficient conditions (Fig&#160;EV5E). Overall, these results indicate that aging and Mfn2 deficiency induce a retrograde signaling pathway through a ROS&#8208;dependent activation of HIF1&#945; in order to mitigate the defective mitochondrial autophagy.</text>

      <text>In the present study, we have demonstrated the involvement of the mitochondrial fusion protein mitofusin 2 in the aging process. Mfn2 repression in muscle during aging is a determinant for the inhibition of autophagy and accumulation of damaged mitochondria, and contributes to age&#8208;associated metabolic alterations and sarcopenia. In addition, Mfn2 deficiency triggers an adaptive pathway in order to mitigate mitochondrial damage. These conclusions are based on a number of outstanding observations, namely: (i) normal aging is characterized by a progressive reduction in Mfn2 expression in skeletal muscle; (ii) skeletal muscle Mfn2 deficiency in mice generates a genetic signature common to normal aging, indicating that both conditions show common regulators; (iii) muscle Mfn2 deficiency is characterized by further impairment in age&#8208;related alterations; (iv) muscle Mfn2 ablation caused impaired mitochondrial quality control, leading to the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria; and (v) accumulation of damaged mitochondria induced by Mfn2 deficiency triggered a ROS&#8208;dependent increase in HIF1&#945; and BNIP3 which promoted mitochondrial autophagy. These alterations caused by Mfn2 ablation occurred without affecting life span. Overall, our results allow us to propose that Mfn2 is a key protein that maintains mitochondrial quality and function, and therefore, its repression causes accelerated aging. Although a possible role of mitochondrial dynamics proteins in aging and longevity has been suggested in model organisms such as yeast (Scheckhuber et&#160;al, 2007; Bernhardt et&#160;al, 2015) and C.&#160;elegans (Yang et&#160;al, 2011), to our knowledge, this is the first report establishing a direct connection between a protein involved in mitochondrial dynamics and aging in mammals. In addition, our data are consistent with data indicating that aging is linked to defective mitophagy in C.&#160;elegans (Artal&#8208;Sanz &amp; Tavernarakis, 2009; Palikaras et&#160;al, 2015).</text>

      <text>We report that aging is characterized by a marked repression of Mfn2 protein in mouse muscle, probably as a consequence of either a lower rate of Mfn2 mRNA translation or a reduced protein stability. This occurs under conditions in which other mitochondrial dynamics proteins are also decreased but other mitochondrial proteins such as porin or OXPHOS subunits are not altered, indicating a specific dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics during aging. Reduction in Mfn2 found in our study is consistent with other reports in humans or rats in which Mfn2 was found to be downregulated during aging in skeletal muscle (Crane et&#160;al, 2010; Zhao et&#160;al, 2014). It has also been reported that Mfn2 expression is not altered in the white portion of gastrocnemius muscles in aged mice (Leduc&#8208;Gaudet et&#160;al, 2015). In this context, the expression of Mfn2 is greater in oxidative than glycolytic muscles (F.X. Soriano and A. Zorzano, unpublished observations). Based on all these data, we claim that most likely Mfn2 is mostly repressed in highly oxidative muscle fibers during aging, as shown by a higher repression in soleus than in tibialis anterior muscle (Fig&#160;EV1A). In keeping with a reduced Mfn2 expression in aged muscle, by means of transcriptomics analysis, we have identified a muscle gene signature that is common in normal aging as well as in Mfn2 deficiency. Thus, Mfn2&#8208;deficient muscle showed a pattern of deregulated genes also noted in muscles from aged mice. These data support the view that Mfn2 repression during aging potently influences muscle biology.</text>

      <text>Skeletal muscle tissue is highly affected during aging, and this has relevant consequences on muscle mass (sarcopenia), capacity to perform work, and on energy homeostasis (Dela &amp; Kjaer, 2006; Cesari et&#160;al, 2014). The mechanisms leading to age&#8208;induced muscle alterations are not known, and mitochondrial dysfunction has been suggested to be a possible cause (Lanza &amp; Nair, 2010; Marzetti et&#160;al, 2013). Here, we show that normal aging in mice is characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, reduction in mitochondrial density, and accumulation of altered mitochondria, as evidenced in previous reports (Shigenaga et&#160;al, 1994; Ojaimi et&#160;al, 1999; Short et&#160;al, 2005). Aging also caused glucose intolerance, reduced energy expenditure, and reduced muscle fiber size. Importantly, muscle Mfn2 ablation aggravated all these age&#8208;related disorders. Based on these observations, we suggest that age&#8208;induced decay in Mfn2 in skeletal muscle could be a contributing factor for the mitochondrial and metabolic alterations linked to aging. In addition, we suggest that an exaggerated Mfn2 repression in muscle with aging may be linked to unhealthy aging, and it may favor the development of the frailty syndrome.</text>

      <text>Autophagy is reduced during aging (Salminen &amp; Kaarniranta, 2009; Carnio et&#160;al, 2014), and its involvement in the accumulation of tissue damage occurring with age has been suggested (Kroemer, 2015). Autophagy is also essential for the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass and function as well as whole&#8208;body energy homeostasis (Masiero et&#160;al, 2009; Masiero &amp; Sandri, 2010). In keeping with this, we showed that aging in control mice is associated with a decrease in autophagy and with an increased abundance of abnormal mitochondria. Mfn2 deficiency also reduced autophagy in skeletal muscle and muscle cells in culture, demonstrating a cell autonomous effect of Mfn2 repression. Analysis of autophagy flux in muscle cells suggests that selective autophagy (which requires the adaptor proteins p62, BNIP3, and NBR1) is more affected by Mfn2 deficiency than general non&#8208;selective autophagy. Furthermore, Mfn2 repression also inhibited autophagic degradation of mitochondria in skeletal muscle and muscle cells in culture, leading to an extended presence of abnormal mitochondria, which correlated with an enhanced oxidative stress. These data indicate a role for Mfn2 downregulation as the cause underlying the decrease of mitochondrial autophagy occurring with age in skeletal muscle. These results are consistent with previous studies demonstrating a role of Mfn2 in autophagy and mitophagy (Hailey et&#160;al, 2010; Zhao et&#160;al, 2012; Chen &amp; Dorn, 2013; Munoz et&#160;al, 2013; Song et&#160;al, 2015) and a role of mitochondrial dynamics in mitochondrial quality control (Twig et&#160;al, 2008). Moreover, disruption of mitochondrial dynamics has also been shown to be associated with muscle atrophy (Romanello et&#160;al, 2010). Therefore, we suggest that Mfn2 repression during aging leads to alterations in autophagy and to an inhibition of mitochondrial quality control, contributing to the accumulation of damaged mitochondria and muscle atrophy. In keeping with this, re&#8208;expression of Mfn2 in skeletal muscle from Mfn2KO mice restored autophagy and reversed muscle atrophy.</text>

      <text>It is likely that inhibition of autophagy actively participates in many of the alterations detected under muscle Mfn2 deficiency conditions. In this context, treatment of mice with autophagy inhibitor chloroquine caused muscle atrophy as noted by reduced muscle fiber size. Similarly, treatment of muscle cells with autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 caused enhanced ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction. All these data are coherent with the model that muscle Mfn2 repression driven by aging reduces mitochondrial autophagy, which in turn leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and other downstream events such as muscle atrophy or alterations in nutrient handling.</text>

      <text>Surprisingly, we have documented that both normal aging and Mfn2 deficiency cause a mitochondrial retrograde signaling through induction of HIF&#8208;1&#945; in skeletal muscle. This is a cell autonomous response also detectable in cultured muscle cells upon Mfn2 deficiency. HIF1&#945; has been shown to have a role in the activation of mitochondrial autophagy by upregulating BNIP3 (Zhang et&#160;al, 2008; Bellot et&#160;al, 2009). Activation of this pathway involves the induction of BNIP3 and the potentiation of autophagic degradation of mitochondria, thereby minimizing accumulation of damaged mitochondria. Blocking this pathway by a specific HIF1&#945; inhibitor leads to increased mitochondrial damage and metabolic collapse. Moreover, we found that the increase in HIF1&#945; was ROS&#8208;dependent, as treatment of mice or muscle cells with the antioxidant NAC blocked the increase in HIF1&#945; and BNIP3, leading to an increased abundance of damaged mitochondria and reduced mitochondrial metabolism, revealing the importance of the HIF1&#945; retrograde signaling in cell homeostasis. In addition, NAC treatment worsened muscle atrophy in Mfn2KO mice, highlighting the importance of this adaptive pathway in minimizing muscle damage. Blockage of mitochondrial autophagy induced with bafilomycin A1 also led to accumulation of damaged mitochondria, an increase in ROS production, and activation of the HIF1&#945;&#8208;BNIP3 pathway. These data strongly suggest that inhibition of mitochondrial quality control and accumulation of damaged mitochondria is the driver of the activation of the HIF&#8208;1&#945; adaptive retrograde signaling. In keeping with this, a similar adaptive pathway involving ROS&#8208;induced increase in NRF2 and BNIP3 has been recently shown to be activated by accumulation of damaged mitochondria during aging in C.&#160;elegans (Palikaras et&#160;al, 2015), although the mechanisms by which aging leads to accumulation of mitochondrial damage have not been analyzed. Here, we propose that the decrease of Mfn2 could be the link between aging and accumulation of damaged mitochondria. Although HIF1&#945; has&#160;been shown to increase during aging affecting nuclear&#8211;mitochondrial communication (Gomes et&#160;al, 2013), here we discovered a different and previously unknown retrograde signaling pathway triggered by aging&#8208;induced Mfn2 downregulation, which is formed by HIF1&#945;&#8208;BNIP3 in order to minimize mitochondrial damage and muscle atrophy during aging.</text>

      <text>In summary, we propose a model (Fig&#160;7F) in which Mfn2 controls the optimal biological properties of skeletal muscle through the maintenance of mitochondrial quality control and efficient mitochondrial metabolism. During normal aging, skeletal muscle undergoes Mfn2 repression, which causes a reduction in mitochondrial autophagy and therefore a reduction in mitochondrial metabolism resulting in an increase of damaged mitochondria, which leads to an increase in ROS production. Ablation of Mfn2 reproduces those alterations in young mice and aggravates them in old mice, strongly supporting a role for muscle Mfn2 in aging. Surprisingly, the alterations in mitochondrial function induce a mitochondrial retrograde signaling through HIF&#8208;1&#945;, enhanced BNIP3, contributing to the maintenance of mitochondrial autophagy. We also suggest that conditions characterized by extremely reduced muscle Mfn2 are bound to unhealthy aging. Under these conditions, mitochondrial autophagy undergoes a further impairment and leads to the occurrence of more extensive mitochondrial damage. This situation, taken as a whole, causes metabolic alterations linked to an impairment of metabolic homeostasis and low energy expenditure, sarcopenia, and reduced muscle performance. Overall, the data presented here strongly support the view that Mfn2 constitutes a novel target for the treatment of age&#8208;related alterations in skeletal muscle.</text>
