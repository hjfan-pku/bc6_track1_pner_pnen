      <text>The functional role of the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome pathway during maternal&#8208;to&#8208;zygotic transition (MZT) remains to be elucidated. Here we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Rnf114, is highly expressed in mouse oocytes and that knockdown of Rnf114 inhibits development beyond the two&#8208;cell stage. To study the underlying mechanism, we identify its candidate substrates using a 9,000&#8208;protein microarray and validate them using an in vitro ubiquitination system. We show that five substrates could be degraded by RNF114&#8208;mediated ubiquitination, including TAB1. Furthermore, the degradation of TAB1 in mouse early embryos is required for MZT, most likely because it activates the NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway. Taken together, our study uncovers that RNF114&#8208;mediated ubiquitination and degradation of TAB1 activate the NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway during MZT, and thus directly link maternal clearance to early embryo development.</text>

      <text>The earliest stages of embryogenesis are controlled by maternal factors, which include large amounts of mRNA and protein that are accumulated and stored in the cytoplasm of mature oocytes. After fertilization, these maternal factors need to be eliminated to support maternal&#8208;to&#8208;zygotic transition (MZT) and subsequent zygotic genome activation (ZGA) 1, to facilitate the transition from terminally differentiated eggs to pluripotent blastocysts. This drastic cellular renovation process is regulated at both translational and posttranslational levels 2. Previous studies demonstrated that maternal proteins and mRNAs are degraded by massive autophagy after fertilization in mammals 3. The ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system, another major eukaryotic protein degradation system, also plays a critical role during these stages, including pronuclear remodeling, activation of the embryonic genome, and mitotic progression in the early embryo 4, 5, 6. Several E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as Cullin 1, Cullin 4A, and G2E3, are essential for early embryo development in mammals 7, 8, 9. However, the involvement of the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome pathway in maternal clearance and its relationship to MZT are still unclear.</text>

      <text>Recently, large&#8208;scale proteomic profile studies of mouse oocyte at different developmental stages, including the germinal vesicle (GV) stage, the metaphase II (MII) stage, and the fertilized oocytes (zygotes), revealed that the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome pathway may play a very important role during the developmental transition 10, 11. RNF114 (Ring finger 114) protein was identified as one of the predominantly expressed proteins in the later stages of mouse oocytes 11. RNF114, also known as zinc finger protein 313 (ZNF313), belongs to the family of really interesting new gene (RING) domain E3 ubiquitin ligases. Apart from the RING domain, RNF114 was found to contain two C2H2 (Cys(2)&#8208;His(2))&#8208;type zinc fingers, as well as a UIM (ubiquitin&#8208;interacting motif) 12, 13. The ubiquitin ligases typically determine the specificity for substrate ubiquitylation 14. Ubiquitin&#8208;mediated degradation of key regulatory short&#8208;lived proteins plays an important role in basic cellular processes such as cell cycle, cell division, cell death 15, the biogenesis of subcellular organelles, and the differentiation of cells or tissues 16, 17.</text>

      <text>To explore the roles and mechanisms of the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome pathway in maternal clearance, here we studied the functional role of RNF114 during MZT. We found that the knockdown of Rnf114 results in decrease in early embryo developmental competence. By an unbiased screening on a protein microarray with more than 9,000 proteins, we identified 13 potential RNF114 substrates and found that the elimination of one of them, TAB1, is necessary for MZT likely due to the requirement for the activation of the NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway. Our results uncover a novel functional role of RNF114 during MZT, and provide direct coupling evidence about maternal clearance and early embryo development.</text>

      <text>We previously found that RNF114 protein was one of the highly expressed E3 ligases at the later stages in mouse oocytes 11. Here we confirmed that while Rnf114 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in various tissues and organs, it was predominately expressed in oocytes, followed by lung and uterus (Fig 1A). Immunohistochemistry of RNF114 in the ovary also confirmed that RNF114 was mainly expressed in the oocytes (Fig 1B). We then explored the expression pattern of RNF114 from germinal vesicle (GV) to blastocyst stages by immunofluorescence with anti&#8208;RNF114 antibody. The results revealed that RNF114 was distributed in the cytoplasm from GV oocytes to the blastocyst stages (Fig EV1). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Rnf114 is highly expressed in oocytes and in early embryonic development.</text>

      <text>To assess the functional role of RNF114, zygotes were microinjected with specific siRNAs against Rnf114. The knockdown efficiency was confirmed by qRT&#8211;PCR and Western blotting at 24 h after microinjection. We observed an obvious decrease of Rnf114 at both mRNA and protein expression levels in Rnf114 siRNA #1 or #2 injection groups compared with the control group injected with non&#8208;silencing siRNA (Fig 1C). We found that while almost all of the control embryos could normally develop into the four&#8208;cell stage (non&#8208;silencing siRNA, 95%, n = 193; six independent experiments), a considerable percent of the embryos injected with Rnf114 siRNAs could not develop to the four&#8208;cell stage (siRNA1#, 33%, n = 120; siRNA2#, 24%, n = 128; three independent experiments) (Fig 1D and E). These results suggest that RNF114 plays an important role during early embryonic development and might be required for MZT.</text>

      <text>As an E3 ligase 18, RNF114 might regulate MZT by targeting specific substrates. Therefore, the identification of its substrates could provide insight into its mechanisms and physiological functions during MZT. The ProtoArray&#174; Human Protein Microarrays v5.0, which contains over 9,000 immobilized human proteins, provides a useful platform to identify potential substrates of E3 ligases 19, 20. To set up the in vitro ubiquitination system, we expressed and purified recombinant wild&#8208;type and mutant human RNF114 in E. coli, and the critical animo acids (Cys44 and Cys49 in the C3HC4&#8208;type RING domain) of the mutant RNF114 were changed to tryptophan. In the presence of E1, Ubc4, ATP, and FLAG&#8208;tagged ubiquitin (FLAG&#8208;ub), recombinant RNF114 could efficiently catalyze the formation of high molecular weight polyubiquitin chains (Fig 2A), while the mutant RNF114 lacked ubiquitination activity (Fig 2B and C), confirming that this RNF114 mutant could serve as a negative control in the substrate screening procedure.</text>

      <text>To screen potential substrates of RNF114, E1, Ubc4 (E2), and E3 (RNF114 and mutant RNF114) together with biotin&#8211;ubiquitin were profiled on ProtoArray&#174; Human Protein Microarrays. A brief schematic is shown in Fig 2D. The reaction was run in parallel with a negative control array probed with buffer alone and a control in which only E3 was omitted. After incubation with Alexa Fluor&#174;647&#8208;conjugated streptavidin, all arrays were scanned with an Axon 4000B fluorescent scanner (Molecular Devices). A small percentage (less than 0.5%) of the proteins exhibited significant signals in the negative control assay due to interaction with the detection reagent and were eliminated from the analysis. Possible substrates were evaluated by their Z&#8208;score and signal used values within the array and were then compared with the control assay in which E3 was omitted. According to the threshold criteria described in Materials and Methods, 37 proteins were identified to exhibit significant ubiquitination signals with wild&#8208;type RNF114. One of them (HIP1) might be a false positive as it was also detected when mutated RNF114 was used (Table EV1). Because ubiquitin or ubiquitin chains could charge on to some ubiquitin&#8208;conjugating enzymes and can also be recognized by proteins that contain ubiquitin&#8208;binding domains, such as UIM (ubiquitin&#8208;interacting motif), UBA (ubiquitin associated), or CUE (coupling of ubiquitin conjugation to endoplasmic reticulum degradation) domains, proteins with these domains/motifs were excluded from further investigation. Furthermore, proteins without clearly reported functions were also not considered. Thirteen proteins&#8212;CD74, TAB1, TNIP1, TOM1L2, OPTN, TNIP2, EPHA1, NEK10, RALGPS1, RAB3IL1, PSAT1, APPL1, and DCN1&#8212;were selected as candidate substrates of RNF114 for further characterization (Fig 2E and Table EV1).</text>

      <text>All seven lysines in ubiquitin can be used to build polyubiquitin chains with different topologies 21, and polyubiquitin chains with different linkages have distinct structural and functional relevance. Well&#8208;accepted doctrine substrates modified with Lys48 or Lys11 polyubiquitin chains can be targeted to the proteasome for degradation, but this does not apply to other linkages 22, 23. To investigate the linkage specificity of RNF114&#8208;mediated polyubiquitination, wild&#8208;type ubiquitin and mutants with a single lysine changed to arginine (K6R, K11R, K27R, K29R, K33R, K48R, and K63R) or mutants in which only a single lysine was present with all others changed to arginine (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and K63) were used in in vitro ubiquitination assays. As shown in Fig EV2, Lys11, Lys27, and Lys48 were necessary for RNF114&#8208;mediated polyubiquitin chain assembly and Lys11 and Lys27 ubiquitin derivatives were both sufficient for high molecular weight ubiquitin chain formation, indicating that RNF114 assembles heterotypic polyubiquitination chains consisting of K11, K27, and K48 linkages. These data suggest that RNF114 ubiquitination of target substrates might promote their degradation.</text>

      <text>We next established the eukaryotic expression vector containing the open reading frames of the 13 potential RNF114 substrate genes and a N&#8208;terminal FLAG tag. Ten FLAG&#8208;tagged candidate substrates were successfully detected by Western blotting after transfection into HEK293T cells (Fig EV3). The candidate substrate constructs were then co&#8208;transfected into HEK293T cells with RGS&#8208;His&#8208;tagged wild&#8208;type or mutant RNF114. EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) was used as a transfection control. Compared with those co&#8208;transfected with mutant RNF114, the protein expression levels of CD74, TAB1, OPTN, TNIP1, APPL1, PSAT1, and RALGPS1 were clearly reduced in the presence of wild&#8208;type RNF114, while no changes were observed in the remaining three proteins (Fig 3A). These results suggest that RNF114 might regulate the stability of these seven proteins by promoting their ubiquitination and degradation.</text>

      <text>To test the above possibility, we next performed in vitro ubiquitination assays using anti&#8208;FLAG immunoprecipitates from HEK293T cells transfected with the candidate substrate proteins with or without the presence of RNF114. His&#8208;ubiquitin was detected by Western blotting using the anti&#8208;His tag antibody. The results showed that CD74, TAB1, TNIP1, PAST1, and RALGPS1 could be efficiently modified with ubiquitin in a RNF114&#8208;dependent manner (Fig 3B) and suggest that these five proteins may be bona fide substrates of RNF114.</text>

      <text>Next we examined the potential role of these substrates in RNF114 function during MZT. Because knockdown Rnf114 results in the decrease of embryos develop beyond two&#8208;cell stage, the overexpression of its substrate might also cause a similar phenotype if it is a critical substrate of RNF114 in this process. We microinjected in vitro&#8208;transcribed mRNAs of myc&#8208;Cd74, myc&#8208;Tab1, myc&#8208;Tnip1, myc&#8208;Psat1, and myc&#8208;Ralgps1 into zygotes, and the efficient overexpression of exogenous proteins was confirmed by Western blotting using anti&#8208;myc tag antibody (Fig EV4). After 48&#8211;50 h of culture, the zygotes in the control groups developed normally, and approximately 97% reached the four&#8208;cell stage. Zygotes injected with Ralgps1, Cd74, Tnip1, or Psat1 mRNA showed little changes. However, zygotes injected with exogenous Tab1 mRNA showed obvious developmental defects, which were similar to the phenotype caused by Rnf114 knockdown, with 27% of the zygotes arrested at the two&#8208;cell stage (Fig 4A). Western blot analysis showed that during early embryo development, the expression of TAB1 decreased sharply, only weak expression could be detected at two&#8208;cell and four&#8208;cell stages, while when Rnf114 was knocked down by siRNAs, abnormal accumulation of TAB1 was observed (Fig 4B). In support of the two&#8208;cell stage degradation, we found that the endogenous TAB1 could be ubiquitinated at this stage (Fig EV5); furthermore, more Ub signals on TAB1 were detected in the two&#8208;cell&#8208;stage embryos than in the zygotes (Fig 4C), suggesting endogenous TAB1 ubiquitination mainly occurs at two&#8208;cell stage. To investigate whether the degradation of TAB1 was mediated by RNF114, Tab1&#8208;GFP mRNA was injected into zygotes in the condition with or without knockdown RNF114. As expected, the GFP fluorescence signal gradually declined during the early embryo development. However, in the embryos injected with Rnf114 siRNAs, TAB1&#8208;GFP levels remained approximately constant (Fig 4D), suggesting the elimination of TAB1 is indeed dependent on RNF114. Furthermore, when specific siRNA against Tab1 was microinjected into oocytes at GV stage together with Rnf114 siRNA 1#, the two&#8208;cell&#8208;stage arrest defect caused by RNF114 knockdown was partly rescued (Fig 4E). Together, these results suggest that TAB1 might be the major substrate of RNF114 during MZT.</text>

      <text>Next, we addressed the functional role of TAB1 clearance during MZT. TAB1 is a regulator of the MAP kinase kinase kinase MAP3K7/TAK1, which is an intracellular hub molecule that regulates both nuclear factor&#8208;&#954;B (NF&#8208;&#954;B) and mitogen&#8208;activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways 24, 25. These pathways play key roles in development, cell survival, immune response, metabolism, and carcinogenesis 26. A previous study showed that TAB1 knockdown resulted in increased NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway activity, and excess amount of TAK1 blocks the spontaneous NF&#8208;&#954;B activation by a negative feedback manner in some cells 27. The NF&#8208;&#954;B/Rel transcription factors are present in the cytosol in an inactive state coexisted with the inhibitory I&#954;B proteins, while the phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation of I&#954;B&#945; result in the release and nuclear translocation of active RelA (p65) 28, 29, 30. The activation and nuclear translocation of NF&#8208;&#954;B p65/p50 are key steps for the DNA binding of NF&#8208;&#954;B and transcription of downstream target genes 31. Interestingly, activation of the NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway is crucial to the early stage development of the mouse embryo 32. Similar to their results, we found that the NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway was quickly activated during early embryonic development; p65 was mainly located in the cytoplasm at MII and zygote stages, while at the two&#8208;cell stage and thereafter it translocated into the nucleus (Fig 5A). With embryonic development, the protein level of inhibitory subunit I&#954;B&#945; decreased accompanied with upregulated phosphorylated form (p&#8208;I&#954;B&#945;), and the ratio of p&#8208;I&#954;B&#945; to total I&#954;B&#945; increased gradually form MII oocyte to four&#8208;cell stage (Fig 5B). These results provide direct evidence for NF&#8208;&#954;B activation during MZT. Furthermore, zygotes treated with the p65 inhibitor Bay 11&#8208;7082 33 were arrested at the two&#8208;cell stage (Fig 5C). Together, these results suggest that the activation of the NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway might be essential to MZT.</text>

      <text>We then analyzed the involvement of TAB1 and RNF114 in the regulation of NF&#8208;&#954;B activity during MZT. We found that in contrast to the predominant nuclear localization of p65 at the two&#8208;cell stage in embryos derived from control zygotes, p65 nuclear translocation was clearly blocked when either RNF114 was knocked down or TAB1 was overexpressed by Tab1 mRNA microinjection (Fig 5D and E). Western blot of two&#8208;cell&#8208;stage embryos further revealed that the level of p&#8208;I&#954;B&#945; was obviously reduced after RNF114 was knocked down (Fig 5F) or TAB1 was overexpressed (Fig 5G). Taken together, these results suggest that RNF114&#8208;mediated ubiquitination and degradation of TAB1 might be essential to the activation of NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway during MZT, thus directly coupling maternal clearance to early embryo development.</text>

      <text>A previous study reported that RNF114 overexpression could activate the NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway in HEK293T cells 34, while in T cells, it negatively regulates NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway by increasing the stability of A20 and I&#954;B&#945; 35. Our studies provide a novel mechanism for RNF114 function in NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway activation during MZT. The discrepancy for the effect of RNF114 on NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway activation among these studies might be due to the different status of these cells/tissues in response to different stimuli. The functional role of NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway during MZT has been unaddressed for some time as most of the null mutants in the NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway die before sexual maturity 36, thus preventing the study of their effect on MZT.</text>

The microarray contains over 9,000 unique human proteins on a nitrocellulose&#8208;coated glass slide. Wild&#8208;type Rnf114 was profiled in duplicate at 0.15 &#956;g/&#956;l, while mutant Rnf114 was profiled in one reaction. The reactions contained E1 (0.02 &#956;g/&#956;l), E2 (0.05 &#956;g/&#956;l), and biotin&#8211;ubiquitin (0.1 &#956;g/&#956;l). For the control array, only E1 and E2 were used in the reaction. Energy regeneration solution (Boston Biochem) was used at a final concentration of 1&#215;. Slides were blocked in 4&#8208;well QuadriPERM trays with 5 ml blocking buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 0.08% Triton X&#8208;100, 25% glycerol, 20 mM reduced glutathione, 1.0 mM DTT, 1% BSA) for 60 min at 4&#176;C.

      <text>Arrays were scanned with an Axon GenePix 4000B fluorescent scanner (Molecular Devices). Data were acquired with GenePix 6.0 software (Molecular Devices) and processed in ProtoArray&#174; Prospector. Significance call queries were performed by Prospector to identify hits on each protein array. The significance call determines which signals are greater than or equal to a value that is determined by calculating the median plus 3.0 standard deviations (using signal minus background values for all non&#8208;control proteins) for all non&#8208;control proteins on the array. Substrates are defined as proteins having positive significance calls that are not observed on the appropriate negative control. In some cases, hits not identified by the program are counted but only if manually verified by looking at the spots on the arrays. A protein was defined as exhibiting significant ubiquitination signal if it met the following set of threshold criteria: (i) the signal value on the array probed with E3 was least threefold higher than the signal value in the E1/E2 control assay; (ii) Z&#8208;Factor &gt; 0.5, which means the signal is at least twofold above the noise; (iii) the Z&#8208;score or normalized fluorescent signal &gt; 2.0 standard deviations above the mean human protein signal on the corresponding array; (iv) both the replicate spot CV and the inter&#8208;assay CV &lt; 50%; and (v) the CI P&#8208;value &lt; 0.05, correlating with a visually confirmable signal on the array.</text>

      <text>In vitro substrate&#8208;independent ubiquitination assays were conducted as previously described 39. Briefly, ubiquitin&#8208;activating enzyme E1 (0.02 &#956;g/&#956;l), Ubc4 (0.05 &#956;g/&#956;l), WT or mutant RNF114 protein (0.1 &#956;g/&#956;l), FLAG&#8208;tagged ubiquitin (0.1 &#956;g/&#956;l), ATP (0.1 M), and substrate (0.02 &#956;g/&#956;l) were added into buffer containing 50 mM Tris&#8211;HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P&#8208;40, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol. The reactions were incubated at 37&#176;C for various times and then stopped by adding an equal volume of 2&#215; SDS&#8211;PAGE loading buffer. The samples were then resolved by SDS&#8211;PAGE and blotted for ubiquitinated protein products using anti&#8208;FLAG antibody.</text>

      <text>In vitro substrate&#8208;dependent ubiquitination assays were performed with anti&#8208;FLAG immunoprecipitates as described previously 40. In brief, HEK293 cells were transfected with expression vectors of different potential substrate, and the cells extracted were precipitated with anti&#8208;Flag M2 affinity agarose beads (Sigma&#8208;Aldrich, USA). The resulting immunoprecipitates were added into the ubiquitination reaction system described above with or without pGEX&#8208;GST&#8208;Rnf114, His&#8208;tagged ubiquitin was used instead to distinguish with the substrate protein, and the ubiquitinated protein was detected by both anti&#8208;His and anti&#8208;FLAG antibodies.</text>

      <text>The ORFs of Tab1, Tnip1, Ralgps1, Psat1, and Cd74 genes were subcloned into pCS2+ vector, which has a myc tag, allowing in vitro transcription of polyadenylated mRNA 41. In addition, Tab1&#8208;GFP was also cloned into pCS2+ vector. The constructs were linearized by SacII or KpnI and purified using a gel extract kit (Promega). SP6 message machine (Ambion) was used for producing capped mRNAs, and the mRNAs were purified by the RNeasy cleanup kit (Qiagen). Microinjection of mRNAs was performed as previously described 42. The same amount of RNase&#8208;free ddH2O was injected as control. Western blotting was performed using anti&#8208;myc tag antibody to confirm the overexpression of exogenous protein.</text>

      <text>Quantitative analysis of the fluorescence intensity was performed with ImageJ software, which is public&#8208;domain software developed by the National Institute of Health (NIH) in the United States. To measure GFP signal, the area occupied by the embryo in each frame was defined manually, and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the signal within this area was measured. Values were corrected for background fluorescence by subtracting the MFI of the area surrounding the embryo at each time point. To control for the apparent differences in MFI levels between individual embryos caused by discrepancies in the amount of injected mRNA, background&#8208;corrected MFIs were normalized to the intensity measured at the first time point.</text>
