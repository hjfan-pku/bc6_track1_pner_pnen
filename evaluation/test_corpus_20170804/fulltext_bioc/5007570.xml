      <text>Intronic hexanucleotide (G4C2) repeat expansions in C9orf72 are genetically associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The repeat RNA accumulates within RNA foci but is also translated into disease characterizing dipeptide repeat proteins (DPR). Repeat&#8208;dependent toxicity may affect nuclear import. hnRNPA3 is a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein, which specifically binds to the G4C2 repeat RNA. We now report that a reduction of nuclear hnRNPA3 leads to an increase of the repeat RNA as well as DPR production and deposition in primary neurons and a novel tissue culture model that reproduces features of the C9orf72 pathology. In fibroblasts derived from patients carrying extended C9orf72 repeats, nuclear RNA foci accumulated upon reduction of hnRNPA3. Neurons in the hippocampus of C9orf72 patients are frequently devoid of hnRNPA3. Reduced nuclear hnRNPA3 in the hippocampus of patients with extended C9orf72 repeats correlates with increased DPR deposition. Thus, reduced hnRNPA3 expression in C9orf72 cases leads to increased levels of the repeat RNA as well as enhanced production and deposition of DPR proteins and RNA foci.</text>

      <text>Unusual translation of bi&#8208;directionally transcribed intronic hexanucleotide repeats in the absence of ATG initiation codons in all reading frames leads to the generation of five distinct dipeptide repeat proteins (DPR), namely poly&#8208;GA, poly&#8208;GP, poly&#8208;GR, poly&#8208;AP, and poly&#8208;PR 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. DPR accumulate in disease characterizing p62&#8208;positive and TDP&#8208;43&#8208;negative inclusions 1, 2, 3, 4. The G4C2 repeat RNA may trap RNA binding proteins and thus inhibit their normal function 6, 7, 8. Indeed, we recently identified a number of G4C2 repeat binding proteins including hnRNPA1, A2 and A3 6. Strikingly, mutations in hnRNPA1 and A2 cause multisystem proteinopathy and the sites of the pathogenic mutations are conserved in hnRNPA3 9. Moreover, hnRNPA3 accumulates in a subset of p62&#8208;positive inclusions and may be reduced within hippocampal neurons of C9orf72 mutation carriers 6. We therefore investigated if a loss of hnRNPA3 may modulate DPR production and deposition.</text>

RT&#8211;qPCR analysis revealed a corresponding increase of G4C2 repeat RNA upon hnRNPA3 knockdown (Fig 1E). Consistent with this finding, more cells harboring repeat RNA foci were detected (Fig 1F and G).</text>

      <text>hnRNPA3&#8208;mediated repression of G4C2 repeat RNA and poly&#8208;GA protein is dependent on its ability to bind RNA. Whereas ectopic hnRNPA3WT rescued repression of repeat RNA and poly&#8208;GA upon knockdown of endogenous hnRNPA3 (Figs 2A&#8211;C and EV1A and B), a mutant variant, which is unable to bind RNA 10, failed to do so (Fig 2A&#8211;C). Nuclear import of hnRNPA3 also appears to be required since an hnRNPA3 variant lacking a M9 nuclear localization signal (NLS) (mCh&#8208;A3&#916;M9) fails to fully rescue repression of repeat RNA and poly&#8208;GA protein (Fig 2D&#8211;F). The remaining activity is likely due to M9&#8208;NLS independent residual nuclear import of hnRNPA3 (Fig EV1C). Although knockdown of hnRNPA2 fails to increase GA production (Fig 1A and B), hnRNPA2 overexpression restored repression of repeat RNA and poly&#8208;GA (Fig 2B and C). In line with this finding, knockdown of hnRNPA3 together with hnRNPA1 or hnRNPA2 further increased poly&#8208;GA expression suggesting that hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 can partially compensate hnRNPA3 function (Fig EV1D and E). Overall, these findings suggest that hnRNPA3 negatively regulates repeat RNA expression levels, a process, which requires the RNA binding capacity of hnRNPA3 as well as its nuclear import via the M9&#8208;NLS.</text>

      <text>In the above experiments, we only detected the most efficiently translated GA protein 4. To investigate whether production of the other DPRs is also increased by reduced hnRNPA3 expression, we thought to achieve higher repeat RNA levels by expressing 80 G4C2 repeats under the control of the strong CMV promotor (Fig EV2A and B). This indeed allowed detection of poly&#8208;GA, poly&#8208;GP, and poly&#8208;GR in Western blots (Fig EV2C) and by immunocytochemistry (Fig EV2D and E). Moreover, we detected p62&#8208;positive poly&#8208;GA deposits in a subset of cells (Fig 3A). Furthermore, poly&#8208;GA and poly&#8208;GR double&#8208;positive cells, but not poly&#8208;GA single&#8208;positive cells, frequently showed altered TDP&#8208;43 intracellular distribution (Figs 3B and EV3A and B) thus reproducing important pathological features of C9orf72&#8208;associated neuropathology. TDP&#8208;43 redistribution was typically associated with altered nuclear morphology, which may indicate onset of apoptosis. TDP&#8208;43 mislocalization was enhanced in cells, which express both, poly&#8208;GA and poly&#8208;GR (Figs 3B and EV3A and B). In line with the data shown in Fig 1, hnRNPA3 knockdown significantly increased (G4C2)80 repeat RNA (Fig 3C) as well as poly&#8208;GA, poly&#8208;GP, and poly&#8208;GR protein with poly&#8208;GA being the most abundant DPR protein as observed in C9orf72 patients 4 (Fig 3D&#8211;F). Furthermore, co&#8208;expression of two or three different DPRs in one cell was significantly more frequently detected in hnRNPA3&#8208;depleted cells (Fig 3G).</text>

      <text>To test whether reduced hnRNPA3 also leads to enhanced C9orf72&#8208;associated phenotypes under physiological condition without ectopic expression of C9orf72 repeat extensions, we used fibroblast lines derived from three independent and unrelated patients with confirmed C9orf72 repeat extensions (Fig 5A; see also Materials and Methods for further clinical characterization). Since we could not detect DPR expression in primary patient&#8208;derived cells including neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells using several different monoclonal antibodies, we focused on enhanced formation of RNA foci, which consistently accumulate upon hnRNPA3 knockdown in HeLa cells (see Fig 1F and G). Two independent siRNAs efficiently knocked down hnRNPA3 and lowered hnRNPA3 protein levels in all three fibroblast lines (Fig 5B), where RNA foci composed of the repeat RNA could be detected by in situ hybridization (Fig 5C). As a result of lowered hnRNPA3, we observed an approximately two fold increase of cells containing RNA foci (Fig 5D). In addition, hnRNPA3 knockdown significantly increased the number of foci per individual cell (Fig 5E). These findings were independently confirmed using lentiviral&#8208;mediated knockdown (Fig 5F and G). Taken together, these results confirm regulation of the GGGGCC repeat RNA by hnRNPA3 on an endogenous level in patient&#8208;derived primary cells.</text>

      <text>Enhanced generation of poly&#8208;GA deposits and RNA foci in primary neurons and patient's fibroblasts upon hnRNPA3 knockdown prompted us to investigate the link between reduced hnRNPA3 expression and DPR deposition in brains of patients with C9orf72 repeat extensions. To do so, we performed double immunofluorescence with anti&#8208;hnRNPA3 and anti&#8208;GA antibodies in hippocampal sections, where hnRNPA3&#8208;related pathology was most prominent and abundant DPR pathology was observed 3, 4, 6. Two examiners independently analyzed sections from 34 C9orf72 cases. In C9orf72 patients, we frequently detected individual neurons with reduced nuclear hnRNPA3 as well as partial co&#8208;localization of hnRNPA3 with poly&#8208;GA aggregates (Fig 6A and B). When we grouped the cases according to their hnRNPA3 expression levels split at the median, we observed a significant increase in GA deposition in neurons with low hnRNPA3 expression (Fig 6C). Approximately 50% higher levels of poly&#8208;GA deposits in cases with low hnRNPA3 levels are comparable to the effect of hnRNPA3 knockdown of RNA foci in patient fibroblasts (Fig 5). This is also in line with the data derived from cultured cells, where lowering of hnRNPA3 leads to higher levels of poly&#8208;GA.</text>

      <text>Reduced hnRNPA3 increases the levels of the G4C2 repeat RNA in three independent tissue culture systems. As a consequence, DPR production and deposition is elevated as well. This occurs independent of promotor effects, as two different promotors were used to drive ectopic expression G4C2 repeats and controls with an irrelevant reporter protein were included as well. Moreover, in patient&#8208;derived fibroblasts, we also observed an accumulation of RNA foci similar to the results in HeLa cells. These findings suggest that binding of hnRNPA3 to the repeat RNA reduces its stability and thus decreases its levels. Binding of hnRNPA3 to the repeat RNA may lead to a reduction of its secondary structure, which could facilitate its degradation. In line with the emerging evidence that C9orf72 repeat extensions disturb nuclear transport 11, 12, 13, these findings may suggest that C9orf72 repeat&#8208;associated toxicity affects nuclear import of hnRNPA3 and thus triggers a vicious cycle, although a direct effect of repeat&#8208;mediated toxicity on hnRNPA3 nuclear transport remains to be shown. By reducing nuclear hnRNPA3, the repeat RNA stability may be increased with the consequence of enhanced RNA foci formation and DPR deposition, which in turn may further reduce nuclear transport. Regardless whether accumulation of the repeat RNA or the DPRs are more neurotoxic 7, 8, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, lowered nuclear hnRNPA3 levels may thus facilitate neurodegeneration.</text>

      <text>To obtain mCherry&#8208;fusion constructs introduced in Figs 1C and 2A and D, the mCherry coding sequence was first subcloned into HindIII/KpnI sites of pcDNA5FRT/TO vector (mCh vector). The hnRNPA2 coding sequence was subcloned into KpnI/NotI sites of the mCh vector (mCh&#8208;A2 vector). Since the long glycine&#8208;rich region of hnRNPA3 is unstable in bacteria, we designed a codon&#8208;optimized version of hnRNPA3 in which repetitive and secondary structure&#8208;forming sequences were minimized while keeping the primary amino acid sequence intact. The codon&#8208;optimized hnRNPA3 was subcloned into KpnI/NotI sites of the mCh vector (mCh&#8208;A3 vector). A DNA fragment encoding the hnRNP A3 DxD mutant (F78xF80 and F169xF171 to D78xD80 and D169xD171) was synthesized and subcloned into the KpnI/NotI site of the mCh vector (mCh&#8208;A3DxD vector). The hnRNPA3&#916;M9 mutation was obtained by insertion of a stop codon just before the M9 core region (NYSGQQQ340*stop) using PCR mutagenesis (mCh&#8208;A3&#916;M9 vector). The mCherry&#8208;hnRNPA3 fusion constructs are siRNA&#8208;resistant since the corresponding nucleotide sequences were altered during codon optimization.</text>

For EGFP, Primer 1: GCACAAGCTGGAGTACAACTA, Primer 2: TGTTGTGGCGGATCTTGAA, Probe/56&#8208;FAM/AGCAGAAGA/ZEN/ACGGCATCAAGGTGA/3IABkFQ/. A primer/probe set for Human GAPDH, 4326317E (Applied Biosystems) was used as endogenous control. Each sample was paired with no reverse transcription controls showing &lt; 1/2^10 (&#916;CT &gt; 10) signal when compared to reverse transcribed samples, thus excluding contamination of plasmid DNA&#8208;derived signal. Each biological sample was analyzed in duplicate or triplicate. Signals of repeat constructs derived cDNA were normalized to GAPDH cDNA according to the &#916;&#916;CT method.</text>

      <text>In situ hybridization was performed as previously described 23, 24 with slight modifications. 2% paraformaldehyde fixed and perforated cells on glass coverslips were rinsed twice with SSC and then incubated in prehybridization solution (40% formamide (Life Technologies, 15515&#8208;026)/2&#215; SSC, 2.5% BSA) at 55&#176;C for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with hybridization solution (40% formamide, 2&#215; SSC, 0.8 mg/ml tRNA (Roche), 0.8 mg/ml single strand salmon sperm DNA (Sigma&#8208;Aldrich, D7656), 0.16% BSA, 8% Dextran sulfate (Sigma&#8208;Aldrich), 1.6 mM Ribonucleoside vanadyl complex (New England Biolabs, S1402S), 5 mM EDTA, 10 &#956;g/&#956;l 5&#8242; Cy3&#8208;labbeled 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;(CCCCGG)x4 probe (IDT 25)) at 55&#176;C. The following day, cells were sequentially washed in 40% formamide/0.5&#215; SSC for 3 times 30 min each at 55&#176;C and then with 0.5&#215; SSC 3 times 10 min each at room temperature. After a brief rinse with PBS, nuclei were counterstained with 0.5 &#956;g/ml of DAPI for 20 min and then washed with PBS for 3 times 3 min each. Glass coverslips were mounted using Prolong Gold antifade (Life Technologies) and analyzed with LSM710 confocal microscopy with ZEN2011 software (Zeiss).</text>

      <text>Human hippocampal brain sections from 34 cases with C9orf72 repeats and 5 control cases were stained as described previously 3, 4, 6 using anti&#8208;GA, anti&#8208;hnRNPA3 antibodies, and DAPI. Three fluorescent images of the dentate gyrus were obtained from each case using LSM710 (Zeiss) microscope with a 63&#215; oil immersion objective. Raw data tif files of each channel were exported from czi files using Zen2011 software. Quantification was performed using ImageJ software. Binary images from DAPI staining were used for the nuclear regions. Vascular structures were manually excluded from the analysis. Cell numbers of each image were counted. Nuclear hnRNPA3 was defined as hnRNPA3 signal overlapping with DAPI staining. The hnRNPA3 signal from surrounding tissue outside of cell bodies was regarded as background. After subtraction of background, nuclear hnRNPA3 intensities of about 80&#8211;180 granular layer cells/case were quantified in 34 C9orf72 cases. Median nuclear hnRNPA3 intensity (arbitrary unit) of these cells per micrograph was defined as the nuclear hnRNPA3 level of each image. An average of the nuclear hnRNPA3 levels of 3 micrographs from a C9orf72 case was regarded as the nuclear hnRNPA3 level of the case. The 34 C9orf72 mutation cases were then separated at the median of the nuclear hnRNPA3 levels (see also Table EV1) of the 34 cases (cutoff = 4.93) into two groups expressing low or high hnRNPA3 levels (n = 17, 17; mean nuclear hnRNPA3 level &#177; SEM: 10.28 &#177; 2.220 (High), 3.353 &#177; 0.2000 (Low)). There is no statistically significant difference between the two groups in gender (n of male: n of female = 11:6 (A3 High), 11:6 (A3 Low), two&#8208;sided chi&#8208;square test, P = 1.000), age of onset (mean &#177; SEM = 57.0714 &#177; 1.7082 (A3 High), 55.8824 &#177; 1.5502 (A3 Low), two&#8208;sided t&#8208;test, t = &#8722;0.51548, df = 29, P = 0.6101), age of death (mean &#177; SEM = 62.6250 &#177; 1.8835 (A3 High), 61.6471 &#177; 1.8273 (A3 Low), two&#8208;sided t&#8208;test, t = &#8722;0.37266, df = 31, P = 0.7119), disease duration in years (mean &#177; SEM = 4.33571 &#177; 1.2647 (A3 High), 5.73529 &#177; 1.1477 (A3 Low), two&#8208;sided t&#8208;test, t = 0.819517, df = 29, P = 0.4192). Postmortem delays were longer in the high A3 group (mean &#177; SEM = 71.2143 &#177; 9.0220 h (A3 High), 31.8667 &#177; 8.7161 h (A3 Low), two&#8208;sided t&#8208;test, t = &#8722;3.13661, df = 27, P = 0.0041). However, cases #3 and #5 had an exceptionally long postmortem delay of, respectively, 131&#8211;134 h or approximately 190 h. The numbers of poly&#8208;GA aggregates in the same field were counted. The number of poly&#8208;GA inclusions/number of cells &#215;100 was displayed as % poly&#8208;GA positivity of respective cases. Scale bar = 10 &#956;m. Quantification is shown as a bar graph. Single dots represent an average data obtained from three microscopic images from a case.</text>

      <text>CH and KM conceived the research concept. CH coordinated the study. KM performed and analyzed most experiments except the following; KM and YN analyzed human brain tissue. YN and QZ performed the experiments in primary fibroblasts. The experiments using rat primary neuron were designed and performed by QZ, DO, and DE. DE provided materials and valuable conceptual advice. AH and FH established fibroblast lines from three C9orf72 carriers. FK and BN provided important biophysical insights. IRM and TA collected, diagnosed, and provided human brain tissue and supervised neuropathological analyses; the German Consortium for Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration and the Bavarian Brain Banking Alliance identified patients with C9orf72 mutations and provided brains; CH wrote the manuscript together with KM and input from all authors.</text>
