      <text>The c&#8208;Myc proto&#8208;oncogene is activated in more than half of all human cancers. However, the precise regulation of c&#8208;Myc protein stability is unknown. Here, we show that the lncRNA&#8208;MIF (c&#8208;Myc inhibitory factor), a c&#8208;Myc&#8208;induced long non&#8208;coding RNA, is a competing endogenous RNA for miR&#8208;586 and attenuates the inhibitory effect of miR&#8208;586 on Fbxw7, an E3 ligase for c&#8208;Myc, leading to increased Fbxw7 expression and subsequent c&#8208;Myc degradation. Our data reveal the existence of a feedback loop between c&#8208;Myc and lncRNA&#8208;MIF, through which c&#8208;Myc protein stability is finely controlled. Additionally, we show that the lncRNA&#8208;MIF inhibits aerobic glycolysis and tumorigenesis by suppressing c&#8208;Myc and miR&#8208;586.</text>

      <text>The c&#8208;Myc gene was originally discovered as the cellular homolog of the retroviral v&#8208;Myc oncogene 1, 2. The c&#8208;Myc proto&#8208;oncogene was later revealed to be activated in over half of human cancers 3. Many mechanisms are involved in c&#8208;Myc activation during tumorigenesis, including chromosomal rearrangement 4, 5, gene amplification 6, and point mutations in the coding sequence 7, 8. The potent transforming activity of c&#8208;Myc to promote tumorigenesis has been well documented by extensive studies using both in vitro cell culture and in vivo mouse models 9.</text>

      <text>As a master transcriptional factor, c&#8208;Myc has been previously reported to bind to approximately 10&#8211;15% of genes in the genome. Recent studies also suggest that c&#8208;Myc may function as a global amplifier of already active promoters 10, 11, 12. By modulating expression of a variety of protein&#8208;coding genes, c&#8208;Myc has been shown to regulate various cellular processes impacting on cell growth, differentiation, and metabolism 13, 14. However, protein&#8208;coding genes only account for &lt; 2% of the human genome, and the majority of transcripts are non&#8208;coding RNAs 15, 16. Among them are long non&#8208;coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are defined as transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides lacking significant protein&#8208;coding capacity. Thus far, more than 10,000 lncRNAs have been identified in the human genome 15. The lncRNAs are emerging as an important regulator of biological process and have diverse functions including their involvement in the regulation of gene expression at different levels, such as chromatin remodeling, transcription, and post&#8208;transcriptional processing 17, 18. Of note, lncRNA has recently been shown to function as microRNA (miRNA) sponge or competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to regulate gene expression 19, 20. Dysregulation of lncRNAs has also been implicated in a variety of human diseases including cancer 21, 22. Despite these advances, most lncRNAs remain functionally uncharacterized. Particularly, it remains largely unknown how lncRNAs are involved in the regulation of c&#8208;Myc function.</text>

      <text>Considering c&#8208;Myc has strong growth&#8208;promoting ability, so a small change in c&#8208;Myc levels may have a global impact on the cell. It is therefore not surprising that levels of c&#8208;Myc are under extraordinarily tight regulation in normal cells. c&#8208;Myc is an immediate&#8208;early gene, and its transcription is controlled at the level of initiation in response to a range of growth stimuli 23, 24. In addition, c&#8208;Myc mRNA is highly unstable, with a half&#8208;life of ~30 min. The export and translation of c&#8208;Myc mRNA are also highly controlled 25, 26. Furthermore, c&#8208;Myc is a labile protein, and its protein stability is regulated by multiple E3 ubiquitin ligases 27, among which SCF (Skp&#8211;Cullin&#8211;F&#8208;box)&#8208;Fbxw7 (F&#8208;box and WD repeat domain&#8208;containing 7) is the best&#8208;characterized E3 ubiquitin ligase for c&#8208;Myc. The SCF&#8208;Fbxw7&#8208;mediated degradation of c&#8208;Myc involves the recognition of phosphorylated c&#8208;Myc on threonine 58 (T58) and serine 62 (S62) by Fbxw7 28, 29. It has been widely accepted that the c&#8208;Myc oncogene becomes dysregulated when those control mechanisms are compromised.</text>

      <text>The tightly controlled expression of c&#8208;Myc is essential for many cellular processes. Deficiency in c&#8208;Myc is embryonic lethal in animal models, whereas the increased expression of c&#8208;Myc is oncogenic. It is interesting to note that c&#8208;Myc haploinsufficient (Myc+/&#8722;) mice are metabolically healthier and surviving longer than wild&#8208;type mice 30. It is unclear whether this also holds true for human beings. In normal human cells, c&#8208;Myc is kept at a relatively low level, whereas c&#8208;Myc exhibits high&#8208;level expression in cancer cells. How this is achieved in their respective cells has not yet been fully addressed.</text>

      <text>In this study, we demonstrate that lncRNA&#8208;MIF (Myc inhibitory factor), which is transcribed by c&#8208;Myc, is able to reduce c&#8208;Myc expression. Mechanistically, lncRNA&#8208;MIF competes with coding mRNA Fbxw7 for miR&#8208;586 and relieves the inhibitory effect of miR&#8208;586 on Fbxw7, thereby leading to increased Fbxw7 expression and decreased c&#8208;Myc level. Our data indicate the existence of a feedback loop between c&#8208;Myc and lncRNA&#8208;MIF, through which c&#8208;Myc protein stability is delicately controlled. Our study also suggests that lncRNA&#8208;MIF exerts its tumor&#8208;suppressive function by regulating c&#8208;Myc&#8208;mediated glycolysis and tumorigenesis.</text>

      <text>To identify novel long non&#8208;coding RNAs involved in the regulation of c&#8208;Myc function, we first analyzed lncRNA expression profile of P493&#8208;6 cells carrying a c&#8208;Myc tet&#8208;off system. By performing long non&#8208;coding RNA microarray analysis (Dataset EV1), we found that levels of three lncRNAs in P493&#8208;6 cells were decreased when c&#8208;Myc expression was suppressed by doxycycline addition (Fig EV1A). Among these c&#8208;Myc responsive lncRNAs, RP11&#8208;320M2.1 (ENST00000547349) particularly attracted our attention because knockdown of this lncRNA showed the most pronounced elevation of c&#8208;Myc in HeLa, H1299 and A549 cells (Figs 1A and EV1B). We named this lncRNA as c&#8208;Myc&#8208;inhibitory factor (lncRNA&#8208;MIF). To avoid off&#8208;target effect, three different lncRNA&#8208;MIF shRNA&#8208;1, &#8208;2, and &#8208;3 were used to knock down lncRNA&#8208;MIF, and each shRNA was shown to result in marked decrease in lncRNA&#8208;MIF and elevated c&#8208;Myc protein level (Fig 5D, lanes 2, 3, and 4, second panel from the top). Furthermore, knockdown effect on upregulation of c&#8208;Myc by lncRNA&#8208;MIF shRNA&#8208;1 and &#8208;2 can be rescued by overexpressed shRNA&#8208;1 and &#8208;2 resistant lncRNA&#8208;MIF (Fig EV1C and D). These results demonstrated that lncRNA&#8208;MIF shRNA&#8208;1 and &#8208;2 will not be off&#8208;targeting. LncRNA&#8208;MIF shRNA&#8208;1 showed the strongest suppression of lncRNA&#8208;MIF and therefore was used throughout this study. LncRNA&#8208;MIF was expressed from a locus between ODC1 and NOL10, and was predicted to have three exons by UCSC (University of California, Santa Cruz) Genome Browser (Fig 1B). LncRNA&#8208;MIF was readily detectable by Northern blotting in HeLa and HCT116 cells, and was approximately 800 bp in length that was the same as predicted by UCSC (Fig 1C). When lncRNA&#8208;MIF was introduced into HeLa cells, c&#8208;Myc levels were greatly reduced (Fig 1D). However, overexpression of lncRNA&#8208;MIF&#8208;AS (antisense) in HeLa cells showed no effect on c&#8208;Myc (Fig 5A, lanes 2 and 3, second panel from the top). These data indicate that lncRNA&#8208;MIF is fully functional for its inhibitory effect on c&#8208;Myc expression.</text>

      <text>We next investigated how lncRNA&#8208;MIF decreased c&#8208;Myc protein levels. c&#8208;Myc mRNA levels were not affected by either overexpression or knockdown of lncRNA&#8208;MIF (Figs 1E and 5C and E), as determined by real&#8208;time RT&#8211;PCR analysis. However, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 was able to reverse the inhibitory effect of lncRNA&#8208;MIF on c&#8208;Myc protein level (Fig 1F and G). c&#8208;Myc half&#8208;life was decreased by lncRNA&#8208;MIF induction and increased by lncRNA&#8208;MIF knockdown (Fig 1H&#8211;K). These data suggest that lncRNA&#8208;MIF reduces c&#8208;Myc protein stability by promoting its degradation through the proteasome pathway.</text>

      <text>Since lncRNA&#8208;MIF was identified as a c&#8208;Myc upregulated gene by lncRNA microarray as mentioned above, we sought to further validate the effect of c&#8208;Myc on lncRNA&#8208;MIF expression. The real&#8208;time RT&#8211;PCR analysis showed that levels of lncRNA&#8208;MIF were greatly decreased when c&#8208;Myc expression was suppressed in P493&#8208;6 cells (Fig 2A). Knockdown of c&#8208;Myc decreased, whereas induction of c&#8208;Myc increased lncRNA&#8208;MIF expression in HeLa, HCT116, and MCF10A cells (Fig 2B and C). Level of c&#8208;Myc protein is subjected to change due to environmental stresses. To examine whether c&#8208;Myc indeed regulates lncRNA&#8208;MIF under physiological conditions, the level of lncRNA&#8208;MIF was determined in glucose&#8208; or glutamine&#8208;deprived HeLa cells which was known to reduce c&#8208;Myc level 31. As shown in Fig EV2A and B, as the c&#8208;Myc level decreased under glucose or glutamine deprivation, the level of lncRNA&#8208;MIF was markedly decreased. These data suggest that lncRNA&#8208;MIF expression is indeed positively regulated by c&#8208;Myc.</text>

      <text>We next explored whether c&#8208;Myc could regulate lncRNA&#8208;MIF at the transcriptional level. We inspected the genomic sequence upstream and intronic regions of the gene coding for lncRNA&#8208;MIF by using Target Scan web server. Three putative c&#8208;Myc binding sites (MIF1, MIF2, and MIF3) were found within the promoter and intronic region of the lncRNA&#8208;MIF gene (Figs 1B and 2D). We therefore evaluated whether these putative c&#8208;Myc binding sites conferred c&#8208;Myc&#8208;dependent transcriptional activity. DNA fragments containing wild&#8208;type or mutant binding sites were inserted into the promoter region of a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid. Luciferase expression from the reporter containing individual MIF1, MIF2, or MIF3 site was indeed induced by ectopic expression of c&#8208;Myc (Fig 2E) and decreased by knockdown of c&#8208;Myc (Fig 2F). Similarly, P493&#8208;6 cells with Myc&#8208;off also result in decreased luciferase expression from three reporter vectors containing MIF1, MIF2, or MIF3 site (Fig 2G). Yet, mutant sites showed no response to c&#8208;Myc induction (Fig 2E&#8211;G). The subsequent chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) assays also verified the association of c&#8208;Myc and the chromatin fragments corresponding to the MIF1, MIF2, or MIF3 site (Fig 2H). As a transcription factor, c&#8208;Myc heterodimerizes with its partner protein Max to bind to conserved E&#8208;box to transactive target genes. We showed that depletion of Max diminished the effect of c&#8208;Myc on lncRNA&#8208;MIF transcription (Fig EV2C), implying that c&#8208;Myc transactivates lncRNA&#8208;MIF via conserved E&#8208;box.</text>

      <text>It has been recognized that stability of c&#8208;Myc is tightly controlled by Fbxw7&#8208;dependent ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome&#8208;dependent degradation. The above finding that lncRNA&#8208;MIF reduced c&#8208;Myc half&#8208;life (Fig 1H&#8211;K) led us to test the possibility that whether lncRNA&#8208;MIF could interact with c&#8208;Myc and/or Fbxw7 and thus to accelerate Fbxw7&#8208;mediated c&#8208;Myc degradation. We performed two types of RNA&#8208;pull&#8208;down experiments. Firstly, we incubated in vitro&#8208;synthesized full&#8208;length biotinylated lncRNA&#8208;MIF (antisense lncRNA&#8208;MIF transcripts were used as negative control) with HeLa cell lysates and isolated coprecipitated proteins by using streptavidin beads. Secondly, we incubated biotinylated antisense DNA probes targeted to lncRNA&#8208;MIF with HeLa cell lysates to pull down endogenous lncRNA&#8208;MIF and its interacting protein (sense DNA probes were used as negative control). The results showed no obvious interaction of lncRNA&#8208;MIF with either Fbxw7 or c&#8208;Myc (Fig 3A; PTBP1 was used as positive control, since PTBP1 was also shown to associate with lncRNA&#8208;MIF in our mass spectrometry analysis). However, we found that knockdown of lncRNA&#8208;MIF decreased, whereas induction of lncRNA&#8208;MIF increased both Fbxw7 mRNA and protein levels (Fig 3B and C). These data indicate that lncRNA&#8208;MIF may decrease c&#8208;Myc half&#8208;life via elevating Fbxw7 expression. We next explored how lncRNA&#8208;MIF regulated Fbxw7 expression. Since there is no direct association between lncRNA&#8208;MIF and Fbxw7, we asked whether lncRNA&#8208;MIF could act as a microRNA sponge to regulate Fbxw7 expression. To test this possibility, we first performed the bioinformatics analysis using TargetScanHuman web server and miR&#8208;586 was predicted to target both lncRNA&#8208;MIF and Fbxw7 (Fig 3D). The RNA target specificities of miRNAs in animals are primarily encoded within a 7&#8208;nt &#8220;seed region&#8221; mapping to positions 2&#8211;8 at the molecule's 5&#8242; end 32. LncRNA&#8208;MIF has five putative 7&#8208;mer complementary sequences for miR&#8208;586, and two of five have 7&#8208;nt perfect match, whereas the remaining three have 1 base variation. Concurrently, the 3&#8242; untranslated region (3&#8242; UTR) of the Fbxw7 gene contains one putative 8&#8208;mer site (nucleotides 636&#8211;643) that matches to the miR&#8208;586 seed region. We next determined whether lncRNA&#8208;MIF interacted with miR&#8208;586 and whether miR&#8208;586 targeted Fbxw7 to inhibit its translation. We showed that both biotinylated antisense DNA probe&#8208;enriched endogenous lncRNA&#8208;MIF and in vitro&#8208;synthesized biotinylated lncRNA&#8208;MIF were able to successfully pull down miR&#8208;586 (Fig 3E and F). As a negative control, lncRNA&#8208;MIF failed to pull down miR&#8208;34a (Fig 3F), since does not contain any putative miR&#8208;34a complementary sequence. To further validate the association of lncRNA&#8208;MIF with miR&#8208;586, we constructed a luciferase reporter plasmid containing wild&#8208;type lncRNA&#8208;MIF and a mutant reporter construct in which two putative miR&#8208;586 binding sites within lncRNA&#8208;MIF were mutated (Fig 3G). These reporter constructs were transfected into HeLa cells together with miR&#8208;586 mimics or inhibitors. As was expected, miR&#8208;586 mimics reduced, whereas miR&#8208;586 inhibitors increased the reporter activity of the construct containing wild&#8208;type lncRNA&#8208;MIF (Fig 3H and I). On the contrary, activity of the reporter containing mutant lncRNA&#8208;MIF was not affected by either mimics or inhibitors of miR&#8208;586 (Fig 3H and I). These results strongly suggest the specific interaction of lncRNA&#8208;MIF with miR&#8208;586. To investigate in which cellular compartment the lncRNA&#8208;MIF&#8211;miR&#8208;586 interaction occurs, we examined the cellular localization of lncRNA&#8208;MIF and miR&#8208;586. LncRNA&#8208;MIF and miR&#8208;586 reside in both cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig 3J). Antisense DNA probe&#8208;enriched endogenous lncRNA&#8208;MIF can only pull down miR&#8208;586 from cytosolic but not nuclear fraction (Fig 3K). Taken together, these data indicate that lncRNA&#8208;MIF specifically interacts with miR&#8208;586 in cytoplasm.</text>

      <text>To determine whether Fbxw7 is a bona fide target of miR&#8208;586, we introduced miR&#8208;586 mimics into HeLa cells together with luciferase reporter plasmids containing wild&#8208;type or mutant 3&#8242; UTR of Fbxw7 (Fig 4A). The reporter activity was noticeably suppressed by the presence of miR&#8208;586 mimics, however, this activity remained largely unaffected when this 3&#8242; UTR was mutated (Fig 4B). In addition, the Fbxw7 3&#8242; UTR&#8208;luciferase activity was increased by treatment with miR&#8208;586 inhibitors (Fig 4C). These data indicate that 3&#8242; UTR of Fbxw7 is inhibited by miR&#8208;586. To reinforce this conclusion, we performed an endogenous experiment. Treatment by miR&#8208;586 mimics led to a decrease in both protein and mRNA levels of endogenous Fbxw7, whereas miR&#8208;586 inhibitors showed the opposite effect (Fig 4D and E). Taken together, these data suggest that Fbxw7 is post&#8208;transcriptionally inhibited by miR&#8208;586.</text>

      <text>Given that miR&#8208;586 was able to target both lncRNA&#8208;MIF and Fbxw7, we asked whether lncRNA&#8208;MIF competed with Fbxw7 mRNA for miR&#8208;586 binding. If there indeed exists a competition between lncRNA&#8208;MIF and Fbxw7 mRNA for shared miR&#8208;586, the copy number ratio of lncRNA&#8208;MIF to miR&#8208;586 is then expected to be within a rational range, too high or too low will make the competition become unworkable. We used quantitative real&#8208;time PCR to quantify the copy numbers of lncRNA&#8208;MIF and miR&#8208;586 per cell in HeLa, MCF7, and HCT116 cells. The ratio of miR&#8208;586 copy number to lncRNA&#8208;MIF copy number ranged from 5 to 20 in different types of cells (Fig 4F). Considering lncRNA&#8208;MIF has 5 putative miR&#8208;586 complementary sites, it is reasonable to speculate that lncRNA&#8208;MIF is able to efficiently inhibit miR&#8208;586 function. We also found that overexpression of lncRNA&#8208;MIF reduced, whereas knockdown of lncRNA&#8208;MIF increased levels of miR&#8208;586 (Fig 4G). To further determine whether lncRNA&#8208;MIF regulates Fbxw7 and c&#8208;Myc expression via miR&#8208;586, miR&#8208;586 mimics and inhibitor were utilized. We showed that induction of miR&#8208;586 by its mimics greatly reversed lncRNA&#8208;MIF&#8208;mediated up&#8208;regulation of Fbxw7 and down&#8208;regulation of c&#8208;Myc (Fig 4H). In addition, lncRNA&#8208;MIF knockdown&#8208;caused Fbxw7 down&#8208;regulation and c&#8208;Myc up&#8208;regulation were strongly minimized by miR&#8208;586 inhibitor (Fig 4I). Furthermore, ectopic expression of lncRNA&#8208;MIF or lncRNA&#8208;MIF harboring nonsense mutations was shown to up&#8208;regulate Fbxw7 and down&#8208;regulate c&#8208;Myc, whereas overexpression of miR&#8208;586 binding&#8208;defective lncRNA&#8208;MIF which had lost the ability to bind miR&#8208;586 showed no effect on either Fbxw7 or c&#8208;Myc (Fig 4J and K). All together, our data suggest that lncRNA&#8208;MIF functions as miR&#8208;586 sponge and attenuates the inhibitory effect of miR&#8208;586 on Fbxw7, thereby leading to elevated Fbxw7 and reduced c&#8208;Myc.</text>

      <text>Actually, there are two major isoforms of lncRNA RP11&#8208;320M2.1. LncRNA&#8208;MIF is isoform 001, which is largely overlapped with a longer isoform 002 named as lncRNA&#8208;MIF&#8208;L (long). We found that c&#8208;Myc did not affect lncRNA&#8208;MIF&#8208;L (Fig EV3A and B). Moreover, the copy number of lncRNA&#8208;MIF&#8208;L was only 2% of that in MCF7, HeLa, or H1299 cells (Fig EV3C). These results indicate that lncRNA&#8208;MIF&#8208;L will have little, if any, sponge effect on miR&#8208;586. We also knocked down lncRNA&#8208;MIF&#8208;L in HeLa cells and showed it did not affect the level of miR&#8208;586, FBXW7, or c&#8208;Myc (Fig EV3D and E). Based on these results, lncRNA&#8208;MIF&#8208;L is unlikely to serve as a ceRNA for miR&#8208;586.</text>

      <text>The substrates of Fbxw7 include several widely studied proteins such as cyclin E1, c&#8208;Myc, and c&#8208;Jun 33. In addition to c&#8208;Myc, we demonstrated that lncRNA&#8208;MIF also affected c&#8208;Jun, which was required for progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. When lncRNA&#8208;MIF was introduced into HeLa cells, c&#8208;Myc and c&#8208;Jun protein but not mRNA levels were greatly reduced (Fig 5A and C). However, lncRNA&#8208;MIF&#8208;AS had no effect on either c&#8208;Myc or c&#8208;Jun (Fig 5A and C). Consistently, depletion of lncRNA&#8208;MIF by lncRNA&#8208;MIF shRNA&#8208;1, &#8208;2, and &#8208;3 led to an increase in c&#8208;Myc and c&#8208;Jun protein but not mRNA levels (Fig 5D and E). Interestingly, lncRNA&#8208;MIF showed no effect on cyclin E1 (Fig 5A, C, D and E).</text>

      <text>c&#8208;Myc has been well known for its ability to promote the glycolysis under normoxia through transcriptionally regulating its target genes involved in the glycolysis pathway. Given that lncRNA&#8208;MIF was able to decrease c&#8208;Myc protein level, we sought to determine whether lncRNA&#8208;MIF could inhibit the glycolysis. Knockdown of lncRNA&#8208;MIF led to the acidification of the culture medium, whereas overexpression of lncRNA&#8208;MIF showed the opposite phenotype (Fig 6A). Consistent with these, knockdown of lncRNA&#8208;MIF reduced, whereas overexpression of lncRNA&#8208;MIF increased c&#8208;Myc target genes involved in the glycolysis pathway such as GLUT1, LDHA, PKM2, and HK2 (Fig 6B). To further confirm the effect of lncRNA&#8208;MIF on the glycolysis, we examined the glucose uptake and lactate production in HeLa cells with overexpression or knockdown of lncRNA&#8208;MIF. We found that lncRNA&#8208;MIF induction led to a strong decrease in glucose uptake and lactate production (Fig 6C and D). In contrast, lncRNA&#8208;MIF knockdown increased glucose uptake and lactate production (Fig 6E and F). These data strongly indicate that lncRNA&#8208;MIF inhibits the glycolysis. We next investigated whether miR&#8208;586 mediated the inhibitory effect of lncRNA&#8208;MIF on the glycolysis. Induction of miR&#8208;586 by its mimics markedly recovered lncRNA&#8208;MIF&#8208;decreased glucose uptake and lactate production (Fig 6C and D). Also, knockdown of miR&#8208;586 by its inhibitors greatly reversed lncRNA&#8208;MIF knockdown&#8208;increased glucose uptake and lactate production (Fig 6E and F). These results indicate that lncRNA&#8208;MIF inhibits the glycolysis via miR&#8208;586.</text>

A marked inhibition of cell proliferation was observed in HeLa cells expressing lncRNA&#8208;MIF, but not expressing lncRNA&#8208;MIF&#8208;AS or control RNA (Fig 7A). Growth rates of HeLa cells expressing control shRNA, lncRNA&#8208;MIF shRNA&#8208;1, &#8208;2, and &#8208;3 were also measured. HeLa cells expressing lncRNA&#8208;MIF shRNA&#8208;1, &#8208;2, or &#8208;3 exhibited higher growth rate than HeLa cells expressing control shRNA (Fig 7B), indicating that lncRNA&#8208;MIF inhibits cell proliferation. Moreover, knockdown of c&#8208;Myc nullified the effect of MIF depletion on cell growth rate (Fig EV4), indicating that the effect of lncRNA&#8208;MIF on cell proliferation is dependent on c&#8208;Myc.</text>

To test this possibility, we performed the colony formation assay. As was expected, ectopic expression of lncRNA&#8208;MIF decreased the number of colonies from control HeLa cells, but not that from miR&#8208;586&#8208;overexpressing HeLa cells (Fig 8A). In addition, knockdown of lncRNA&#8208;MIF increased the number of colonies from control HeLa cells, but not from miR&#8208;586 knockdown HeLa cells (Fig 8B). Together, these results suggest that lncRNA&#8208;MIF inhibits cell proliferation via miR&#8208;586.</text>

      <text>To further determine whether lncRNA&#8208;MIF regulates tumorigenesis, we used a xenograft mouse model. HeLa cells stably expressing exogenous lncRNA&#8208;MIF or lncRNA&#8208;MIF shRNA were injected subcutaneously into the dorsal flanks of the nude mice (n = 7 for each group). Three weeks after injection, mice were sacrificed and tumors were excised. Knockdown of lncRNA&#8208;MIF indeed increased tumorigenicity of HeLa cells (Fig 8C and D). In contrast, induction of lncRNA&#8208;MIF suppressed HeLa cell tumorigenicity (Fig 8C and D). We further examined the expression levels of lncRNA&#8208;MIF and miR&#8208;586 in patients' colorectal carcinoma and their para&#8208;carcinoma tissues. Both lncRNA&#8208;MIF and miR&#8208;586 in carcinoma tissues exhibited higher expression compared with that in para&#8208;carcinoma tissues (Fig EV5A). Based on the TCGA dataset, we found that lncRNA&#8208;MIF expression level was higher in head and neck carcinoma than normal tissues (Fig EV5B).</text>

      <text>Cellular levels of c&#8208;Myc are nevertheless prone to fluctuation with the ever&#8208;changing environment, which may yield global effects on cells. How c&#8208;Myc level is regulated under physiological and/or cancerous conditions remains an unaddressed question. LncRNAs have recently attracted a lot of attention due to their abundance in the genome and biological significance in gene regulation. In this study, we show that as a target gene of c&#8208;Myc, lncRNA&#8208;MIF acts as a non&#8208;coding ceRNA (competing endogenous RNA) to compete with Fbxw7 mRNA for miR&#8208;586 and relieves the inhibitory effect of miR&#8208;586 on Fbxw7. This in turn increases Fbxw7 and accelerates Fbxw7&#8208;dependent degradation of c&#8208;Myc (Fig 8D). These data suggest that lncRNA&#8208;MIF suppresses c&#8208;Myc expression via absorbing more miR&#8208;586 to up&#8208;regulate Fbxw7, an E3 ligase for c&#8208;Myc. As a transcriptional factor, c&#8208;Myc is able to modulate expression of a large number of target genes and regulate multiple cellular processes including metabolism 34. Recent studies have shown that many newly identified lncRNAs and microRNAs are c&#8208;Myc target genes 35, 36, 37, 38. The c&#8208;Myc&#8208;responsive lncRNAs are able to regulate cancer cell proliferation and invasion 39, 40, 41, 42, 43. We here also show that as a novel transcript by c&#8208;Myc, lncRNA&#8208;MIF strongly inhibits the glycolysis as well as tumor formation in nude mice. Taken together, these findings imply lncRNAs can serve as a novel class of tumor suppressive non&#8208;coding RNAs controlling c&#8208;Myc&#8208;driven tumorigenesis.</text>

      <text>Despite that lncRNAs expression can be regulated by c&#8208;Myc, several lncRNAs have recently been shown to regulate c&#8208;Myc expression at multiple levels. For example, lncRNA&#8208;CCAT1&#8208;L (colon cancer&#8208;associated transcript 1, the long isoform) is able to promote Myc transcription via establishing an intra&#8208;chromosome looping between Myc and its upstream enhancer element 44. LncRNA&#8208;GHET1 (gastric carcinoma high expressed transcript 1) promotes gastric carcinoma cell proliferation by increasing c&#8208;Myc mRNA stability 45. LncRNA&#8208;GAS5 (growth arrest&#8208;specific transcript 5) binds to c&#8208;Myc mRNA and suppresses c&#8208;Myc translation via cooperating with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) 46. LncRNA&#8208;PCAT1 (prostate cancer&#8208;associated transcript 1) post&#8208;transcriptionally regulates c&#8208;Myc expression by abrogating the down&#8208;regulation of c&#8208;Myc by miR&#8208;34a 47. In addition, lncRNA&#8208;PVT1 (plasmacytoma variant translocation 1) increases protein expression of c&#8208;Myc via reducing its phosphorylation at threonine 58 (Thr58) and protecting it from proteasome&#8208;dependent degradation 48. In our study, we show that lncRNA&#8208;MIF is able to negatively regulate c&#8208;Myc expression by acting as miR&#8208;586 sponge to increase Fbxw7 expression. Our findings therefore uncover a novel mechanism that depends on both long and small non&#8208;coding RNAs to control c&#8208;Myc stability, and add another layer of complexity to the c&#8208;Myc regulation.</text>

      <text>c&#8208;Myc is also known to be dysregulated in a variety of human cancers, and many of them are addicted to c&#8208;Myc oncogenic signaling 49. c&#8208;Myc is believed to be a promising target for treatment of cancer 50. A casual link between lncRNAs and human cancer has been clearly established as many lncRNAs are dysregulated in various human cancers 21, 51. By suppressing c&#8208;Myc expression, lncRNA&#8208;MIF plays an important role in inhibiting aerobic glycolysis and tumorigenesis. As shown above, lncRNA&#8208;MIF overexpression decreases, whereas lncRNA&#8208;MIF knockdown increases tumorigenicity of HeLa cells. In addition, lncRNA&#8208;MIF down&#8208;regulates c&#8208;Jun, which has important function in progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle, demonstrating that lncRNA&#8208;MIF is able to inhibit cancer cell proliferation via cell cycle arrest. These data suggest that lncRNA&#8208;MIF may represent a potential candidate for cancer therapy.</text>

      <text>In summary, our findings in this study have uncovered a long non&#8208;coding RNA lncRNA&#8208;MIF, which links c&#8208;Myc transcription and its degradation. When c&#8208;Myc is overexpressed, it drives transcription of lncRNA&#8208;MIF, which functions as molecular sponge to absorb more cytosolic miR&#8208;586, thus leading to reduction in miR&#8208;586&#8208;mediated translational repression of Fbxw7. Conversely, in the case where c&#8208;Myc is reduced, lncRNA&#8208;MIF transcription is attenuated, which leads to increased free miR&#8208;586 in the cytosol that in turn triggers down&#8208;regulation of Fbxw7. Whether the c&#8208;Myc&#8211;MIF&#8211;miR586&#8211;Fbxw7 may represent a novel mechanism to regulate c&#8208;Myc protein homeostasis still awaits further investigation. We realize that there are many other uncharacterized factors which are involved in the regulation of c&#8208;Myc stability besides lncRNA&#8208;MIF, Fbxw7, or miR&#8208;586.</text>
