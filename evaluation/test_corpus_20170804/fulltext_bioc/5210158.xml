      <text>Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are inherited diseases characterized by lysosomal dysfunction and often showing a neurodegenerative course. There is no cure to treat the central nervous system in LSDs. Moreover, the mechanisms driving neuronal degeneration in these pathological conditions remain largely unknown. By studying mouse models of LSDs, we found that neurodegeneration develops progressively with profound alterations in presynaptic structure and function. In these models, impaired lysosomal activity causes massive perikaryal accumulation of insoluble &#945;&#8208;synuclein and increased proteasomal degradation of cysteine string protein &#945; (CSP&#945;). As a result, the availability of both &#945;&#8208;synuclein and CSP&#945; at nerve terminals strongly decreases, thus inhibiting soluble NSF attachment receptor (SNARE) complex assembly and synaptic vesicle recycling. Aberrant presynaptic SNARE phenotype is recapitulated in mice with genetic ablation of one allele of both CSP&#945; and &#945;&#8208;synuclein. The overexpression of CSP&#945; in the brain of a mouse model of mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA, a severe form of LSD, efficiently re&#8208;established SNARE complex assembly, thereby ameliorating presynaptic function, attenuating neurodegenerative signs, and prolonging survival. Our data show that neurodegenerative processes associated with lysosomal dysfunction may be presynaptically initiated by a concomitant reduction in &#945;&#8208;synuclein and CSP&#945; levels at nerve terminals. They also demonstrate that neurodegeneration in LSDs can be slowed down by re&#8208;establishing presynaptic functions, thus identifying synapse maintenance as a novel potentially druggable target for brain treatment in LSDs.</text>

      <text>Lysosomes are cellular organelles, which play a key role in the digestion and recycling processes of the cell (Settembre et&#160;al, 2013). The decline of lysosomal function is a central event in a wide range of neuropathological conditions (Nixon et&#160;al, 2008; Nixon, 2013; Fraldi et&#160;al, 2016). Among these lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of severe disorders often affecting patients in early childhood with an overall incidence of 1 in 5,000 (Suzuki, 2002). LSDs are caused by inherited defects of either lysosomal or non&#8208;lysosomal proteins and are characterized by both the accumulation of undegraded material into the lysosomes and global impairment of lysosomal function (Platt et&#160;al, 2012; Boustany, 2013). Central nervous system (CNS) involvement represents one of the most important clinical features in LSDs and a major target for any effective therapeutic protocol. However, to date, there is no cure that can treat the CNS in LSDs and existing protocols, mostly based on correcting/replacing the defective gene/protein, have shown substantial inefficacy. Thus, there is an urgent need to improve CNS therapy in LSDs for clinical purposes.</text>

      <text>The general lysosomal impairment in LSDs occurs independently from the specific genetic deficiency and triggers neurodegenerative processes by mechanisms that are only partially understood (Schultz et&#160;al, 2011; Fraldi et&#160;al, 2016). In particular, how the failure of lysosomal system impacts on specific neuronal functions and how this contributes to neurodegenerative processes remain largely unknown. A better understanding of these pathways may open new therapeutic interventions in LSDs and, more in general, in other neurodegenerative conditions with lysosomal involvement.</text>

      <text>Presynaptic nerve terminals are deeply specialized area of neuronal cells that sustains central nervous system (CNS) activity through the neurotransmission (Murthy &amp; De Camilli, 2003). Neurotransmitter release is mediated by the consecutive recycling of synaptic vesicles, a process that requires a continuous turnover of synaptic proteins (Fernandez&#8208;Alfonso &amp; Ryan, 2006). Growing evidence indicates that presynaptic terminals may initiate neurodegeneration (Kramer &amp; Schulz&#8208;Schaeffer, 2007; Scheff et&#160;al, 2007; Nemani et&#160;al, 2010; Lundblad et&#160;al, 2012). However, whether presynaptic deficits may be involved in neurodegenerative processes associated with lysosomal dysfunction is still unexplored.</text>

      <text>By studying models of LSDs, we demonstrated that the failure of lysosomal system in neurons disrupts the homeostasis of the machinery involved in the synaptic vesicle recycling, thus severely affecting presynaptic integrity and contributing to neurodegenerative processes. Our findings identify synaptic maintenance as a new target for the treatment of LSDs, thus having important implications in the therapy for these diseases.</text>

      <text>Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS&#8208;IIIA) is caused by deficiency in the lysosomal hydrolase sulfamidase (SGSH) and represents one of the most common and severe forms of LSDs (Valstar et&#160;al, 2010). In MPS&#8208;IIIA mice, lysosomal degradation defect leads to progressive lysosomal dysfunction and neurodegeneration, which give rise to the first signs of neurological impairments at around 6&#160;months of age and become more and more severe as the mice age (Bhaumik et&#160;al, 1999; Hemsley &amp; Hopwood, 2005; Fraldi et&#160;al, 2007; Lau et&#160;al, 2008). Therefore, MPS&#8208;IIIA mice represent an optimal model to study the pathogenic cascade of events underlying neuronal degeneration in LSDs. We first examined the architecture of presynaptic terminals in the brain of MPS&#8208;IIIA mice at different ages using electron microscopy (EM) ultrastructure analysis. In 10&#8208;month&#8208;old MPS&#8208;IIIA mice, although the average size of synaptic vesicles remained unchanged compared to WT mice, their number drastically decreased in several brain regions and this was associated with the presence of abnormal vacuoles and/or giant mitochondria, all of which are symptomatic of degenerative processes (Figs&#160;1A and EV1). Structural alterations of presynaptic terminals in MPS&#8208;IIIA mice proceeded progressively with phenotype worsening and concomitantly with lysosomal enlargement, which is symptomatic of overt lysosomal dysfunction; they were undetectable at 3&#160;months and became significantly evident at 6&#160;months of age (Figs&#160;1A&#8211;C and EV1). Synaptic density was also significantly decreased in 10&#8208;month&#8208;old MPS&#8208;IIIA mice, while any significant reduction in the synapses number was observed at 3 and 6&#160;months (Figs&#160;1A and EV1). Moreover, electrophysiological measurements in acute brain slices of 6&#8208;month&#8208;old MPS&#8208;IIIA mice (when any significant loss of synaptic terminals was detected) revealed that reduction in the synaptic vesicles pool was also associated with severe functional impairments in synaptic activity (Fig&#160;1D). Since the correct function of presynaptic terminals relies on synaptic vesicle recycling processes (Fernandez&#8208;Alfonso &amp; Ryan, 2006), we investigated the efficiency of this process in MPS&#8208;IIIA nerve terminals by analyzing endocytic and exocytic events in individual presynaptic boutons of cultured hippocampal neurons using FM1&#8208;43 dye and pHluorin&#8208;based assays. MPS&#8208;IIIA hippocampal neurons appeared healthy during the first days of culture in&#160;vitro (DIVs). Similar to control wild&#8208;type (WT) cells, DIV10 MPS&#8208;IIIA hippocampal neurons formed dense synaptic interconnections and remained healthy until DIV18&#8211;19, when they began showing axonal swelling before dying at DIV20&#8211;21 (Fig&#160;EV2A). Starting from DIV10, MPS&#8208;IIIA neurons exhibited significantly enlarged lysosomes (Fig&#160;EV2B and C). At this time, EM analysis showed the presence of structure alterations in the presynaptic terminals similar to those found in MPS&#8208;IIIA brain samples (Fig&#160;EV2D). The FM dye uptake was reduced in the synaptic boutons of MPS&#8208;IIIA neurons compared to that observed in control WT cells (Fig&#160;2A). Moreover, we found&#160;that exocytosis rate was also significantly attenuated in MPS&#8208;IIIA presynaptic terminals compared to controls (Fig&#160;2B and Appendix&#160;Fig S1). To test whether these defects may be recapitulated by inducing lysosomal dysfunction in healthy neurons, we blocked lysosomal degradation activity in DIV10 WT hippocampal neurons by treating cells with a cocktail of specific lysosomal inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin A, and E&#8208;64). This treatment led to a severe lysosomal enlargement (Fig&#160;2C) associated with both inefficient endocytic/exocytic events at presynaptic boutons (Fig&#160;2D and E) and decreased number of synaptic vesicles (Fig&#160;2F). Therefore, the establishment of lysosomal dysfunction in neurons negatively affects the recycling of synaptic vesicles at nerve terminals and leads to presynaptic dysfunction. This suggested that defective recycling of synaptic vesicles might play an important role in determining the presynaptic alterations observed in the brain of MPS&#8208;IIIA.</text>

      <text>The recycling of synaptic vesicles is sustained by the function of a specific set of soluble NSF attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins, which include vesicle&#8208;associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2), synaptosomal&#8208;associated protein 25 (SNAP&#8208;25), and syntaxin 1 (Sudhof &amp; Rothman, 2009). Presynaptic SNAREs are continuously used during synaptic activity; therefore, their protein levels need to be strictly maintained at nerve terminals to ensure synaptic recycling and neurotransmitter release. Western blot (WB) analysis in synaptosomal fractions revealed that SNAP&#8208;25 and VAMP2 protein levels were severely reduced in MPS&#8208;IIIA samples compared to control samples, while syntaxin 1 protein levels were unchanged (Fig&#160;3A). The protein level decrease was age dependent reaching ~40% of WT levels in 10&#8208;month&#8208;old MPS&#8208;IIIA mice (Fig&#160;3A). Remarkably, no significant changes in protein levels were found in other presynaptic proteins such as synapsin I, thus indicating that no general emptying processes were occurring at presynaptic terminals (Fig&#160;3A). WB analysis in total brain homogenates showed that VAMP2 and SNAP&#8208;25 proteins were also reduced in whole brain samples, but to a lower extent compared to synaptosomal fractions (Fig&#160;EV3). Confocal analysis in MPS&#8208;IIIA hippocampal neurons showed a sharp decrease in the percentage of synapsin I that co&#8208;localized with either VAMP2 or SNAP&#8208;25, confirming the loss of both VAMP2 and SNAP&#8208;25 proteins at presynapses (Fig&#160;3B). Importantly, mRNA levels of all synaptic SNARE analyzed were similar in MPS&#8208;IIIA and WT brain tissues, demonstrating that there were no changes in the transcription of SNARE genes (Appendix&#160;Fig S2A) and indicating that the age&#8208;dependent reduction in VAMP2 and SNAP&#8208;25 protein levels at nerve terminals is due to disturbed local proteostasis mechanisms. Further supporting this conclusion, we observed that VAMP2 and SNAP&#8208;25 proteins are destabilized and degraded at higher rates in MPS&#8208;IIIA neurons compared to control cells and that their levels are rescued by inhibiting the proteasome system (Fig&#160;3C), which is known to be involved in SNAP&#8208;25 and VAMP2 clearance (Sharma et&#160;al, 2012b). Moreover, consistently with reduced SNARE protein levels, we detected a progressive impairment of SNARE complex assembly in the brain of MPS&#8208;IIIA mice (Fig&#160;3D and E).</text>

      <text>&#945;&#8208;Synuclein and cysteine string protein &#945; (CSP&#945;) are two abundant presynaptic proteins that were identified as key chaperones, which assist SNARE complex formation by ensuring appropriate levels at nerve terminals of VAMP2 and SNAP&#8208;25, respectively (Chandra et&#160;al, 2005; Burre et&#160;al, 2010; Burgoyne &amp; Morgan, 2011; Sharma et&#160;al, 2011). Genetic ablation of CSP&#945; causes defective SNARE complex assembly and fulminant neurodegeneration, while triple &#945;&#946;&#947;&#8208;synuclein null mice exhibit late&#8208;onset decrease in SNARE complex assembly and neurological impairments (Fernandez&#8208;Chacon et&#160;al, 2004; Burre et&#160;al, 2010; Greten&#8208;Harrison et&#160;al, 2010; Sharma et&#160;al, 2012a). Therefore, we asked whether &#945;&#8208;synuclein and CSP&#945; were involved in deficient SNARE complex formation and reduced levels of VAMP2 and SNAP&#8208;25. WB analysis in total homogenates showed an age&#8208;dependent accumulation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein oligomers and a progressive decrease in total CSP&#945; protein in the brain of MPS&#8208;IIIA mice (Fig&#160;3F). Analysis of synaptosomal fractions revealed that CSP&#945; protein levels were reduced in MPS&#8208;IIIA nerve terminals to ~40% of WT levels in 10&#8208;month&#8208;old mice, thus reflecting the decrease in CSP&#945; in whole brain samples (Fig&#160;3G). Unexpectedly, however, we found that &#945;&#8208;synuclein protein levels were also strongly reduced in MPS&#8208;IIIA synaptosomal samples reaching ~30% of WT levels in 10&#8208;month&#8208;old mice (Fig&#160;3G). Therefore, deregulation of SNARE protein levels in MPS&#8208;IIIA brain was associated with a progressive and concomitant loss of &#945;&#8208;synuclein and CSP&#945; at nerve terminals. This loss was consequence of a massive accumulation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein oligomeric forms and overall reduction of CSP&#945; protein levels in the brain.</text>

      <text>At this point, different questions arised: (i) What is the link between &#945;&#8208;synuclein/CSP&#945; changes and lysosomal dysfunction? (ii) Isolated hemizygous reduction in either &#945;&#8208;synuclein or CSP&#945; protein levels does not cause any synaptic phenotype (Chandra et&#160;al, 2004; Fernandez&#8208;Chacon et&#160;al, 2004). We therefore asked whether the concomitant reduction in &#945;&#8208;synuclein and CSP&#945; at nerve terminals was, instead, sufficient to cause presynaptic SNARE defects; (iii) What is the contribution of these events to neurodegenerative processes in LSDs?</text>

      <text>First, we evaluated the effect of restoring normal lysosomal activity in MPS&#8208;IIIA brain on &#945;&#8208;synuclein and CSP&#945; protein levels. We have previously demonstrated that intravenous injection in MPS&#8208;IIIA mice of adeno&#8208;associated virus (AAV) bearing a functional copy of the defective gene (SGSH) engineered to cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier resulted in the correction of the primary lysosomal defect into the brain and, thus, in extensive amelioration of brain pathology (Sorrentino et&#160;al, 2013). Here, we showed that restoring lysosomal activity in treated MPS&#8208;IIIA mice also led to the normalization of &#945;&#8208;synuclein and CSP&#945; protein levels and to increased levels of VAMP2 and SNAP&#8208;25 at presynaptic terminals (Fig&#160;EV4).</text>

      <text>We then investigated the mechanism underlying &#945;&#8208;synuclein and CSP&#945; loss at presynaptic terminals. No differences in &#945;&#8208;synuclein and CSP&#945; mRNA levels were detected between MPS&#8208;IIIA and control WT brain samples (Appendix&#160;Fig S2B), indicating that changes in &#945;&#8208;synuclein and CSP&#945; protein levels observed in brain samples were caused by alterations in post&#8208;translational processes controlling their homeostasis. Lysosomal&#8211;autophagic pathways play a key role in &#945;&#8208;synuclein clearance (Lee et&#160;al, 2004; Mak et&#160;al, 2010). Further expanding previous data (Settembre et&#160;al, 2008; Sorrentino et&#160;al, 2013), we found that lysosomal dysfunction led to a block of autophagic flux from 6&#160;months of age in MPS&#8208;IIIA brain (Fig&#160;4A). Differential detergent extraction revealed that the accumulation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein reflected a drastic increase in insoluble species in whole brain and a consequent decrease in soluble forms in both whole brain and synaptosomal fractions (Fig&#160;4B). These data suggested that imbalance in the lysosomal&#8211;autophagic degradation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein led to a progressive deposition of insoluble forms of the proteins, which depleted the amount of soluble &#945;&#8208;synuclein at nerve terminals. To support this hypothesis, we analyzed protein levels and distribution of &#945;&#8208;synuclein in MPS&#8208;IIIA hippocampal neurons at different DIVs. At early DIVs, WT and MPS&#8208;IIIA cultured neurons exhibited very similar patterns of &#945;&#8208;synuclein immunostaining (Appendix&#160;Fig S3A). Starting at approximately DIV10, &#945;&#8208;synuclein accumulates in MPS&#8208;IIIA neurons almost exclusively as perikarya inclusions, thereby resulting in a sharp decrease in the protein in synaptic puncta (Appendix&#160;Fig S3A and Fig&#160;4C). Consistently, &#945;&#8208;synuclein was found reduced in synapsin I&#8208;positive presynaptic terminals (Appendix&#160;Fig S3B). Similar to the findings in brain samples, MPS&#8208;IIIA hippocampal neurons displayed severely impaired autophagy associated with lysosomal enlargement starting from DIV10 (Figs&#160;EV2B and C, and &#160;EV5A). Confocal analysis in these cells showed that &#945;&#8208;synuclein perikaryal inclusions co&#8208;localized with the lysosomal compartment (Fig&#160;4D). Therefore, as consequence of defective lysosomal&#8211;autophagic degradation, &#945;&#8208;synuclein progressively builds up as insoluble species in the lysosomal compartment of neuronal cell bodies. This accumulation prevents &#945;&#8208;synuclein targeting to nerve terminals likely sequestering soluble &#945;&#8208;synuclein species.</text>

      <text>Differently from &#945;&#8208;synuclein, the presynaptic decrease in the CSP&#945; protein levels reflected the overall reduction in the protein and was not associated with any significant increase in its insoluble forms (Fig&#160;4E). CSP&#945; protein levels in MPS&#8208;IIIA hippocampal neurons exhibited a progressive reduction (detectable from DIV10&#8211;11) associated with an overall loss of CSP&#945;&#8208;positive synaptic puncta, thus supporting the biochemical results in brain samples (Appendix&#160;Fig S3 and Fig&#160;4F). We therefore investigated the possibility that the reduction in CSP&#945; protein levels may be due to its accelerated clearance. We found that the proteasome system is the major pathway involved in CSP&#945; degradation (Fig&#160;EV5B). CSP&#945; degradation rates were then analyzed by blocking protein synthesis and measuring the levels of CSP&#945; with or without proteasome inhibition. This analysis showed that CSP&#945; is destabilized and heavily degraded by the proteasome system in MPS&#8208;IIIA neurons (Fig&#160;4G). The question thus arises on why these processes are accelerated in MPS&#8208;IIIA. Normally, CSP&#945; is extensively palmitoylated at presynaptic terminals where this modification stabilizes the protein preventing its degradation (Greaves et&#160;al, 2008). Analysis of palmitoylation state of CSP&#945; in MPS&#8208;IIIA brain samples at different ages showed that CSP&#945; palmitoylation is severely reduced in MPS&#8208;IIIA brain compared to WT starting from 3&#160;months of age (Fig&#160;4H). Moreover, proteasome pathway was found activated both in MPS&#8208;IIIA brain samples and in hippocampal neurons starting, respectively, from 6&#160;months of age and DIV10, when lysosomal&#8211;autophagic stress also takes place (Figs&#160;4I and J, and EV5C). Importantly, no activation of other proteolytic systems was observed in MPS&#8208;IIIA brain and neurons (Appendix&#160;Fig S4 and Fig&#160;EV5D). These&#160;data suggested that reduced palmitoylation of CSP&#945; increased the susceptibility of the protein to degradation early, but translated in effective enhanced proteasomal clearance only late when the proteasome system became highly activated, likely to compensate for deficient lysosomal degradation activity in MPS&#8208;IIIA.</text>

      <text>Therefore, collectively, our findings indicated that presynaptic loss of &#945;&#8208;synuclein and CSP&#945; is linked to lysosomal dysfunction through mechanisms that involve both the reduced capability of lysosomes to degrade &#945;&#8208;synuclein and the accelerated proteasomal clearance of CSP&#945;.</text>

      <text>To support this conclusion, we analyzed &#945;&#8208;synuclein, CSP&#945;, and the presynaptic SNAREs VAMP2 and SNAP&#8208;25 in WT cultured neurons upon inhibition of lysosomal degradation. As shown before, this treatment led to severe lysosomal enlargement and presynaptic alterations similar to those found in MPS&#8208;IIIA brain (Fig&#160;2C&#8211;F). We found that the treatment also induced a progressive block of autophagic pathway and a concomitant activation of the proteasome system (Fig&#160;5A and B). Moreover, any other proteolytic systems were found activated in treated neurons (Fig&#160;5C). Under these conditions, &#945;&#8208;synuclein was found largely accumulated as high molecular weight forms mostly localized to the perikarya lysosomal compartment of cells (Fig&#160;5D and E). Lysosomal inhibition also resulted in an overall robust decrease in CSP&#945; proteins levels and a consequent reduction in CSP&#945; synaptic puncta (Fig&#160;5D and F). Moreover, presynaptic proteostasis of SNAREs was found strongly altered in treated neurons as shown by loss of VAMP2 and SNAP&#8208;25 at nerve terminals and impairment of SNARE complex formation (Appendix&#160;Fig S5 and Fig&#160;5G). We then evaluated the impact of lysosomal impairment on presynaptic integrity in two other neurodegenerative LSDs, the multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD; caused by the deficiency of sulfatase modifying factor&#8208;1) and the Niemann&#8211;Pick type C&#8208;1 (NPC1; caused by the deficiency of the lysosomal membrane protein NPC1) (Settembre et&#160;al, 2008; Sarkar et&#160;al, 2013). Presynaptic depletion of &#945;&#8208;synuclein and CSP&#945;, defective SNARE proteostasis, and presynaptic structure abnormalities were found associated with lysosomal deficiency also in MSD and NPC1 mouse models (Appendix&#160;Fig S6). Furthermore, no presynaptic abnormalities were observed in a mouse model of MPS type VI (Evers et&#160;al, 1996), a non&#8208;neuropathic LSD due to the inherited deficiency in&#160;the lysosomal hydrolase arylsulfatase&#8208;B that does not show major impairments in neuronal lysosomal degradation pathways (Tessitore et&#160;al, 2009; Appendix&#160;Fig S6). Together, these findings showed that loss of lysosomal function in neurons triggers presynaptic proteostasis defects independently from the specific stress causing lysosomal dysfunction.</text>

      <text>Our data strongly suggest that the simultaneous loss of &#945;&#8208;synuclein and CSP&#945; at nerve terminals destabilizes VAMP2 and SNAP&#8208;25 SNAREs, thus concurrently contributing to inefficient SNARE complex formation. To support this hypothesis, we generated double heterozygous mice with one allele of both CSP&#945; and &#945;&#8208;synuclein depleted (CSP&#945;+/&#8722;/&#945;&#8208;syn+/&#8722;). As expected, double hemizygosity condition in CSP&#945;+/&#8722;/&#945;&#8208;syn+/&#8722; mice reduced both CSP&#945; and &#945;&#8208;synuclein proteins in brain samples to ~50% of WT levels (Fig&#160;6A). SNARE function and structural alterations were then evaluated in the nerve terminals of double heterozygous CSP&#945;+/&#8722;/&#945;&#8208;syn+/&#8722; mice and single both heterozygous and homozygous mice for either CSP&#945; or &#945;&#8208;synuclein KO at 7&#160;weeks of age. Consistent with previous findings (Burre et&#160;al, 2010), SNAP&#8208;25, but not VAMP2, levels were found decreased in synaptosomal fractions derived from homozygous CSP&#945;&#8208;KO mice (Fig&#160;6A). Instead, in homozygous &#945;&#8208;synuclein&#8208;KO mice, SNAP&#8208;25 remains unchanged, whereas VAMP2 levels decreased (Fig&#160;6A). Mice single heterozygous for either CSP&#945; or &#945;&#8208;synuclein deletion&#160;did&#160;not display altered levels of SNARE proteins at presynaptic&#160;terminals (Fig&#160;6A). In contrast, age&#8208;matched double heterozygous CSP&#945;+/&#8722;/&#945;&#8208;syn+/&#8722; mice exhibited ~30% reduction in the presynaptic levels of both SNAP&#8208;25 and VAMP2 proteins (Fig&#160;6A). The extent&#160;of such decrease was sufficient to cause inhibition of SNARE&#160;complex formation, reduction in the number of synaptic vesicles, and most importantly, impaired synaptic activity.

      <text>On the basis of our data, we reasoned that re&#8208;establishing the levels of either CSP&#945; or &#945;&#8208;synuclein at presynaptic terminals in LSD mice would be sufficient to slow down SNARE&#8208;dependent degenerative processes by increasing SNARE protein levels, thus allowing us to evaluate the effective contribution of &#945;&#8208;synuclein&#8208; and CSP&#945;&#8208;dependent SNARE defects to LSD neurodegeneration. To address this hypothesis, we overexpressed CSP&#945; in MPS&#8208;IIIA mouse brain in&#160;vivo using adeno&#8208;associated viral (AAV) vectors. Transgenic overexpression of &#945;&#8208;synuclein may compensate for CSP&#945; deficiency in KO mice (Chandra et&#160;al, 2005). However, we chose to overexpress CSP&#945; rather than &#945;&#8208;synuclein because we assumed that in our disease model, &#945;&#8208;synuclein overexpression could result in a more severe phenotype due to its propensity to aggregate. Newborn MPS&#8208;IIIA mice received a single intracerebroventricular injection of AAV serotype 9 encoding a myc&#8208;tagged CSP&#945; under the control of a synapsin I promoter. IF analysis revealed a synaptic punctuate transduction pattern in which several brain areas exhibited high levels of myc&#8208;tagged CSP&#945; protein that co&#8208;localized with the presynaptic compartment (Fig&#160;7A). Consistently, WB analysis 10&#160;months after injection showed increased CSP&#945; protein levels in synaptosomal fractions of CSP&#945;&#8208;injected MPS&#8208;IIIA mice compared with controls (Fig&#160;7B). CSP&#945; overexpression rescued SNAP&#8208;25 physiological levels and also led to a significant increment in VAMP2 levels (Fig&#160;7C). Increased SNARE protein levels were sufficient to restore efficient formation of SNARE complexes at synapses (Fig&#160;7D and E). EM analysis 10&#160;months after injection showed that CSP&#945; overexpression was able to attenuate the loss of synapses observed in affected age&#8208;matched MPS&#8208;IIIA mice (Fig&#160;8A). At this age, presynaptic terminals of CSP&#945;&#8208;treated MPS&#8208;IIIA mice also displayed an overall significant increase in the number of synaptic vesicles compared with control MPS&#8208;IIIA mice, even if some abnormal structures and vacuoles were still observed in the synapses of injected animals, indicating that degenerative processes at nerve terminals were not fully prevented (Fig&#160;8A). Synaptic strength was also recovered, as shown by fESPS measurements in acute hippocampal slices (Fig&#160;8B).</text>

      <text>Finally, we evaluated the impact of CSP&#945; overexpression on neuropathology and survival. Seven&#8208;month&#8208;old MPS&#8208;IIIA mice displayed a sex&#8208;dependent reduced neuromotor performance in the open field exploratory test, in the elevated plus maze, and in the wire hanging test (Fig&#160;8C). CSP&#945; injection in MPS&#8208;IIIA mice resulted in an overall improvement of all neurobehavioral activities with a significant rescue observed in most of the parameters tested (Fig&#160;8C). Moreover, examination of neuronal density in different brain regions of CSP&#945;&#8208;injected MPS&#8208;IIIA mice revealed that treatment also attenuated the loss of neuronal cells in affected mice (Fig&#160;8D). We then evaluated the survival rates in MPS&#8208;IIIA mice upon CSP&#945; treatment. The Kaplan&#8211;Meier survival curve showed that at 20&#160;months of age, 92.3% of control WT mice survived, while only 7.7% of affected MPS&#8208;IIIA survived at same age, P&#160;=&#160;0.00003 (Fig&#160;8E). MPS&#8208;IIIA mice receiving CSP&#945; injection lived significantly longer than untreated MPS&#8208;IIIA mice (69.2% vs. 7.7% survived mice at 20&#160;months; P&#160;=&#160;0.000776; Fig&#160;8E).</text>

      <text>Our study sheds new light on the mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration in lysosomal diseases. We found that lysosomal dysfunction exerts a disruptive action on presynaptic integrity and that the loss of SNARE function mediated by the concomitant deficiency of &#945;&#8208;synuclein and CSP&#945; at presynaptic terminals is a critical mechanism triggering this action.</text>

      <offset>55086</offset>
      <text>Mechanistically, &#945;&#8208;synuclein presynaptic deficiency is caused by impaired lysosomal&#8211;autophagic degradation, which leads to &#945;&#8208;synuclein sequestration in large insoluble forms localized to neuronal bodies. &#945;&#8208;Synuclein aggregation in Lewy bodies is a hallmark of neurodegeneration in synucleinopathies (Spillantini et&#160;al, 1997; Roy, 2009). Therefore, the relative loss of &#945;&#8208;synuclein function by its abnormal sequestration in Lewy bodies may contribute to drive neuronal degeneration in synucleinopathies. Recently, CSP&#945; mutations have been found associated with lysosomal dysfunction in a late&#8208;onset form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, a severe neurodegenerative LSD (Noskova et&#160;al, 2011). Our data show that in neurons with lysosomal impairment, the protein levels of CSP&#945; are overall decreased due to its increased destabilization and proteasomal degradation. We also found that in these neurons, CSP&#945; palmitoylation, a modification known to affect the stability of the protein, is reduced. Such alteration appeared at 3&#160;months of age in MPS&#8208;IIIA mice, that is, at time when lysosomal dysfunction in terms of autophagic stress is still absent. One hypothesis is that already at this time lysosomal deficiency may affect CSP&#945; palmitoylation. Indeed, (i) together with the primary genetic deficiency of a specific enzyme, the activity of other lysosomal hydrolases can change as an early event as a consequence of secondary inhibitory mechanisms in LSDs (Platt et&#160;al, 2012) and (ii) lysosomal enzymatic activity was found to be involved in palmitoylation dynamics (Prescott et&#160;al, 2009). As a consequence of lysosomal dysfunction, we also found that the proteasome system is activated, likely to compensate for defective cellular degradation capacity. Therefore, our data strongly suggest a model in which lysosomal dysfunction accelerates CSP&#945; degradation by acting at two levels; first, it reduces the palmitoylation state of CSP&#945; making the protein more prone to be degraded, and then, it hyper&#8208;activates the proteasome system, likely as compensatory mechanisms, thus resulting in a high rate of CSP&#945; degradation.</text>

      <text>Isolated &#945;&#8208;synuclein depletion does not lead to neurodegeneration (Chandra et&#160;al, 2004). Moreover, neither CSP&#945; nor SNAP&#8208;25 hemizygosity is sufficient to cause major synaptic dysfunction as opposed to a complete loss of either CSP&#945; or SNAP&#8208;25 in KO mice (Washbourne et&#160;al, 2002; Fernandez&#8208;Chacon et&#160;al, 2004; Sharma et&#160;al, 2012a). By analyzing double heterozygous CSP&#945;+/&#8722;/&#945;&#8208;syn+/&#8722; mice, here we found that the concomitant reduction of CSP&#945; and &#945;&#8208;synuclein to ~50% of WT levels synergically contributes to the loss of SNARE function at nerve terminals and is therefore deleterious for presynaptic integrity. This is an important new finding that adds more insight into the disease relevance of &#945;&#8208;synuclein and CSP&#945; deficiencies. Very importantly, we also demonstrated that CSP&#945; overexpression prolonged survival and exerted a protective action against neurodegeneration in MPS&#8208;IIIA mice by re&#8208;establishing efficient SNARE complex formation and improving presynaptic function. Furthermore, similar to CSP&#945; overexpression, SNAP&#8208;25 overexpression was also able to rescue presynaptic function in MPS&#8208;IIIA neurons. Together, these data strongly argue that &#945;&#8208;synuclein&#8208;/CSP&#945;&#8208;mediated SNARE defect is a critical pathway mediating presynaptic and neuronal degenerative processes in LSDs. As expected, however, restoring SNARE function via CSP&#945; overexpression was not sufficient to fully prevent the neurodegenerative phenotype in MPS&#8208;IIIA mice since other mechanisms activated by lysosomal dysfunction continue to operate in driving neurodegenerative processes. Nevertheless, our findings provide a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle demonstrating the therapeutic effectiveness of targeting SNARE chaperone&#8208;mediated synaptic maintenance. Moreover, the possibility of acting on the endogenous players of this pathway by drug repositioning/discovery may implement and greatly improve the effectiveness of existing protocols, which, to date, have shown a substantial inefficacy in the treatment for brain pathology in LSDs. Importantly, such possibility may have an immediate impact in the clinical management of LSD patients.</text>

      <text>In conclusion, our study uncovers an unknown link between lysosomal dysfunction and presynaptic maintenance that is mediated by a concurrent loss of &#945;&#8208;synuclein and CSP&#945; at nerve terminals. Our findings also demonstrate that the deregulation of this pathway is relevant for the neuropathogenesis of LSDs and that the re&#8208;establishment of its integrity may be exploited for the therapy of LSDs.</text>

After 48&#160;h, cells were harvested and analyzed by immunofluorescence. This vector is designed to express ZsGreen fused to the mouse ornithine decarboxylase degradation domain (MODC d410). When the proteasome is highly active in living cells, the protein will not accumulate; otherwise, the fusion protein will accumulate in cells and thus results in an increase in the number of green fluorescent spots under 488&#8208;nm laser beam. The average fluorescence of GFP&#8208;positive structures (F) was measured by ImageJ software on 8 bit threshold images using analyze particle plugin. Proteasome activity was inversely correlated with F (1/F).</text>

      <text>The imaging procedures that we used have been previously described (Gaffield &amp; Betz, 2006). Briefly, presynaptic terminals were labeled by exposure to styryl dye (8&#160;&#956;M FM1&#8208;43) during high&#8208;K+ depolarization (modified Tyrode, 55&#160;mM KCl). Dye was left in the extracellular solution for 1&#160;min to let the nerve terminal recover in the presence of the dye and allow for complete endocytosis of all released vesicles. Then, we washed away the extracellular FM dye by switching out solution multiple times with fresh saline solution. All staining and washing protocols were performed with modified Tyrode containing 10&#160;&#956;M CNQX to prevent recurrent activity. Images were taken after 10&#8208; to 15&#8208;min washes in dye&#8208;free solution. The amount of fluorescence in each terminal was quantified using ImageJ analysis software. We analyzed 300 boutons from both WT and MPS&#8208;IIIA neurons. Upon fluorescence quantification, data were either plotted as distribution (fraction of boutons showing similar intensity) or displayed as mean&#160;&#177;&#160;s.e.m.</text>

      <text>To image vesicle release, synaptic vesicle exocytosis was stimulated with the depolarizing solution (modified Tyrode, 55&#160;mM KCl) during the imaging process. As vesicles exocytosed, dye was released into extracellular space and was quickly washed away. The amount of fluorescence in each synaptic bouton was quantified for each time point using ImageJ analysis software. Loss in fluorescence measured during stimulation (expressed as percentage of fluorescence intensity at the time of stimulation; T30: 100% fluorescence) indicates the rate of synaptic vesicle exocytosis.</text>

For field stimulation, KCl 50&#160;mM perfusion was applied for 60&#160;s using a peristaltic Pump model 720 (OkoLab, Naples, Italy). The fluorescence change of the probe was monitored during time upon KCl perfusion (exocytosis of recycling pool) followed by NH4Cl perfusion (exocytosis of total vesicle pool). Images were acquired with 100&#8208;ms autoexposures at 3&#8208;s intervals for three minutes. ROIs were placed on each bouton and average intensities were obtained for each frame within the time lapse. F max was defined as the average fluorescence of the maximal five frames after NH4Cl perfusion. Baseline F 0 was defined as the average fluorescence of the initial 10 frames before stimulation [(F 0&#160;=&#160;average (F 1:F 10)]. Fluorescence intensity of a bouton at a given time point (F) was normalized to F 0 and F max and expressed as (F&#160;&#8722;&#160;F 0)/(F max&#160;&#8722;&#160;F 0).</text>

      <text>Exploratory behavior was tested in the open field task (one single batch), anxiety was tested in the elevated plus maze, and neuromuscular function was tested in the wire hanging. These are the three tasks where MPS&#8208;IIIA mice have been reported to show impairment, although with sex differences. Female and male mice were housed in Plexiglas cages (18&#160;&#215;&#160;35&#160;&#215;&#160;12&#160;cm) with free access to food and water and kept at a temperature range between 20 and 23&#176;C. These tests were carried out in a behavioral testing room maintained under constant light, temperature, and humidity. The mice were tested during daylight hours (between 9&#160;AM and 6&#160;PM). Before testing, animals were habituated to the testing room for at least 30&#160;min. All behavioral tests were performed by the same experimenter (MDR) blinded to genotype. During the open field task, the MPSIIIA mice were placed in the middle of a Plexiglas arena with a masonite base (43&#160;&#215;&#160;32&#160;&#215;&#160;40&#160;cm) placed on a flat surface 70&#160;cm over the floor. Animals were left free to explore the device for 10&#160;min. The distance travelled (m), maximum speed (m/s), central area line crossing, and immobility time (s) were recorded for 10&#160;min using a video camera (PANASONIC WV&#8208;BP330) hanging over the arena that was connected to a video&#8208;tracking system (ANY&#8208;MAZE, Stoelting, USA). The data were analyzed considering two 5&#8208;min time intervals, with two&#8208;way ANOVA for repeated measures, with the factors groups (3 levels) and time intervals (2 levels) as between groups and repeated measures, respectively. In the elevated plus maze, mice were placed individually onto the center of the maze and videotracked for a 5&#8208;min period. The measures taken were distance travelled (m) and percentage entries in open arms (open arms entries/total arm entries). The wire hanging was performed about 2&#160;h after the elevated plus maze. The animal was placed on a wire 50&#160;cm above a sawdust&#8208;covered cage, gently shaken to favor animals grasping. The wire was turned upside down, and the latency to fall down from the wire was measured using a 120&#8208;s cut&#8208;off time testing.</text>

      <text>Data are expressed as mean&#160;&#177;&#160;s.e.m. Student's t&#8208;test was used to compare different samples in biochemical and EM analyses. Mann&#8211;Whitney U&#8208;test and Kruskal&#8211;Wallis ANOVA followed by Dunn's test were used for electrophysiology. Duncan post hoc test was used for behavioral data. The Kaplan&#8211;Meier survival curve was analyzed with the chi&#8208;squared test. A P&#8208;value of &lt;&#160;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The investigator was blinded when assessing the outcome during data analysis.</text>

      <text>Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are inherited diseases characterized by lysosomal dysfunction and often showing a neurodegenerative course. There is no cure to treat the central nervous system in LSDs. Moreover, the mechanisms driving neuronal degeneration in these pathological conditions remain largely unknown.</text>

      <text>We identified a disease&#8208;relevant link between lysosomal dysfunction and presynaptic maintenance. &#945;&#8208;Synuclein and cysteine string protein (CSP)&#945; chaperones cooperate in sustaining synaptic terminal function by maintaining SNARE protein levels and assisting synaptic vesicle recycling at presynaptic terminals. By studying mouse models of LSDs, we found that impaired lysosomal activity caused the simultaneous loss of &#945;&#8208;synuclein and CSP&#945; at nerve terminals, thus leading to SNARE&#8208;altered proteostasis, synaptic recycling defects, and profound presynaptic alterations. We also showed that restoring appropriate levels of CSP&#945; at nerve terminal by viral&#8208;mediated overexpression in the brain of a mouse model of mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (a severe form of neurodegenerative LSDs) re&#8208;established SNARE complex assembly, thereby ameliorating presynaptic function and protecting against neurodegenerative signs.</text>
