      <text>Autophagy is a cellular process that degrades subcellular constituents, and is conserved from yeast to mammals. Although autophagy is believed to be essential for living cells, cells lacking Atg5 or Atg7 are healthy, suggesting that a non&#8208;canonical degradation pathway exists to compensate for the lack of autophagy. In this study, we show that the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which lacks Atg5, undergoes bulk protein degradation using Golgi&#8208;mediated structures to compensate for autophagy when treated with amphotericin B1, a polyene antifungal drug. We named this mechanism Golgi membrane&#8208;associated degradation (GOMED) pathway. This process is driven by the disruption of PI(4)P&#8208;dependent anterograde trafficking from the Golgi, and it also exists in Atg5&#8208;deficient mammalian cells. Biologically, when an Atg5&#8208;deficient &#946;&#8208;cell line and Atg7&#8208;deficient &#946;&#8208;cells were cultured in glucose&#8208;deprived medium, a disruption in the secretion of insulin granules from the Golgi occurred, and GOMED was induced to digest these (pro)insulin granules. In conclusion, GOMED is activated by the disruption of PI(4)P&#8208;dependent anterograde trafficking in autophagy&#8208;deficient yeast and mammalian cells.</text>

      <text>The intracellular degradation of protein serves a number of functions, including the regulation of protein expression levels and the removal of damaged proteins. Protein degradation is achieved by two mechanisms: the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagy&#8211;lysosome pathway. It is generally known that UPS degrades individual ubiquitinated proteins in a regulated manner. In contrast, the autophagy&#8211;lysosome pathway is utilized for bulk degradation, although recent studies demonstrated cases in which specific cargos are degraded, namely selective autophagy. The degradation of a large number of proteins and even entire organelles at once is only capable by the autophagy&#8211;lysosome pathway, and hence, this process is essential for living cells (Xie &amp; Klionsky, 2007; Mizushima et&#160;al, 2008, 2011).</text>

      <text>The autophagy&#8211;lysosome pathway includes two phylogenetically conserved pathways: macroautophagy and microautophagy. Macroautophagy is characterized by the formation of specific double&#8208;membrane autophagosomes that sequester cargo material. Autophagosomes fuse with lytic organelles (vacuoles in yeast and lysosomes in mammals) and degrade cargo material (Nakatogawa et&#160;al, 2009). In microautophagy, cargos are directly incorporated into vacuoles (or lysosomes) via the invagination of their membrane (M&#252;ller et&#160;al, 2000). In addition to these two types of autophagy, mammalian cells have a third autophagy&#8211;lysosome pathway, namely chaperone&#8208;mediated autophagy, in which cytosolic proteins that are specifically selected by the chaperones are degraded in lysosomes (Arias &amp; Cuervo, 2011). Among these autophagy&#8211;lysosome pathways, macroautophagy is believed to be the most efficient bulk degradation pathway.</text>

      <text>The molecular mechanisms of macroautophagy (hereafter described as &#8220;autophagy&#8221; unless otherwise mentioned) has been studied in yeast and mice, and is currently considered to be driven by more than 30 autophagy&#8208;related proteins (Atgs) that are well conserved from yeast to mammals (Mizushima et&#160;al, 2011). Among them, Atg5 and Atg7 are recognized as the molecules most crucial for autophagy, and the lipidation of Atg8 (in yeast) and microtubule&#8208;associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) (in mammals) is believed to be the most accurate marker of autophagy induction (Mizushima et&#160;al, 2011). A large amount of evidence indicates that Atg5&#8208;dependent autophagy plays crucial roles in various physiological events in yeast and mammals, and hence, this process is considered to be indispensable for most organisms.</text>

      <text>Nonetheless, yeast and mammalian cells lacking Atg5 or Atg7 remain healthy. Furthermore, even embryos lacking Atg5 or Atg7 do not have any abnormalities (Kuma et&#160;al, 2004; Komatsu et&#160;al, 2005). Therefore, we considered the possible existence of another bulk degradation pathway that compensate for the lack of Atg5/Atg7&#8208;dependent autophagy. In mammals, we previously discovered a mechanism we named &#8220;the alternative autophagy&#8221; as such a pathway (Nishida et&#160;al, 2009). The role of alternative autophagy is similar to Atg5/Atg7&#8208;dependent autophagy, whereby cellular components and organelles are digested within autolysosomes. But the signaling pathway involves Unc&#8208;51&#8208;like kinase 1 (Ulk1), Beclin1, or Rab9, and not Atg5, Atg7, or LC3.</text>

      <text>In this study, we aimed to identify and characterize a novel bulk degradation pathway that compensates for Atg5/Atg7&#8208;dependent autophagy in yeast cells. We also examined the phylogenetic conservation of this pathway in mammals. Our results indicated that a novel degradation pathway is activated when Golgi&#8208;to&#8208;plasma membrane (PM) trafficking is disturbed in atg5&#916; and atg7&#916; yeast cells, in which Golgi membranes are stacked, elongated, curved, and generate double&#8208;membrane compartments enclosing the cytoplasm and various organelles. These compartments are then fused with vacuoles to degrade cargo molecules. This degradation pathway also functions in Atg5&#8208;deficient mammalian cells when Golgi&#8208;to&#8208;PM trafficking is disrupted. In Atg5&#8208;deficient &#946;&#8208;cell line and Atg7&#8208;deficient &#946;&#8208;cells, this pathway functions to suppress insulin secretion by degrading unused insulin granules, when there is a reduction in the glucose concentration of the culture medium (similar situation to the failure of Golgi&#8208;to&#8208;PM trafficking). Taken together, we here identified and characterized a novel degradation pathway that is generated from the Golgi membrane. We named this pathway the Golgi membrane&#8208;associated degradation (GOMED). This pathway is activated when Golgi&#8208;to&#8208;PM trafficking is disrupted.</text>

      <offset>6025</offset>
      <text>To study the Atg5&#8208;independent bulk degradation pathway in yeast, an alkaline phosphatase protein lacking the N&#8208;terminal transmembrane domain (pho8&#916;60) fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP; GFP&#8208;pho8&#916;60) was expressed in atg5&#916; yeast cells. Pho8&#916;60 is known to localize in the cytosol and to be delivered to vacuoles, primarily through autophagy (Noda et&#160;al, 1995). Once GFP&#8208;pho8&#916;60 is transported to the vacuoles, GFP is released from the fusion protein by Pep4, a vacuolar protease (Epple et&#160;al, 2001). We observed this cleavage when wild&#8208;type (WT) yeast cells, but not atg5&#916; cells, were starved (Fig&#160;1A), indicating that GFP&#8208;pho8&#916;60 processing is a good marker of autophagy and that no compensatory pathway exists for starvation&#8208;induced autophagy. We then treated GFP&#8208;pho8&#916;60&#8208;transfected atg5&#916; cells with various stress&#8208;inducing drugs to search for stimuli that lead to the degradation of GFP&#8208;pho8&#916;60 (Appendix&#160;Fig S1). Among these drugs, amphotericin B1 (AmphoB) treatment resulted in the efficient processing of GFP&#8208;pho8&#916;60 in a time&#8208; and concentration&#8208;dependent manner (Fig&#160;1B and C). Consistent results were obtained when atg7&#916; cells were treated with AmphoB (Fig&#160;1D). The processing of GFP&#8208;pho8&#916;60 was concluded to occur in vacuoles in a Pep4&#8208;dependent manner, as this processing was suppressed in cells lacking Pep4 (Fig&#160;1E) and as following AmphoB treatment, some GFP&#8208;pho8&#916;60 was delivered from the cytosol to the vacuoles where Pep4 is localized (Fig&#160;1F). Similarly to GFP&#8208;pho8&#916;60, the Adh1&#8208;monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP), another cytosolic protein, was also delivered to vacuoles following AmphoB treatment (Appendix&#160;Fig S2). Interestingly, several organelle&#8208;specific GFP fusion proteins were also processed following AmphoB treatment (Appendix&#160;Fig S3). We observed several bands other than GFP in some AmphoB&#8208;treated cells. This might be due to a delay in the maturation process of pep4 (Appendix&#160;Fig S4A). All of these findings indicated that Atg5&#8208;independent bulk degradation occurred within vacuoles after AmphoB treatment.</text>

      <text>Because GFP&#8208;pho8&#916;60 processing was found to occur in vacuoles, we next examined the morphology of the vacuoles in AmphoB&#8208;treated yeast cells using phase&#8208;contrast microscopy. Given that the absence of Pep4 enables the preservation of structures within vacuoles (Epple et&#160;al, 2001), we used atg5&#916;pep4&#916; cells. Under conditions of vegetative growth and starvation, no visible structures were observed within the vacuoles of atg5&#916;pep4&#916; cells, whereas several spherical bodies were found to have accumulated in the vacuoles after AmphoB treatment (Fig&#160;1G and H, and Movies EV1, EV2, EV3, EV4, EV5 and EV6). These structures moved actively by Brownian motion, similar to autophagic bodies (ABs) (Kirisako et&#160;al, 1999) (Fig&#160;1G and H, and Movies EV1, EV2, EV3, EV4, EV5 and EV6). Consistently, we observed AB&#8208;like structures enclosing lipid particles, ribosomes, mitochondria, and various other organelles within a single&#8208;membrane structure (300&#8211;900&#160;nm in size) in the vacuolar lumen of cells exposed to AmphoB, on quick&#8208;frozen replicas and thin sections of the frozen&#8208;substituted material (Fig&#160;1I and J, and Appendix&#160;Fig S4B). The proportion of cells containing AB&#8208;like structures was greater than 70% at 24&#160;h after AmphoB treatment (Fig&#160;1K). Detailed analysis demonstrated that the membranes of AB&#8208;like structures contained a few intramembrane particles on both the protoplasmic (P&#8208;face) and exoplasmic (E&#8208;face) half&#8208;membranes (Fig&#160;EV1A), which is completely different from the property of vacuolar membranes as they contain many intramembrane particles (Fig&#160;EV1B). This suggests that the AB&#8208;like structures did not arise from the vacuolar membranes (microautophagy), but originated outside of the vacuoles. Furthermore, when we deleted Vtc4, a molecule crucial for microautophagy (Uttenweiler et&#160;al, 2007), from atg5&#916;pep4&#916; cells and then treated the cells with AmphoB, microautophagic structures were completely absent (Fig&#160;EV1C) but AB&#8208;like structures were not affected (Fig&#160;EV1D). GFP&#8208;pho8&#916;60 processing also occurred in AmphoB&#8208;treated vtc4&#916;atg5&#916; cells (Fig&#160;EV1E). Taken together, AmphoB treatment results in a novel Atg5&#8208;independent bulk degradation pathway accompanied by the formation of AB&#8208;like structures.</text>

      <text>Ultrastructural analysis of AmphoB&#8208;treated atg5&#916;pep4&#916; cells exhibited another characteristic feature, namely dramatic morphological changes of the Golgi apparatus. It is widely known that Golgi cisternae are not stacked in S.&#160;cerevisiae but occur as a single, small layer scattered throughout the cytoplasm (Rossanese et&#160;al, 1999). However, AmphoB treatment induced the elongation of Golgi cisternae and the formation of Golgi stacks, as in animal and plant cells (Fig&#160;2A&#8211;D). Correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) showed stacked membranes which merged with Sec7&#8208;GFP signals (a trans&#8208;Golgi marker; Fig&#160;EV1F, arrows). Many single membranes were observed surrounding the stacked membranes, which were merged with the mRFP&#8208;Sed5 signals (a cis&#8208;Golgi marker; Fig&#160;EV1F, arrowheads). Therefore, these stacked membranes were concluded to have originated from Golgi membranes. Interestingly, we further observed that the distal Golgi cisternae were curved and formed spherical bodies containing cytoplasmic component and organelles (Fig&#160;2E and F). The spherical bodies were double&#8208;membrane compartments, similar to autophagosomes (AP) (Fig&#160;EV1G).</text>

      <text>Importantly, several of our experimental results indicated that the Golgi&#8208;derived spherical bodies are the source of AB&#8208;like structures in the vacuoles. Firstly, we observed images of the spherical body separating away from Golgi stacks (Fig&#160;2G) as well as the outer membrane of the spherical body fusing with the vacuolar membrane (Fig&#160;2H and I). The inner membrane compartment appeared to be incorporated into the vacuoles to become AB&#8208;like structures (Fig&#160;2H and I). Second, quantitative EM analysis demonstrated that many elongated and stacked Golgi structures and a few AB&#8208;like structures were present in the atg5&#916;pep4&#916; cells during the initial 6&#8211;12&#160;h of AmphoB treatment, but the situation was reversed at 24&#160;h (Fig&#160;2J). Third, GFP&#8208;fused Sft2, another trans&#8208;Golgi marker, exhibited a dot&#8208;like pattern in the cytoplasm without AmphoB treatment, whereas it was translocated to the vacuolar membranes (probably derived from the outer membranes of spherical bodies) (Fig&#160;2K &#8220;AmphoB&#8221;: right cell) and inside of the vacuoles (probably derived from the inner membrane) (Fig&#160;2K &#8220;AmphoB&#8221;: left cell). Consistent results were obtained from the analysis of Sec7&#8208;GFP (Appendix&#160;Fig S5A), but not Om45&#8208;GFP and Sec71&#8208;GFP, a mitochondria and an ER marker, respectively (Appendix&#160;Fig S5B and C). Fourth, biochemical fractionation showed that the trans&#8208;Golgi marker was translocated to the vacuolar membrane by AmphoB treatment (Appendix&#160;Fig S5D). Fifth, lack of the Golgi membrane proteins Grh1 and Gvp36 blocked the generation of spherical bodies and AB&#8208;like structures as assessed by EM (Fig&#160;2L and M) and phase&#8208;contrast microscopy (Fig&#160;2N). AmphoB&#8208;induced GFP&#8208;pho8&#916;60 processing was also inhibited in grh1&#916;atg5&#916; and gvp36&#916;atg5&#916; cells (Fig&#160;2O). Taken together, these data indicate that Golgi membranes were required for Atg5&#8208;independent bulk degradation and for the generation of AB&#8208;like structures after AmphoB treatment. Therefore, we named this novel degradation pathway the Golgi membrane&#8208;associated degradation (GOMED) pathway.</text>

      <text>The morphological features of GOMED were quite similar to autophagy. Furthermore, the deletion of Atg1 (yeast homolog of Ulk1) suppressed GOMED, as assessed by GFP&#8208;pho8&#916;60 processing and EM analyses (Appendix&#160;Fig S6A&#8211;C). However, we did not observe any involvement of other autophagy genes (Appendix&#160;Fig S6D&#8211;I). Furthermore, we cannot deny the possibility that this proteolysis is performed simply by the consequence of Golgi membrane deformity. Therefore, we did not consider GOMED to be a type of autophagy in this study.</text>

      <text>The unique morphology of the Golgi membranes during GOMED led us to hypothesize that molecules that regulate Golgi function may be involved in GOMED. Given that AmphoB directly perturbs ergosterol (Mouri et&#160;al, 2008) and that the amount of ergosterol in the ER regulates phosphatidylinositol 4&#8208;phosphate [PI(4)P] levels on the Golgi membrane (Beh &amp; Rine, 2004), AmphoB may reduce Golgi PI(4)P levels and thereby induce GOMED. To test this hypothesis, we first examined PI(4)P localization (Roy &amp; Levine, 2004) using the PI(4)P reporter GFP&#8208;2xPHOsh2. PI(4)P localized to the Golgi and PM in healthy atg5&#916; cells (Fig&#160;3A, &#8220;atg5&#916; 37&#176;C&#8221;), as described previously (Stefan et&#160;al, 2011). Golgi localization of PI(4)P was confirmed by the overlap of its signals with those of Golgi markers (Fig&#160;EV2A). After AmphoB treatment, the GFP&#8208;2xPHOsh2 signals were spread throughout the cytosol and had disappeared from the Golgi (Fig&#160;3A &#8220;atg5&#916; AmphoB&#8221;). Similar results were observed when Golgi PI(4)P levels were monitored using the Golgi&#8208;specific PI(4)P reporter GFP&#8208;GOLPH3 (Mousley et&#160;al, 2012) (Fig&#160;3B), suggesting that AmphoB treatment, as expected, reduced Golgi PI(4)P levels.</text>

      <text>We next investigated whether a reduction in Golgi PI(4)P levels is required for AmphoB&#8208;induced GOMED. To this end, we increased Golgi PI(4)P levels by genetically engineering Sac1, a PI(4)&#8208;phosphatase localized to the Golgi and the ER. As expected, when analyzing sac1&#8208;23/atg5&#916; cells (Foti et&#160;al, 2001), a temperature&#8208;sensitive mutant that loses PI(4)&#8208;phosphatase activity at 37&#176;C, we observed Golgi&#8208;localized PI(4)P signals even after AmphoB treatment (Fig&#160;3A and B &#8220;sac1&#8208;23 atg5&#916; AmphoB&#8221;). Importantly, in these cells, AmphoB&#8208;induced GOMED was markedly inhibited, as assessed by GFP&#8208;pho8&#916;60 processing (Fig&#160;3C), EM observations (Figs&#160;3D and EV2B and C), and phase&#8208;contrast microscopy (Fig&#160;EV2D). Although the suppression of GOMED was partial, this was due to the presence of other Golgi PI(4)&#8208;phosphatases, namely Inp52 and Inp53 (Guo et&#160;al, 1999). In fact, when we deleted Inp52 and Inp53 from atg5&#916; cells, we also observed marked suppression of AmphoB&#8208;induced GOMED (Fig&#160;EV2E and F). These results indicated that a reduction in Golgi PI(4)P levels is crucial for the induction of GOMED.</text>

      <text>We then investigated whether a direct reduction in Golgi PI(4)P levels is sufficient to induce GOMED. pik1&#8208;83 is a temperature&#8208;sensitive mutant that loses its PI(4)&#8208;kinase activity in the Golgi at or above 37&#176;C (Audhya et&#160;al, 2000). Localization analysis confirmed the loss of PI(4)P at the Golgi in pik1&#8208;83/atg5&#916; cells at 37&#176;C (Fig&#160;3A and B &#8220;pik1&#8208;83 atg5&#916;&#8221;). In pik1&#8208;83/atg5&#916;pep4&#916; cells, AB&#8208;like structures were induced after changes in temperature as judged from phase&#8208;contrast microscopy (Fig&#160;3E) and EM observations (Fig&#160;3F and G). Importantly, freeze replica immunolabeling demonstrated the presence of HA&#8208;tagged Sec7 (a trans&#8208;Golgi marker) on the membrane of AP&#8208;like (Fig&#160;3H) and AB&#8208;like structures (Fig&#160;EV2G), indicating the Golgi&#8208;mediated generation of GOMED. Note that Golgi membranes were also immunolabeled by Sec7&#8208;HA (Fig&#160;3H). These data indicated that a direct reduction in Golgi PI(4)P levels is sufficient to induce GOMED.</text>

      <text>Golgi PI(4)P regulates several Golgi functions (Mayinger, 2012). Therefore, an important question is which of these functions is needed for GOMED. Defects in lipid sorting induced by Osh1 or Osh4 deletion and defects in retrograde trafficking induced by Vps74 deletion did not activate GOMED (Appendix&#160;Fig S7A). In contrast, the temperature&#8208;sensitive deletion of Gga1 and Gga2, proteins responsible for anterograde trafficking in conjunction with PI(4)P (Demmel et&#160;al, 2008), induced GOMED (Fig&#160;3I and J, and Appendix&#160;Fig S7A), recapitulating the loss of PI(4) kinase. To further identify the type of anterograde trafficking machinery required for GOMED, we generated atg5&#916; cells lacking each of the components of the membrane trafficking machinery. As a result, we observed GOMED in ypt31&#916;ypt32A141D/atg5&#916;pep4&#916; cells (Ortiz et&#160;al, 2002) (Appendix&#160;Fig S7B), which lack the components for protein export from the Golgi to the PM, whereas other trafficking mutants (Kaiser &amp; Schekman, 1990; Becherer et&#160;al, 1996; Luo &amp; Gallwitz, 2003) (sec23&#8208;1; ER to Golgi, pep12&#916;; Golgi to vacuole, ypt6&#916;; endosome to Golgi) and endocytosis mutants (Singer&#8208;Kr&#252;ger et&#160;al, 1994; Smaczynska&#8208;de Rooij et&#160;al, 2010) (vps1&#916; and ypt51&#916;ypt52&#916;ypt53&#916;) did not induce GOMED (Appendix&#160;Fig S7B). Pharmacologically, the addition of 1, 3&#8208;cyclohexanebis(methylamine) (CBM), a compound that interferes with coatomer binding to Golgi membranes and thereby inhibits anterograde trafficking (Hu et&#160;al, 1999), also induced GOMED in atg5&#916;pep4&#916; cells (Fig&#160;3K and L). The failure of trafficking from the Golgi to the PM can be identified by the accumulation of O&#8208;glycosylated Hsp150 (see Materials and Methods section). Importantly, cells with GOMED [induced by treatment with AmphoB (Fig&#160;3M) or CBM (Fig&#160;3N), and GGA1/GGA2 deficiency (Fig&#160;3O)] exhibited a disruption of Golgi trafficking. When Golgi&#8208;to&#8208;PM trafficking is disrupted and GOMED is activated, the undelivered secretory proteins may be degraded. This hypothesis was verified by the accumulation of invertase, a secreted protein, in the vacuoles in pik1&#8208;83/atg5&#916;pep4&#916; cells after a temperature shift (Appendix&#160;Fig S7C). Taking these findings together, we concluded that a disturbance of anterograde trafficking from the Golgi to the PM is crucial for the induction of GOMED in yeast cells.</text>

      <text>To examine whether GOMED is induced in WT cells, we expressed GFP&#8208;Atg8, a known autophagy marker, and Sec7&#8208;mRFP in pik1&#8208;83 cells. The inhibition of anterograde trafficking by the temperature shift generated AB and AB&#8208;like structures, as assessed by the formation of GFP&#8208;Atg8 puncta and Sec7&#8208;mRFP puncta in the vacuoles (Fig&#160;EV3A). Freeze replica immunolabeling confirmed these findings because there were two types of structures in the vacuoles: GFP&#8208;Atg8&#8208;positive AB and Sec7&#8208;HA&#8208;positive AB&#8208;like structure (Fig&#160;EV3B), indicating the induction of autophagy and GOMED. Most structures had either one of these signals and only a few of the structures contained both signals (Fig&#160;EV3C). Note that the membrane of AB&#8208;like structure was similar to that of AB (Fig&#160;EV3B). We also examined the extent of GFP&#8208;Sft2 processing during AmphoB treatment and found that the processing in atg5&#916; cells and grh1&#916; cells (GOMED&#8208;deficient cells) was less than that of WT cells, and deletion of both genes completely abolished GFP&#8208;Sft2 processing (Fig&#160;EV3D). These data indicated that AmphoB induced GOMED even in WT yeast cells.</text>

      <text>GOMED is characterized by the generation of Golgi membrane&#8208;associated structures accompanied by proteolysis. To address whether a disruption in anterograde trafficking from the Golgi induces GOMED in mammals, we added CBM into the culture medium of Atg5&#8208;deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts [Atg5 knockout (KO) MEFs]. EM analysis showed the generation of autophagosome (AP)&#8208;like and autolysosome (AL)&#8208;like structures (Fig&#160;4A and B, and Appendix&#160;Fig S8A). The AL&#8208;like structures were well merged with the large puncta of mCherry&#8208;syntaxin 6 (Golgi marker) by CLEM analysis (Fig&#160;4C). Representative AL&#8208;like structures are identified by the enlarged ring&#8208;like immunofluorescence signals of lysosomal membrane proteins, such as Lamp1 and Lamp2, which appear due to the fusion of lysosomes and autophagosome&#8208;like structures. Such ring&#8208;like structures were increased in a time&#8208;dependent manner after CBM treatment (Fig&#160;4D and E). Furthermore, consistent with CLEM analysis, large ring&#8208;like structures of Lamp2 fluorescence were merged with GFP&#8208;syntaxin 6 (Fig&#160;4F), suggesting the involvement of the Golgi membrane in the generation of AL&#8208;like structures. Silencing of Grasp65 blocked the induction of CBM&#8208;induced large Lamp2 puncta formation (Fig&#160;4E), indicating that CBM&#8208;induced AL&#8208;like structures were generated from the Golgi membrane. We further examined whether these AL&#8208;like structures are capable of degrading proteins. To this end, we used a red fluorescent protein (RFP)&#8208;GFP tandem protein, which can detect degradation compartments because GFP fluorescence, but not RFP fluorescence, becomes weak within acidic compartments (Kimura et&#160;al, 2007). As shown in Fig&#160;4G, only a few degradation compartments (containing red fluorescence) were observed in healthy Atg5 KO MEFs, whereas CBM&#8208;treated Atg5 KO MEFs displayed many large degrading structures (Fig&#160;4G arrowheads). Importantly, all the red fluorescent compartments were merged with the large ring&#8208;like structure of Lamp2 fluorescence. These results indicated that the addition of CBM induced GOMED in Atg5 KO MEFs, as in atg5&#916; yeast cells.</text>

      <text>Because CBM inhibits Golgi&#8208;to&#8208;PM trafficking (Appendix&#160;Fig S8B), leading to the induction of GOMED, we hypothesized that the cargo molecules of Golgi trafficking as well as some Golgi membranes are digested by GOMED. To evaluate this hypothesis, we expressed the vesicular stomatitis virus ts045G protein fused to GFP (VSVG&#8208;GFP) in Atg5 KO MEFs and then treated the cells with CBM. The VSVG&#8208;GFP protein is normally transported from the Golgi to the cell surface (Presley et&#160;al, 1997). As shown in Fig&#160;4H, VSVG&#8208;GFP was degraded upon CBM treatment in a time&#8208;dependent manner. Consistently, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that a large proportion of the VSVG&#8208;GFP signals merged with the large ring&#8208;like structure of Lamp2 fluorescence in the presence of E64d (Appendix&#160;Fig S8C). E64d is a lysosomal protease inhibitor that enables the detection of intralysosomal constituents by inhibiting lysosomal enzymes. The GFP&#8208;fused mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate receptor, which is a Golgi membrane&#8208;localized protein, was also degraded by CBM (Fig&#160;4I). Collectively, these findings suggested that the cargo molecules of Golgi trafficking might be target substrates of GOMED.</text>

      <text>In WT MEFs, CBM induced conventional autophagy, but to a lesser extent than that induced upon starvation treatment, as assessed by LC3 modifications and p62 degradation (Appendix&#160;Fig S9A). When wild&#8208;type MEFs expressing GFP&#8208;syntaxin 6 and mCherry&#8208;LC3 were treated with CBM and immunostained for Lamp2, some Lamp2 puncta were colocalized with mCherry&#8208;LC3 and others were colocalized with GFP&#8208;syntaxin 6 (Appendix&#160;Fig S9B), suggesting that CBM&#8208;induced GOMED even in WT MEFs.</text>

      <text>The induction of GOMED by the inhibition of Golgi trafficking was further confirmed by genetic manipulation. EM confirmed the presence of representative GOMED structures in the Atg5 KO MEFs in which PI4K2&#945; and PI4K3&#946; were silenced, both of which are Golgi&#8208;localized PI(4)kinases (Fig&#160;4J and L), similar to those in yeast cells (Wang et&#160;al, 2003). The RFP&#8208;GFP tandem protein assay also confirmed the induction of GOMED (Fig&#160;4M). Similar results were observed when arfaptin 1, which inhibits trafficking from the Golgi to the PM (Gehart et&#160;al, 2012), was silenced in Atg5 KO MEFs (Fig&#160;4K&#8211;M). These results indicated that defects in Golgi&#8208;localized PI(4)kinases and disruption of the Golgi&#8208;to&#8208;PM pathway induce GOMED in mammalian cells.</text>

      <text>Finally, we addressed the biological roles of GOMED. Based on the observation that the disruption of Golgi trafficking induced GOMED and the knowledge that (pro)insulin granules are synthesized in the Golgi and then secreted in a similar way to Golgi&#8208;to&#8208;PM trafficking, we hypothesized that if insulin secretion was disrupted, GOMED would be activated to digest the unused insulin granules. To test this hypothesis, we deleted Atg5 from MIN6 cells (Fig&#160;EV4A and B), an insulin&#8208;secreting mouse &#946;&#8208;cell line (Miyazaki et&#160;al, 1990). The addition of CBM inhibited Golgi trafficking, so that insulin secretion was reduced (Fig&#160;EV4C). In these cells, we observed AP&#8208;like and AL&#8208;like structures enclosing insulin granules by EM (Fig&#160;EV4D&#8211;F), as observed in Atg5 KO MEFs.</text>

      <text>For investigation under more physiological conditions, we reduced the glucose concentration of the culture medium to suppress insulin secretion (Fig&#160;5A) and examined the induction of GOMED. EM analysis showed the generation of AP&#8208;like and AL&#8208;like structures enclosing and digesting insulin granules (Fig&#160;5B&#8211;D). These structures were frequently observed close to the Golgi apparatus (Fig&#160;EV4G). CLEM analysis showed that Lamp1&#8208;GFP and mCherry&#8208;syntaxin 6 signals were merged with AL&#8208;like structures (Fig&#160;5E), suggesting the Golgi membrane&#8208;mediated generation of AL&#8208;like structures. We also observed the degradation of (pro)insulin after glucose deprivation (Fig&#160;5F). Consistently, immunofluorescence analysis showed that (pro)insulin signals merged with large Lamp2 dots in glucose&#8208;deprived, but not normal, Atg5 KO MIN6 cells in the presence of E64d (Fig&#160;5G). Colocalization of these signals was not observed when lysosomal fusion was blocked by bafilomycin A1 (Fig&#160;5G). Bafilomycin A1 also blocked the reduction of (pro)insulin by glucose deprivation (Fig&#160;5F). The re&#8208;addition of glucose into the glucose&#8208;deprived medium also suppressed AP&#8208;like and AL&#8208;like structures (Fig&#160;EV4H and I) and (pro)insulin degradation (Fig&#160;EV4J). Collectively, these results indicated that (pro)insulin granules are degraded by GOMED after glucose withdrawal in MIN6 cells lacking Atg5.</text>

      <text>Similar experiments were performed using primary &#946;&#8208;cells isolated from Atg7F/F Rip&#8208;cre mice, in which Atg7 is deleted specifically in &#946;&#8208;cells (Ebato et&#160;al, 2008). We found that these cells undergo degeneration and form inclusion bodies, as previously described (Ebato et&#160;al, 2008) (Fig&#160;EV5A and B). When insulin secretion was suppressed by a reduction in the glucose concentration of the medium, we observed the induction of AP&#8208;like structures containing (pro)insulin granule (Fig&#160;6A) and degrading the insulin granules (Fig&#160;6B). Multiple Golgi vesicles were also enclosed in AP&#8208;like structures (Fig&#160;6C and D). Quantitative analysis of the EM photographs of Atg7 KO &#946;&#8208;cells revealed that AL&#8208;like structures increased at least 15&#160;min after glucose deprivation, became fully activated at 30&#160;min, and decreased at 60&#160;min (Fig&#160;6E). Bafilomycin A treatment decreased and increased AL&#8208;like structures and AP&#8208;like structures, respectively (Figs&#160;6F and EV5C). Interestingly, mitochondria and some inclusion bodies were also enclosed and degraded by GOMED structures (Figs&#160;6G and H, and EV5D and E). The degradation of mitochondria may have the effect of rapidly decreasing ATP levels, given that ATP is essential for insulin secretion.</text>

      <text>Previous investigators examining the morphology of glucose&#8208;deprived WT &#946;&#8208;cells showed that the digestion of old and fresh insulin granules was performed via crinophagy (Orci et&#160;al, 1984; Schnell &amp; Borg, 1985; Schnell et&#160;al, 1988) and starvation&#8208;induced nascent granule degradation (Goginashvili et&#160;al, 2015) (SINGD), respectively. These pathways degrade (pro)insulin granules via their direct fusion with lysosomes. We also observed extensive crinophagy/SINGD (Fig&#160;6I and J), as well as a small amount of (pro)insulin&#8208;containing autophagic vacuoles in WT &#946;&#8208;cells (Fig&#160;6K). These findings indicated that crinophagy and SINGD are the main pathways for the degradation of (pro)insulin granules in glucose&#8208;deprived WT &#946;&#8208;cells as reported previously. In contrast, in Atg7 KO &#946;&#8208;cells, crinophagy/SINGD were largely suppressed (Fig&#160;6J) (probably owing to the requirement for Atg7 in crinophagy/SINGD), and instead, GOMED was activated (Fig&#160;6K), suggesting that GOMED plays a role in compensating for crinophagy/SINGD. Because the failure of conventional autophagy is associated with type 2 diabetes (Abe et&#160;al, 2013), GOMED may play a crucial role in the regulation of insulin secretion in diabetic patients. Taken together, these findings suggest that glucose deprivation induces GOMED and digests (pro)insulin granules in Atg7 KO &#946;&#8208;cells.</text>

      <text>In this study, we showed the following novel findings: (i) Yeast cells have a novel Golgi membrane&#8208;associated degradation (GOMED) of intracellular constituents; (ii) this pathway is phylogenetically conserved from yeast to mammals; (iii) disruption of the trafficking from the Golgi to the PM is a trigger of GOMED, by which undelivered cargo molecules are degraded; and (iv) GOMED functions to digest (pro)insulin granules in glucose&#8208;deprived autophagy&#8208;deficient &#946;&#8208;cells. These findings showed the presence of a novel protein degradation pathway that can compensate for Atg5/Atg7&#8208;dependent autophagy and also indicated the molecular mechanisms and biological roles of this pathway. These findings are crucial for fully understanding intracellular protein degradation.</text>

      <text>The morphological and functional features of GOMED were quite similar to autophagy, that is, (i) the presence of structures similar to autophagosomes (double&#8208;membrane compartments) containing cytosolic and organellar constituents, (ii) the generation of AB&#8208;like and AL&#8208;like structures (single&#8208;membrane compartments), and (iii) bafilomycin&#8208;sensitive fusion between lysosomes and AP&#8208;like structures. Therefore, it might be possible to categorize GOMED as a type of autophagy, particularly with its resemblance to alternative autophagy, which is an Atg5/Atg7&#8208;independent type of bulk degradation involving autophagic structures. The machinery for alternative autophagy is also generated from Golgi membranes together with late endosome membranes and is physiologically utilized for the degradation of mitochondria during erythrocyte maturation (Honda et&#160;al, 2014). Despite the morphological and functional similarities between GOMED and autophagy, we hesitate to categorize GOMED into autophagy, because we do not have sufficient molecular evidence to conclude that these two machineries are the same. Further studies will be necessary to clarify this point.</text>

      <text>Decreased Golgi trafficking is a trigger of GOMED in both yeast and mammals. Although there are several differences between the anterograde trafficking machinery of yeast and mammals, the basic molecules involved are phylogenetically conserved. PI(4)P is one such molecule playing important roles in the biogenesis of Golgi&#8208;derived transport vesicles through its effector proteins. In this context, PI(4)P functions as a platform onto which these effector proteins are recruited. Therefore, a decrease in Golgi PI(4)P levels blocks the exit of transport vesicles, resulting in the accumulation of proteins that are delivered from the Golgi. The absence of effector proteins, such as Gga1/Gga2 in yeast and arfaptin 1 in mammals, also blocks trafficking from the Golgi (Demmel et&#160;al, 2008; Gehart et&#160;al, 2012). Given that a decrease in anterograde trafficking, but not other Golgi functions, induced GOMED in yeast and mammals, the accumulation of proteins appears to be a phylogenetically conserved trigger of GOMED. This protein accumulation may induce morphological changes of the Golgi apparatus, that is, stacking and elongation of Golgi cisternae and the induction of GOMED.</text>

      <text>Increasing lines of evidence indicate that unused or damaged cellular constituents are the target substrates of autophagy. For example, unused mitochondria were degraded by autophagy when culture conditions were shifted from aerobic to anaerobic in yeast (Priault et&#160;al, 2005). We accordingly hypothesized that GOMED may degrade undelivered proteins from the Golgi to compensate for autophagy. This hypothesis was verified by the accumulation of invertase in the vacuoles of yeast cells and the degradation of VSVG and insulin granules in Atg5 KO MEFs and Atg5 KO MIN6 cells, respectively, supporting the notion that one of the biological roles of GOMED is to avoid the accumulation of proteins in Golgi cisternae and to reduce Golgi stress. This scenario appears similar to the induction of Atg5&#8208;dependent autophagy to digest misfolded proteins in response to ER stress (Yorimitsu et&#160;al, 2006).</text>

      <text>GOMED is required in cells lacking conventional autophagy. However, this process also functions in WT cells when the Golgi&#8208;to&#8208;PM transport machinery is disrupted. When &#946;&#8208;cells are subjected to glucose deprivation, crinophagy and SINGD are the main pathways for the degradation of unused (pro)insulin and GOMED plays a subsidiary or compensatory function. In contrast, GOMED may play major roles in CBM&#8208;treated yeast cells and mammalian cells. Further studies are needed to elucidate the biological events in which GOMED is predominantly involved.</text>

To examine the efficiency of Pep4 maturation, spheroplasts were resuspended in 10&#160;ml of ice&#8208;chilled lysis buffer (0.2&#160;M sorbitol, 50&#160;mM potassium acetate, 2&#160;mM EDTA, 20&#160;mM HEPES&#8208;KOH (pH 6.8), 1&#160;mM DTT, 20&#160;mg/ml PMSF, 5&#160;mg/ml antipain, 1&#160;mg/ml aprotinin, 0.5&#160;mg/ml leupeptin, and 0.7&#160;mg/ml pepstatin) and immediately homogenized with a Potter&#8211;Elvehjem homogenizer on ice. After removal of unbroken spheroplasts, the lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 13,000&#160;&#215;&#160;g for 15&#160;min at 4&#176;C to yield an intermediate speed supernatant fraction, and further centrifuged at 100,000&#160;&#215;&#160;g for 60&#160;min at 4&#176;C to obtain crude membrane fraction.</text>

      <text>To isolate vacuole and vacuolar membrane, spheroplasts were suspended in 10 volumes of buffer A (10&#160;mM Mes/Tris (pH 6.9), 0.1&#160;mM MgCl2, 12% Ficoll&#8208;400) and homogenized with Dounce homogenizer. The solution was suspended in 10&#160;ml of buffer B (10&#160;mM MES/Tris (pH 6.9), 0.5 MgCl2, 8% Ficoll&#8208;400) and centrifuged at 51,900&#160;&#215;&#160;g for 30&#160;min at 4&#176;C. The white layer on top was collected and resuspended in buffer B, and then 5&#160;ml buffer B&#8217; (10&#160;mM MES/Tris (pH 6.9), 0.5 MgCl2, 4% Ficoll&#8208;400) was layered on top. After centrifugation (51,900&#160;&#215;&#160;g, 30&#160;min at 4&#176;C), the intact vacuoles were recovered from the top. The intact vacuoles were converted to vacuolar membrane by diluting 10 volumes of buffer C (10&#160;mM Mes/Tris (pH 6.9), 0.5&#160;mM MgCl2, 25&#160;mM KCl) followed by centrifugation (37,000&#160;&#215;&#160;g, 20&#160;min at 4&#176;C).</text>

      <text>MEFs were generated from WT, Atg5 KO embryos at E13.5, and were immortalized with SV40 T antigen. MIN6 cells were kindly provided by Prof. J. Miyazaki (Osaka University). Atg5 KO MIN6 cells were generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 system (Cong et&#160;al, 2013). Briefly, a 20&#8208;bp mouse Atg5&#8208;targeting sequence (GAGAGTCAGCTATTTGACGT) was synthesized (Eurofins) and introduced into px330 (Addgene). MIN6 cells were co&#8208;transfected with the plasmid and pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), which contains the neomycin gene, and G418 selection (800&#160;&#956;g/ml) was initiated 24&#160;h later. After 48&#160;h of selection, the MIN6 cells were reseeded to allow single colony formation. The knockout of Atg5 was confirmed by anti&#8208;Atg5 immunoblot. MEFs and MIN6 cells were grown in modified Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM).</text>

After starvation, medium was exchanged for normal culture medium (glucose 23&#160;mM) or glucose&#8208;deprived medium (glucose 0.2&#160;mM) to measure glucose&#8208;stimulated insulin secretion. After 1&#160;h, the medium was collected and the remaining cells were lysed with RIPA buffer to measure total protein content. Secreted insulin amount was measured with an ultra&#8208;sensitive mouse insulin enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Morinaga). Secreted insulin was normalized to total protein content and presented as a percentage of the non&#8208;treated cells.</text>
