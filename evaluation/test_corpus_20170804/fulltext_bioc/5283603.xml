      <text>The multi&#8208;C2 domain protein otoferlin is required for hearing and mutated in human deafness. Some OTOF mutations cause a mild elevation of auditory thresholds but strong impairment of speech perception. At elevated body temperature, hearing is lost. Mice homozygous for one of these mutations, OtofI515T/I515T, exhibit a moderate hearing impairment involving enhanced adaptation to continuous or repetitive sound stimulation. In OtofI515T/I515T inner hair cells (IHCs), otoferlin levels are diminished by 65%, and synaptic vesicles are enlarged. Exocytosis during prolonged stimulation is strongly reduced. This indicates that otoferlin is critical for the reformation of properly sized and fusion&#8208;competent synaptic vesicles. Moreover, we found sustained exocytosis and sound encoding to scale with the amount of otoferlin at the plasma membrane. We identified a 20 amino acid motif including an RXR motif, presumably present in human but not in mouse otoferlin, which reduces the plasma membrane abundance of Ile515Thr&#8208;otoferlin. Together, this likely explains the auditory synaptopathy at normal temperature and the temperature&#8208;sensitive deafness in humans carrying the Ile515Thr mutation.</text>

      <text>Mutations in OTOF, the gene coding for the multi&#8208;C2 domain protein otoferlin, cause human prelingual deafness DFNB9 (Yasunaga et&#160;al, 1999). Otoferlin is required for a late step in exocytosis in mouse inner hair cells (IHCs), as its absence nearly abolishes depolarization&#8208;induced exocytosis despite the presence of synaptic vesicles at the ribbon&#8208;type active zones (Roux et&#160;al, 2006). It was proposed that this phenotype reflects a role of otoferlin as a Ca2+ sensor of exocytosis (Roux et&#160;al, 2006; Johnson &amp; Chapman, 2010), but this idea requires further experimental testing. Indeed, in the profoundly hearing impaired pachanga mouse model (OtofPga/Pga), which carries a point mutation in otoferlin (Schwander et&#160;al, 2007), only sustained exocytosis is impaired, while fast exocytosis, reporting the fusion of the readily releasable pool (RRP), is not (Pangrsic et&#160;al, 2010). The finding of impaired vesicle replenishment led to the hypothesis that otoferlin also functions in vesicle priming, which was subsequently supported by a recent study showing a reduction in short tethers connecting synaptic vesicles with the active zone membrane in otoferlin knockout (Otof&#8722;/&#8722;) mice (Vogl et&#160;al, 2015). In addition to these putative roles in priming and fusion, otoferlin may be involved in exocytosis&#8211;endocytosis coupling via an interaction with the clathrin adapter protein AP&#8208;2 (Duncker et&#160;al, 2013; Jung et&#160;al, 2015).</text>

      <text>While most mutations in human OTOF lead to profound deafness, a defined set of missense mutations cause a striking non&#8208;syndromic recessive temperature&#8208;sensitive auditory synaptopathy (reviewed in Pangr&#353;i&#269; et&#160;al, 2012) that is exceptional in several aspects. First, at normal body temperature, patients have near&#8208;normal pure tone hearing thresholds but impaired speech recognition, especially in background noise (Starr et&#160;al, 1998). Second, psychoacoustic testing of some patients revealed severe abnormalities of loudness adaptation to continuous pure tone stimulation, also called &#8220;auditory fatigue&#8221; (Wynne et&#160;al, 2013). Third, elevation of body temperature to &#8805;&#160;38.1&#176;C due to physical activity or fever causes severe to profound deafness. In the five independent familial cases described so far, different missense mutations (Ile515Thr, Gly541Ser, Arg1607Trp and compound heterozygosity for Gly614Glu and Arg1080Pro) and an in&#8208;frame deletion (Glu1804del) were discovered (Varga et&#160;al, 2006; Romanos et&#160;al, 2009; Marlin et&#160;al, 2010; Wang et&#160;al, 2010; Matsunaga et&#160;al, 2012). Furthermore, three more missense mutations in otoferlin (Pro1987Arg, Glu1700Gln and Ile1573Thr) were described to cause moderate age&#8208;progressive hearing loss without evident temperature sensitivity (Varga et&#160;al, 2003; Chiu et&#160;al, 2010; Yildirim&#8208;Baylan et&#160;al, 2014). Unfortunately, speech perception, auditory temporal processing, auditory fatigue and temperature sensitivity have not been tested on these patients so far.</text>

      <text>The severity of the hearing impairment of otoferlin mutant mouse lines studied to date (Roux et&#160;al, 2006; Longo&#8208;Guess et&#160;al, 2007; Pangrsic et&#160;al, 2010; Reisinger et&#160;al, 2011) has precluded further functional studies at the cellular, systems and behavioural level. To address this problem, we set out to generate a novel Otof mutant mouse model with an intermediate hearing defect, which would allow us to tackle current open questions regarding the function of otoferlin in synaptic sound encoding. We generated a knock&#8208;in mouse carrying the p.Ile515Thr point mutation (in NP_001274418), which was identified in one OTOF allele in siblings suffering from severe to profound hearing loss when their body temperature rises to &#8805;&#160;38.1&#176;C (Varga et&#160;al, 2006). At normal body temperature, patients had mild low&#8208;frequency hearing loss, speech comprehension below the 10th percentile both in quiet and noise and lacked ABRs. Later analysis revealed a premature STOP codon (Arg1116*) in the second OTOF allele (A. Starr, personal communication). The hearing disorder in OtofI515T/I515T mice largely recapitulates the phenotype described in human patients, except for the temperature sensitivity. Comprehensive analyses of synaptic sound encoding in OtofI515T/I515T mice from the molecular to the systems level indicate that otoferlin is critical for reformation of synaptic vesicles from endosome&#8208;like intermediates and for the replenishment of the RRP. Finally, we provide a candidate molecular mechanism for temperature&#8208;induced deafness in humans.</text>

      <text>We introduced the Ile515Thr substitution in mouse Otof via targeted knock&#8208;in (Appendix&#160;Supplementary Methods). First, we investigated the abundance and localization of otoferlin by using immunohistochemistry and confocal fluorescence microscopy in organs of Corti of 14&#8208; to 15&#8208;day&#8208;old (P14&#8208;15) mice (Fig&#160;1). Quantifying immunofluorescence per cell, we found a 65% reduction in&#160;otoferlin levels in OtofI515T/I515T IHCs compared to wild&#8208;type (Otof+/+) controls (Fig&#160;1A, B and G). In a parallel analysis of OtofPga/Pga IHCs, a 69% reduction of protein levels was detected (Fig&#160;1C and G), close to previous results (73%, Pangrsic et&#160;al, 2010). The reduction of otoferlin in the mutant genotypes was confirmed using another anti&#8208;otoferlin antibody (Appendix&#160;Fig S1A&#8211;D). The lower protein levels in OtofI515T/I515T IHCs are likely due to a faster degradation of mutated otoferlin (Appendix&#160;Fig S1E). In OtofI515T/I515T IHCs, the remaining otoferlin localized more towards the synaptic area below the midline of the nucleus of IHCs compared to Otof+/+, while it was found more apically in OtofPga/Pga IHCs (Fig&#160;1H). In the IHCs of all genotypes, otoferlin immunoreactivity was found in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane. In OtofI515T/I515T IHCs, the otoferlin immunofluorescence at the plasma membrane relative to total cellular protein levels was unaltered as compared to Otof+/+ IHCs. In contrast, OtofPga/Pga IHCs showed an 85% lower relative membrane staining (Fig&#160;1D&#8211;F and I). Taken together, the calculated absolute level of membrane&#8208;bound otoferlin was reduced by 66% in OtofI515T/I515 and by 97% in OtofPga/Pga IHCs (Fig&#160;1J).</text>

      <text>Hearing was first assessed by ABR recordings. ABR thresholds were elevated by 20&#160;dB for pure tones and 10&#160;dB for click stimuli in young OtofI515T/I515T mice (Fig&#160;2A). The amplitude of the spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) compound action potential, approximated as the amplitude of ABR wave I in response to clicks, was reduced to one&#8208;third of the Otof+/+ littermate values, while subsequent waves were better preserved (Figs&#160;2B and C, and EV1A and B). Together, population responses indicate a mild impairment of synchronous auditory signalling already in juvenile mice. We then cross&#8208;bred OtofI515T/I515T mice with deaf Otof&#8722;/&#8722; mice in order to model the human OTOFI515T/R1116* subjects (Varga et&#160;al, 2006) even more closely. We found an additional elevation of ABR thresholds by 15&#160;dB and a further reduction of&#160;ABR amplitudes in Otof&#8722;/I515T mice, indicating a gene dosage&#8208;dependent effect (Figs&#160;2A&#8211;C and EV1A). Consistent with a primary defect of the IHC synapse, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) were present, which report active cochlear amplification and require intact mechanoelectrical transduction (Fig&#160;EV1C).</text>

      <text>Perturbations of otoferlin function have been shown to interfere with presynaptic function in IHCs (Roux et&#160;al, 2006; Pangrsic et&#160;al, 2010). To test the effect of the Ile515Thr mutation, we performed perforated&#8208;patch recordings from IHCs in P14&#8208;P17 mice at room temperature (RT). The current&#8211;voltage relationship revealed a normal voltage dependence of activation and amplitude of Ca2+ currents in OtofI515T/I515T IHCs (Fig&#160;3A and B). We then measured exocytosis as increments of plasma membrane capacitance (&#916;Cm) in response to step depolarizations to the voltage where maximal Ca2+ currents are elicited (typically &#8722;14&#160;mV). Depolarizations were followed by recovery periods of 30 to 60 s at &#8722;84&#160;mV, which precludes exocytosis triggered by voltage&#8208;gated Ca2+ influx. Comparable &#916;Cm in response to short depolarizations (2&#8211;20&#160;ms) indicated intact fusion of a normally sized RRP under these experimental conditions (Fig&#160;3C and D). Consistently, the number of ribbon synapses was normal in mutant IHCs (Fig&#160;EV1E and F). However, when OtofI515T/I515T IHCs were depolarized for 50&#160;ms or longer, exocytosis was significantly smaller than in controls (Fig&#160;3C and D). Such sustained exocytosis is thought to reflect replenishment of synaptic vesicles to the RRP and their subsequent fusion, and/or active zone clearance (Pangr&#353;i&#269; et&#160;al, 2012). The rate of sustained exocytosis was reduced to ~340 vesicles/s/active zone, compared to&#160;~700 vesicles/s/active zone in Otof+/+ IHCs (see Appendix&#160;Supplementary Methods), but was still considerably faster than in OtofPga/Pga IHCs (~200 vesicles/s/active zone, Pangrsic et&#160;al, 2010).</text>

      <text>In order to test the fusion kinetics of RRP vesicles in OtofI515T/I515T IHCs, we recorded &#916;Cm in response to fast Ca2+ uncaging by UV laser. Here, exocytosis was comparable in kinetics between OtofI515T/I515T and Otof+/+. The amplitude was significantly reduced in OtofI515T/I515T IHCs (Fig&#160;3E and F; fast and slow components reduced to 40 and 63%, respectively). This indicates that the Ile515Thr mutation does not impair the Ca2+&#8208;triggered fusion of vesicles to the plasma membrane itself, but instead impairs vesicle replenishment, potentially affecting priming, active zone clearance or yet another mechanism.</text>

      <text>In order to directly assess sound encoding at OtofI515T/I515T synapses in&#160;vivo, we performed extracellular recordings from individual SGNs, each driven by a single IHC active zone (Fig&#160;4). We found spontaneous spiking (Fig&#160;4A), sound thresholds and frequency tuning (Fig&#160;EV2A and B) of individual SGNs to be normal which corroborates our notion of intact cochlear amplification in OtofI515T/I515T mice. Upon stimulation with tone bursts at a stimulus rate of 2&#160;Hz, OtofI515T/I515T SGNs showed a near&#8208;normal onset response with a high rate of instantaneous spiking, but then underwent stronger spike rate adaptation, not reaching a steady state within the 50&#160;ms of stimulation (Fig&#160;4B and E; ratio of onset/adapted rates 5.2&#160;&#177;&#160;1.8 in OtofI515T/I515T SGNs versus 3.5&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2 in Otof+/+ SGNs, P&#160;=&#160;0.03, t&#8208;test).

All FSL estimates were first corrected for the system delay (3.6&#160;ms), for the time of the 4&#160;ms tone burst ramp to reach fibre threshold and for the travelling wave delay (up to 0.8&#160;ms according to our wild&#8208;type data set).</text>

      <text>At higher stimulus rates of 5 or 10&#160;Hz, both onset and adapted spike rates decreased dramatically (Fig&#160;4C&#8211;E). Consistent with the reduced spiking at sound onset, the first spikes then also showed a highly significant increase in latency (Fig&#160;EV2C) and jitter (Fig&#160;4F). As evoked spike rates were low and the dynamic range unchanged, rate&#8208;intensity functions of individual SGNs were shallower than normal (Figs&#160;4G and EV2D and E). The spike rates and precision of spike timing were even further decreased when continuous amplitude&#8208;modulated sound stimuli were applied (Figs&#160;4G and H, and EV2F). The enhanced adaptation and slowed recovery from adaptation were also obvious from responses to paired stimuli (Fig&#160;4I) where the half&#8208;time of recovery from forward masking was fivefold increased from 28.7&#160;&#177;&#160;5.6&#160;ms in 9 Otof+/+ to 157.5&#160;&#177;&#160;40.5&#160;ms in 13 OtofI515T/I515T SGNs (P&#160;&lt;&#160;0.001, Mann&#8211;Whitney U&#8208;test). In summary, OtofI515T/I515T SGNs show an&#160;unusual sound encoding deficit that is dominated by a use&#8208;dependent&#160;reduction of sound&#8208;evoked spiking, likely resulting from impaired replenishment of the RRP and/or impaired active zone clearance.</text>

      <text>Using prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response, we found an impairment of gap detection performance in OtofI515T/I515T mutants compared to Otof+/+ littermates (Fig&#160;EV3A&#8211;C). We propose that this is consistent with the delayed recovery from adaptation (Fig&#160;4I) and reflects the impaired vesicle replenishment during the gap. For a more sensitive method that approaches the physiological limit of gap detection abilities, we then employed operant conditioning using the Audiobox system (de Hoz &amp; Nelken, 2014). We conditioned mice to attempt to drink water only when continuous broadband noise was present. When the noise was interrupted by 90&#160;ms silent gaps, access to the water bottles was denied and drink attempts were punished by air puffs. After reaching &gt;&#160;30% discrimination performance, we introduced shorter gaps in a total of 8% of the trials. The two Otof+/+ mice avoided drinking when gaps lasted 3&#160;ms or more. This agrees well with descriptions of gap thresholds near 2&#160;ms in CBA/J mice&#160;(Radziwon et&#160;al, 2009). In contrast, OtofI515T/I515T often attempted to drink in trials with short gaps (Figs&#160;4J and EV3F). The interpolated 50% value of the normalized discrimination function&#160;was 2.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.4&#160;ms in Otof+/+ mice and 17.2&#160;&#177;&#160;4.9&#160;ms in OtofI515T/I515T.</text>

Like in other mice with synaptic transmission deficits (e.g. Buran et&#160;al, 2010; Jung et&#160;al, 2015) and patients with auditory synaptopathy/neuropathy, the deficit appears overly pronounced in ABR recordings which represent a combination of the sensitivity, the rate and the synchronicity of SGN firing.</text>

Thus, we assume that the synaptic disease mechanisms found in mice at or below physiological temperature likely describe the situation in human patients. We next assayed whether mice, like the human patients, experience an exacerbation of their hearing loss when their body temperature exceeds 38&#176;C (Varga et&#160;al, 2006). We monitored the amplitude of ABR wave I in response to click stimulation while locally applying heat to the inner ear (Fig&#160;5A&#8211;C and Appendix&#160;Fig S2). Here, we found a reversible linear decrease in ABR wave I amplitude in both OtofI515T/I515T and Otof+/+ littermate mice, with comparable average regression slopes of 0.084&#160;&#956;V/&#176;C and 0.081&#160;&#956;V/&#176;C, respectively. The effect varied considerably between animals, presumably due to variable experimental conditions. In some animals (3/6 OtofI515T/I515T and 2/6 Otof+/+), ABR amplitudes did not recover after extensive heating (Appendix&#160;Fig S2B and C), presumably indicating permanent heat damage. Nonetheless, since ABRs in the mouse model never disappeared completely, we conclude that the elevated cochlear temperature did not fully abolish sound encoding in OtofI515T/I515T mouse mutants, as it seems to be the case in human OtofI515T/R1116* patients. Thus, as the heat&#8208;induced phenotype seems to be weaker in mice compared to human patients, the cell physiological or ultrastructural effect of fever found in our mouse model might also be weaker than in human patients.</text>

      <text>Looking at differences in the protein sequence of human and mouse otoferlin which might contribute to the less pronounced heat sensitivity in mice, we found an arginine&#8208;rich insertion including an RXR motif at position 1244&#8211;1263 in the long human reference sequences (e.g. variant e; NP_001274418). While there is currently no experimental evidence which splice isoform regarding this motif is expressed in human IHCs, PCRs on mouse organ of Corti cDNA revealed that the isoform lacking this RXR motif is predominant in mouse IHCs (Fig&#160;EV4). A similar motif was described to cause a temperature&#8208;dependent decrease in surface expression of an alpha&#8208;adrenergic receptor (Filipeanu et&#160;al, 2011, 2015). We subcloned the human RXR stretch into mouse otoferlin cDNA and performed biolistic transfection into Otof&#8722;/&#8722; IHCs (Fig&#160;5E&#8211;I). RXR&#8208;otoferlin showed a strong plasma membrane immunostaining (relative to total cellular otoferlin levels), which was comparable to the values from explanted Otof+/+ cells (Fig&#160;5D and J). Otoferlin with both the Ile515Thr mutation and the RXR motif, however, displayed almost complete absence from the plasma membrane already at 37&#176;C (Fig&#160;5H&#8211;J), which is in stark contrast to mouse Ile515Thr&#8208;otoferlin (Fig&#160;1). Since the abundance of otoferlin at the plasma membrane seems to be most relevant for sound encoding in&#160;vivo, this might explain the more pronounced heat sensitivity in human patients. When comparing to the hearing phenotype of our mouse models, hearing at normal and elevated temperature in human Ile515Thr patients would best be explained by a mixture of the splice variant with RXR and the splice variant without being expressed in human IHCs.</text>

Left lane: using the primers AAGGACAGCCAGGAGACAGA and ATCTTGTCTTTGGGGCTCCT that bind before and after amino acid 168 in mouse variant 4 was used to distinguish between splice variants. For transcript variants 2 and 4, an amplicon of 155&#160;bp was expected, whereas variant 1 should give rise to a 200&#8208;bp amplicon. The PCR indicates that almost exclusively the short variant is transcribed. Right lane: using primers TCATCTACCGACCTCCAGACC and CACATCCACCTTGACCACAGC binding before and after amino acid 1242 in mouse variant 4 expected to lead to an amplicon size of 148&#160;bp for variants 1 and 4 or 208&#160;bp for variant 2. The strong band at 148&#160;bp indicates that the vast majority of cDNA molecules confirmed the expression of the short variant. In conclusion, our data indicate that transcript variant 4 seems to be the predominantly transcribed otoferlin isoform in mouse organs of Corti.</text>

      <text>We next tested for a synaptic dysfunction elicited by fever by performing patch clamp recordings of IHCs (Fig&#160;6). We recorded &#916;Cm in IHCs induced by 5&#8211;100&#160;ms depolarization steps, first at room temperature (RT), then at near physiological temperature (PT, 35&#8211;36.5&#176;C), followed by high temperature (38.5&#8211;40&#176;C). Consistent with a previous study (Nouvian, 2007), we found Ca2+ currents and exocytosis from Otof+/+ IHCs to increase when temperature was raised from RT to PT (Fig&#160;6A and B). While Ca2+ current integrals increased only by 27 and 15% in Otof+/+ (n&#160;=&#160;4) and OtofI515T/I515T (n&#160;=&#160;5), respectively, exocytosis was more strongly enhanced by warming (Fig&#160;6B) and increased 2.7&#8208; to threefold in both genotypes.</text>

      <text>We next heated the bath to 38.5&#8211;40&#176;C expecting a strong reduction of exocytosis for OtofI515T/I515T IHCs given the human fever&#8208;induced deafness. Recordings were started as soon as the temperature recorded in the bath close to the tissue was stable. Surprisingly, we found a strong decline in &#916;Cm for Otof+/+ IHCs compared to PT, especially for sustained exocytosis which was halved (Fig&#160;6C and F). This fever&#8208;induced reduction was weaker in OtofI515T/I515T (13% less than at PT; Fig&#160;6G). As a result, &#916;Cm did not differ between OtofI515T/I515T and Otof+/+ IHCs at high temperature for all depolarization durations tested (Fig&#160;6C). However, we cannot exclude that a longer heating period might have unravelled a stronger synaptic dysfunction in OtofI515T/I515T IHCs. In fact, sustained exocytosis between the genotypes appeared slightly stronger in recordings after heating. At 2&#160;min of recovery at &lt;&#160;29&#176;C, exocytosis in Otof+/+ IHCs was reduced to 52% relative to RT before heating for depolarization stimuli of &#8805;&#160;10&#160;ms (n&#160;=&#160;4), while in OtofI515T/I515T IHCs, it was reduced to 40% of initial RT values (n&#160;=&#160;3; Fig&#160;6D, F and G). Ca2+ currents were of similar size as before heating and comparable between Otof+/+ and OtofI515T/I515T IHCs. In few of these IHCs, exocytosis was tested also after a longer recovery period of 5&#8211;20&#160;min, and we recorded additional cells only after heating (Fig&#160;6E). Considering IHCs of both conditions, we found &#916;Cm levels for 100&#160;ms depolarization in Otof+/+ IHCs to be restored to 61% compared to observations at RT before heating (n&#160;=&#160;7 from 4 cells). In contrast, in OtofI515T/I515T IHCs, sustained exocytosis remained reduced (37% of initial values for 100&#160;ms depolarization, n&#160;=&#160;8 from 4 cells).</text>

      <text>Based on the loss of exocytic capacity in wild&#8208;type and mutant IHCs between PT and &#8805;&#160;38.5&#176;C, we propose that part of the synaptic machinery is thermally unstable. The poorer recovery from heat in OtofI515T/I515T IHCs and the temperature&#8208;sensitive phenotype of patients with different OTOF mutations suggest that otoferlin itself is the heat&#8208;sensitive protein and that heat instability of otoferlin is enhanced by certain mutations like Ile515Thr.</text>

      <text>Indeed, 3D structure predictions show that the isoleucine 515 points towards the hydrophobic core of the C2C domain (Appendix&#160;Fig S3), suggesting that an exchange into the more hydrophilic threonine potentially decreases the stability of the protein. Since we also did not find a change in otoferlin mRNA levels in OtofI515T/I515T organs of Corti, ruling out lower transcription levels or destabilized mRNA as a cause (Appendix&#160;Fig S4A), we hypothesized that mutations in otoferlin lead to faster protein degradation at elevated temperature. Testing the degradation rate of a series of otoferlin mutants related to human heat&#8208;induced deafness after heterologous expression in HEK293T cells, we found hardly any degradation within 2 or 24&#160;h even at elevated temperature, similar as for wild&#8208;type otoferlin (Appendix&#160;Fig S4B and C). Although the lifetime of mutated otoferlin might be shorter in IHCs (see Appendix&#160;Fig S1E), the degradation seems too slow to explain hearing loss due to elevation of the body temperature. We hypothesize that loss of otoferlin from the plasma membrane in addition to protein unfolding might explain acute IHC presynaptic dysfunction at fever.</text>

      <text>Next, we tested steady&#8208;state levels and subcellular distribution of otoferlin after prolonged incubation at elevated temperature (Fig&#160;6H&#8211;J). In cultures of P7&#8208;8 organs of Corti incubated for 24&#160;h at 37&#176;C, the physiological temperature of mice (http://www.informatics.jax.org), otoferlin protein levels in OtofI515T/I515T IHCs were reduced to 29% of Otof+/+ controls at 37&#176;C (Fig&#160;6K). After 24&#8208;h incubation at 38.5&#176;C, otoferlin protein levels were even further reduced to 21%, and, remarkably, both otoferlin and Vglut3 localized more apically in OtofI515T/I515T IHCs (Fig&#160;6L), resembling the distribution found in OtofPga/Pga IHCs (Fig&#160;1H). The relative levels of plasma membrane&#8208;bound otoferlin were strongly reduced at febrile temperature (56% of controls, Fig&#160;6M), resulting in a strong temperature&#8208;dependent reduction of the absolute amount of plasma membrane&#8208;bound otoferlin in OtofI515T/I515T IHCs (12% of controls, Fig&#160;6N).</text>

      <text>Next, we analysed the subcellular distribution of otoferlin at the ultrastructural level by performing pre&#8208;embedding immunogold labelling and electron microscopy (EM) of P15&#8208;P16 IHCs (Fig&#160;7 and Appendix&#160;Fig S5). The near absence of gold clusters in Otof&#8722;/&#8722; tissue confirmed specificity of immunogold labelling (Fig&#160;7C). In both Otof+/+ and OtofI515T/I515T IHCs, otoferlin immunogold signal was present at the plasma membrane including the active zone membrane (Fig&#160;7A, B and D&#8211;G, and Appendix&#160;Fig S5), and at vesicular structures, some of which exhibited clathrin&#8208;coated vesicle budding (Fig&#160;7I and J) indicating endosomal nature. The diameter of labelled intracellular membranous structures was, on average, larger in OtofI515T/I515T (210&#160;&#177;&#160;13&#160;nm; smallest diameter: 51&#160;nm; n&#160;=&#160;86) than in Otof+/+ IHCs (151&#160;&#177;&#160;8&#160;nm, smallest 52&#160;nm; n&#160;=&#160;82, P&#160;&lt;&#160;0.001; Fig&#160;7K) and thus clearly exceeded the typical synaptic vesicle diameter in IHCs (Chapochnikov et&#160;al, 2014). Hardly any otoferlin labelling was visible in &lt;&#160;100&#160;nm distance to the ribbons where a halo of synaptic vesicles resides, neither in Otof+/+ nor in OtofI515T/I515T IHCs, using two different pre&#8208;embedding protocols (Fig&#160;7D&#8211;G). This discrepancy to earlier immunogold studies reporting a synaptic vesicle localization of otoferlin (Roux et&#160;al, 2006) might be due to pre&#8208; versus postembedding protocols used and/or different primary antibodies and a potential masking of our antibody epitope specifically at synaptic vesicles. In contrast, immunogold labelling for the vesicular glutamate transporter Vglut3 resulted in a strong signal around the ribbon (Fig&#160;7H and Appendix&#160;Fig S5). Quantification of the gold particles revealed an overall reduction of otoferlin labelling in the cytoplasm and a strong trend towards lower levels at the membrane in OtofI515T/I515T hair cells (Fig&#160;7L and M), consistent with our immunofluorescence results. We conclude that the Ile515Thr mutation does not alter the subcellular distribution of otoferlin.</text>

      <text>The larger average diameter of otoferlin&#8208;labelled structures in OtofI515T/I515T IHCs might point towards impaired membrane turnover. We thus assessed the effects of the Ile515Thr mutation on synaptic ultrastructure and vesicle pool dynamics at 36 and 39&#176;C by performing transmission EM of IHC ribbon synapses following inhibition or stimulation of exocytosis and subsequent chemical fixation. To inhibit IHC exocytosis, isolated organs of Corti were incubated in Ca2+&#8208;free saline, while stimulation employed extracellular saline with 1.3&#160;mM Ca2+ and 40&#160;mM K+ (according to the Nernst equation&#160;depolarizing IHCs to ~&#8722;30&#160;mV). We found the number of membrane&#8208;proximal and ribbon&#8208;associated vesicles quantified in random ultrathin sections to be similar in all four conditions (stimulatory and inhibitory at 36/39&#176;C) and both genotypes (N&#160;=&#160;2 mice/condition and genotype; Fig&#160;7N and O, and Appendix&#160;Fig S6 and Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S1). The only significant effect was an increase in the number of membrane&#8208;proximal vesicles in OtofI515T/I515T as compared to Otof+/+ IHCs after stimulation at either temperature (Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S1).</text>

      <text>We next determined the vesicle diameter in all four conditions for both ribbon&#8208;associated and membrane&#8208;proximal vesicles. We found the majority of vesicle diameters to be in a 35&#8211;45&#160;nm range, consistent with previous reports from IHC ribbon synapses (Neef et&#160;al, 2007; Appendix&#160;Fig S6). Remarkably, in the membrane&#8208;proximal pool at OtofI515T/I515T synapses after stimulation at 39&#176;C, vesicles with diameter &gt;&#160;45&#160;nm were observed, that were less frequent after inhibition, and rarely observed in Otof+/+ (Fig&#160;7P, Appendix&#160;Fig S6A and Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S1). In contrast, for the ribbon&#8208;associated pool, we found more large vesicles for inhibitory than for stimulatory condition at Otof+/+ (39&#176;C) and, remarkably, even more for both conditions at OtofI515T/I515T synapses (Fig&#160;7Q, Appendix&#160;Fig S6B and Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S1).</text>

      <text>Here, we present a mouse model for auditory fatigue and otoferlin&#8208;related hearing impairment, allowing us to study the disease mechanism from molecular to systems level. Our analysis reveals that the remarkable IHC capability of indefatigable sustained exocytosis requires otoferlin. This likely involves roles of otoferlin in reformation of synaptic vesicles from endocytosed membrane as demonstrated here, in addition to tethering synaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane (Vogl et&#160;al, 2015), and priming and/or active zone clearance (Pangrsic et&#160;al, 2010; Jung et&#160;al, 2015). Presynaptic function of IHCs and sound encoding correlate with the abundance of otoferlin at the plasma membrane. We postulate that upon an elevation of the body temperature in human patients with temperature&#8208;sensitive OTOF mutations, properly folded otoferlin at the plasma membrane drops below a level critical for promoting synaptic sound encoding.</text>

      <text>Most human OTOF mutations lead to profound deafness, but some patients have residual hearing. While two mouse missense mutants, OtofI515T/I515Tand OtofPga/Pga, show a similar overall reduction of otoferlin protein levels, OtofPga/Pga IHCs, in addition, display a perturbed plasma membrane localization of otoferlin. This results in a reduction of absolute otoferlin membrane levels to only 3% of wild&#8208;type in OtofPga/Pga (Pangrsic et&#160;al, 2010 and this study), while OtofI515T/I515T IHCs retain 34%. The comparison of the hearing phenotypes of OtofI515T/I515T, OtofI515T/&#8208;, OtofPga/Pga and Otof&#8722;/&#8722; mice indicates that synaptic function and sound encoding scale with the amount of plasma membrane&#8208;bound otoferlin, which might generalize to human missense mutations. A further heat&#8208;induced reduction of the plasma membrane abundance of mouse Ile515Thr&#8208;otoferlin appeared rather slowly and the temperature&#8208;dependent hearing loss was relatively mild in OtofI515T/I515T mice.</text>

      <text>Direct comparison of mouse ABRs at febrile temperature with psychoacoustic testing of human patients is challenging. However, it seems that our mice are less susceptible to heat than human OTOFI515T/R1116* subjects who exhibit a threshold elevation by &#8805;&#160;60&#160;dB and loss of speech perception at 38.1&#176;C body temperature. Our data indicate that this may be due to the RXR motif sequence presumably present in human otoferlin which reduces the plasma membrane abundance of Ile515Thr&#8208;otoferlin beyond what we found in OtofI515T/I515T mice. The expression of this RXR motif depends on whether the first or the second splice acceptor site in exon 30 is used, which is currently unknown. Together, the lower cellular otoferlin protein levels due to the Ile515Thr mutation, the presumed presence of the RXR splice isoform, which causes a weaker potency of the Ile515Thr&#8208;otoferlin for plasma membrane localization, and a likely heat&#8208;induced protein unfolding provide a candidate mechanism for temperature&#8208;sensitive hearing loss in humans.</text>

      <text>Reconciling IHC physiological and morphological data with in&#160;vivo responses has remained difficult because of the clearly distinct experimental conditions (Buran et&#160;al, 2010; Pangrsic et&#160;al, 2010). Here, we set out to remove one important variable by combining data sets obtained near PT. Similar to a previous report (Nouvian, 2007), membrane capacitance estimates showed a ~threefold increase of exocytosis at PT compared to RT. Considering the in&#160;vitro patch clamp experiments at PT and assuming all exocytosis to occur at active zones, the calculated rate of sustained exocytosis amounts to ~2,300 vesicles/s/presynaptic active zone. This number appears very high when compared to EM counts of membrane&#8208; and ribbon&#8208;associated vesicles (on the order of 50/ribbon and with no obvious temperature dependence; Fig&#160;8, Table&#160;EV1) and the average sustained SGN firing rate of 240&#160;Hz in wild&#8208;type mice (Fig&#160;4). Possible explanations for this discrepancy include more extrasynaptic exocytosis than described (Fuchs et&#160;al, 2003), a higher failure rate than assumed from in&#160;vitro and modelling studies (Siegel &amp; Dallos, 1986; Rutherford et&#160;al, 2012) and/or synchronized multivesicular release. The mechanism of release at the hair cell synapse is a topic of active research and both synchronized multivesicular release (e.g. Glowatzki &amp; Fuchs, 2002; Graydon et&#160;al, 2011) and univesicular release through a dynamic fusion pore (Chapochnikov et&#160;al, 2014) have been put forward to explain the heterogenous size and shape of EPSCs. Based on modelling Graydon et&#160;al (2011) proposed synchronization of readily releasable vesicles by a common Ca2+ nanodomain at frog hair cell active zones, which, however, seemed insufficient to explain large and fast EPSCs in a model of the rat IHC active zone (Chapochnikov et&#160;al, 2014). The comparable vesicle diameters in EM at RT and PT for Otof+/+ mice seemingly argue against homotypic fusion of synaptic vesicles, although a rapid exocytosis of such enlarged vesicles might have prevented their detection so far.</text>

      <text>Using immunogold labelling, we found otoferlin at the plasma membrane (also reported in Roux et&#160;al, 2006) and, specifically, at the membrane of the active zones, which is consistent with a recent immunofluorescence analysis (Vogl et&#160;al, 2015). We found otoferlin labelling also at endosomal structures partially exhibiting budding of clathrin&#8208;coated vesicles, which is in agreement with STED fluorescence imaging data (Revelo et&#160;al, 2014), but not on synaptic vesicles of &lt;&#160;50&#160;nm diameter. Remarkably, in OtofI515T/I515T IHCs, we found enlarged otoferlin&#8208;labelled vesicular structures, potentially of endosomal origin, and on average larger synaptic vesicles after incubation both at 36 and 39&#176;C. In contrast, deficiency of the otoferlin interacting molecule AP&#8208;2&#956;, adapter protein for clathrin&#8208;mediated endocytosis, caused ablation of ribbon&#8208;associated vesicles distal from the active zone membrane, and a reduction of clathrin&#8208;coated structures close to ribbon synapses (Jung et&#160;al, 2015), indicating that otoferlin and AP&#8208;2&#956; act on different steps of the vesicle reformation process.</text>

      <text>In summary, we propose a new role for otoferlin in reformation of proper sized synaptic vesicles. The extent of the hearing loss in OtofI515T/I515T might be explained by such a synaptic vesicle reformation defect, given that the high vesicle turnover rates at the IHC ribbon synapse require an ultrafast vesicle reformation mechanism. However, the impaired sustained exocytosis in OtofI515T/I515T at RT points towards an additional deficit in priming (Pangrsic et&#160;al, 2010) and/or active zone clearance (Duncker et&#160;al, 2013; Jung et&#160;al, 2015).</text>

      <text>The normal size of the RRP observed in OtofI515T/I515T IHCs in&#160;vitro seems in contrast to the SGN spike rate reduction in&#160;vivo. This discrepancy can be reconciled when considering that in the voltage clamp experiment, hyperpolarization allows for RRP recovery in the absence of Ca2+ influx&#8208;driven exocytosis, while in&#160;vivo spontaneous release diminishes the occupancy of the release sites that compose the RRP, reducing the &#8220;standing&#8221; RRP. Moreover, the lower time resolution of the capacitance recordings obscures the finding of a combined reduction of rate and synchronicity of sound onset firing which is observed in single unit recordings and highlighted by the ABR amplitude reduction.</text>

      <text>At physiological temperature, the phenotype of OtofI515T/I515T mice reproduces the clinical picture very well and single SGN response recordings in OtofI515T/I515T mice provide an explanation for the apparent discrepancy between the normal sound sensitivity and the poor speech perception and ABRs in human patients: while few spikes from individual SGNs with normal thresholds may suffice for tone detection, the combination of reduced spike rates and higher jitter of action potential firing at sound onset can cause a dramatic reduction in ABR wave I amplitude, as also observed in other mutants with impaired synaptic sound encoding (Buran et&#160;al, 2010). In response to constant or repetitive stimuli, OtofI515T/I515T SGNs display markedly enhanced adaptation and slowed recovery from adaptation. This is consistent with the finding that patients with otoferlin deficiency show auditory fatigue when challenged with continuous sounds (Wynne et&#160;al, 2013). In contrast, none of the patient reports mention tinnitus as an additional symptom. We thus consider it unlikely that impairment of the perception of silent gaps in noise in our mice is due to tinnitus (Turner et&#160;al, 2006). Instead, it is likely explained by the combination of the reduction of adapted spike rates and the delayed recovery of the sound onset response. The resulting deficit in the encoding of fast fluctuations in sound envelope structure seems well consistent with the speech comprehension difficulties experienced by human patients which obviously cannot be restored by sound amplification using traditional hearing aids. Our data suggests that a more promising approach would be to devise a new speech processing strategy that aims to compensate for the increased adaptation. Clinicians should expect ABR latencies to be close to normal (Fig&#160;EV1B) and late ABR waves to be better preserved than wave I, suggesting partial compensation in the auditory brainstem. Finally, we suggest that tests for sound adaptation and temporal coding (e.g. gap detection) should be more generally applied in clinical settings to detect deficits that are independent of sound sensitivity.</text>

      <text>ABRs, DPOAE and recordings from individual SGNs were performed as described (Jing et&#160;al, 2013), except for offline action potential detection which was based on spike waveform and amplitude using a custom&#8208;written Matlab routine (see Appendix&#160;Supplementary Methods for details). For ABR recordings with local temperature changes, ABRs in response to click stimuli at 60, 80 and 100&#160;dB were measured using a custom&#8208;written Matlab routine controlling TDT system III (Tucker Davis Technologies) and a JBL 2402 speaker. A custom&#8208;designed heat probe (Appendix&#160;Fig S2A) was placed on the bony wall of the mouse bulla. The local temperature of the heat probe was constantly monitored, same for two miniaturized thermo&#8208;probes (H*MT, Newport Omega, Deckenpfronn) placed on the promontory wall within the bulla and in the mouth or in the cerebellum (accessed through a small hole in the occipital bone). Operant conditioning in the &#8220;Audiobox&#8221; was carried out essentially as described (de Hoz &amp; Nelken, 2014), and startle responses were recorded and quantified as detailed in Appendix&#160;Supplementary Methods.</text>

      <text>Organs of Corti (P14) were explanted in HEPES&#8208;Hanks solution and incubated for 1&#160;min 45&#160;s in pre&#8208;warmed Ca2+ free saline (5&#160;mM K+, 0 Ca2+ and 5&#160;mM EGTA; inhibitory condition) or in a solution containing 40&#160;mM K+ and 1.3&#160;mM Ca2+ (stimulatory condition). Samples were fixed and prepared as described (Wong et&#160;al, 2014) and detailed in Appendix&#160;Supplementary Methods. For random section analysis, electron micrographs were acquired with transmission electron microscope (JEM&#8208;1011, 80&#160;kV). For the 3D analysis, the semi&#8208;thin sections (250&#160;nm) were imaged with JEM&#8208;2100 transmission electron microscope at 200&#160;kV. Tomograms were reconstructed and analysed using IMOD package (bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/) and ImageJ. For details, see Appendix&#160;Supplementary Methods.</text>

      <text>The data were analysed using Matlab (Mathworks), Microsoft Access and Excel, the Igor Pro 6 software package (WaveMetrics), Origin 6.0 (Microcal Software) and GraphPad Prism. Averaged data are expressed as mean&#160;&#177;&#160;SEM unless otherwise specified. Normality was assessed using Jarque&#8211;Bera test for sample size of n&#160;&#8805;&#160;7 and by Kolmogorov&#8212;Smirnov test for n&#160;&lt;&#160;7. For normally distributed samples, significance was tested using the unpaired, two&#8208;tailed Student's t&#8208;test, others with Mann&#8211;Whitney U&#8208;test, unless stated otherwise. Statistical significance of fluorescence immunohistochemistry and EM analysis was calculated by one&#8208;way ANOVA followed by Tukey&#8211;Newman&#8211;Keuls test for parametric and Kruskal&#8211;Wallis test followed by non&#8208;parametric multiple comparisons (NPMC).</text>
