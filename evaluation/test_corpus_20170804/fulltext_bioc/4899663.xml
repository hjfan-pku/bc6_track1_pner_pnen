      <text>Chromatin&#8208;associated proteins are essential for the specification and maintenance of cell identity. They exert these functions through modulating and maintaining transcriptional patterns. To elucidate the functions of the Jmjd2 family of H3K9/H3K36 histone demethylases, we generated conditional Jmjd2a/Kdm4a, Jmjd2b/Kdm4b and Jmjd2c/Kdm4c/Gasc1 single, double and triple knockout mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We report that while individual Jmjd2 family members are dispensable for ESC maintenance and embryogenesis, combined deficiency for specifically Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c leads to early embryonic lethality and impaired ESC self&#8208;renewal, with spontaneous differentiation towards primitive endoderm under permissive culture conditions. We further show that Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c both localize to H3K4me3&#8208;positive promoters, where they have widespread and redundant roles in preventing accumulation of H3K9me3 and H3K36me3. Jmjd2 catalytic activity is required for ESC maintenance, and increased H3K9me3 levels in knockout ESCs compromise the expression of several Jmjd2a/c targets, including genes that are important for ESC self&#8208;renewal. Thus, continual removal of H3K9 promoter methylation by Jmjd2 demethylases represents a novel mechanism ensuring transcriptional competence and stability of the pluripotent cell identity.</text>

      <text>Embryonic development and the establishment of cellular identity are highly complex processes that require tight regulation of gene expression. Modifications on DNA and histones contribute to the establishment and maintenance of transcriptional programmes, and hence, chromatin&#8208;modifying enzymes often play pivotal roles during development (reviewed in Pedersen &amp; Helin, 2010; Young, 2011; Laugesen &amp; Helin, 2014).</text>

      <text>The JMJD2 (also known as KDM4) family of histone demethylases has activity towards di&#8208; and tri&#8208;methylated lysine 9 and lysine 36 on histone H3 (Cloos et&#160;al, 2006; Fodor et&#160;al, 2006; Klose et&#160;al, 2006; Whetstine et&#160;al, 2006). While H3K9me3 is a hallmark of heterochromatic areas and is implicated in gene silencing when covering cis&#8208;regulatory elements, H3K36me3 is found within the transcribed regions of active genes (Barski et&#160;al, 2007; Mikkelsen et&#160;al, 2007; Nestorov et&#160;al, 2013). In mammals, Jmjd2a/Kdm4a, Jmjd2b/Kdm4b and Jmjd2c/Kdm4c/Gasc1 are widely expressed, while expression of the fourth family member, Jmjd2d/Kdm4d, is largely confined to testis (Iwamori et&#160;al, 2011). The JMJD2 enzymes are considered interesting targets for the development of anti&#8208;cancer therapies, because they are overexpressed in certain human cancers and can contribute to tumour cell proliferation (reviewed in Kooistra &amp; Helin, 2012; Berry &amp; Janknecht, 2013). However, we are still missing a clear understanding of the biological functions of the JMJD2 enzymes as well as their role in transcriptional regulation. Especially, conflicting data have been published regarding the role of Jmjd2 proteins in early development. While depletion of either Jmjd2b or Jmjd2c has been reported to impair ESC self&#8208;renewal through regulation of Nanog or Polycomb targets (Loh et&#160;al, 2007; Das et&#160;al, 2014), we recently demonstrated that Jmjd2c knockout ESCs display no major phenotype (Pedersen et&#160;al, 2014). Additionally, we showed that Jmjd2c is dispensable for embryonic development and post&#8208;natal life (Pedersen et&#160;al, 2014) as previously reported for Jmjd2b (Kawazu et&#160;al, 2011). In the current study, we have systematically investigated the functional role of Jmjd2 proteins in ESC self&#8208;renewal and early development by conditional deletion of the genes. We show that the Jmjd2 demethylases have essential and redundant functions during early embryogenesis, and our results further uncover a widespread and dynamic regulation of H3K9me3 at transcription start sites. This level of regulation is vital for transcriptional competence, ESC proliferation and stabilization of stem cell identity.</text>

      <text>To characterize the functions of the Jmjd2 enzymes in development, we extended our studies of Jmjd2c/Kdm4c knockout (KO) ESCs (Pedersen et&#160;al, 2014) with the derivation and characterization of conditional Jmjd2a/Kdm4a and Jmjd2b/Kdm4b KO ESCs. We generated ESCs carrying Jmjd2a or Jmjd2b alleles with loxP sites surrounding critical exons and expressing a 4&#8208;hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) inducible Cre recombinase (CreERT2) from the Rosa26 locus. For these ESCs, deletion of the loxP flanked exons results in frameshift mutations causing translational termination before the catalytic Jumonji C (JmjC) domains (Fig&#160;1A and B). From hereon, these conditional Jmjd2a(f/f);Rosa26::CreERT2 and Jmjd2b(f/f);Rosa26::CreERT2 ESCs are referred to as 2a and 2b ESCs, respectively, as specified in Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S1.</text>

      <text>RT&#8208;qPCR analyses confirmed the deletion of exon 3 in Jmjd2a and exon 5 in Jmjd2b upon OHT treatment of 2a and 2b ESCs, respectively. Reduced levels of residual transcripts were observed, suggesting that the mutant transcripts are unstable (Appendix&#160;Fig S1A). Upon OHT treatment, Jmjd2a and Jmjd2b became undetectable by Western blot, while expression levels for other Jmjd2 family members were unaltered (Fig&#160;1C and Appendix&#160;Fig S1B).</text>

      <text>Previously, depletion of Jmjd2b has been reported to impair self&#8208;renewal of ESCs grown in serum&#8208;containing medium, leading to a decline in Nanog levels and enhanced expression of differentiation markers for all embryonic lineages (Das et&#160;al, 2014). In contrast, we did not observe impaired proliferation rates or substantially altered expression of pluripotency or differentiation markers upon genetic deletion of Jmjd2a or Jmjd2b in either 2i medium (Fig&#160;1D and E), known to promote homogenous na&#239;ve pluripotent cell cultures, or in serum&#8208;containing ESC medium (Fig&#160;1F and G, and Appendix Fig&#160;S1C).</text>

      <text>To investigate the impact of loss of Jmjd2a or Jmjd2b expression on mouse development, we intercrossed heterozygous mice to obtain KO animals. Both Jmjd2a&#8722;/&#8722; (Fig&#160;1H) and Jmjd2b&#8722;/&#8722; mice (Fig&#160;1I) were born and classified as viable (Ayadi et&#160;al, 2012; a detailed characterization of these mice will be described elsewhere). The observation that Jmjd2b is dispensable for embryonic development is in agreement with a published study (Kawazu et&#160;al, 2011), and we have previously reported that Jmjd2c is not required for ESC maintenance or mouse embryogenesis (Pedersen et&#160;al, 2014). Thus, the loss of either Jmjd2a, Jmjd2b or Jmjd2c is compatible with ESC self&#8208;renewal and embryonic development.</text>

      <text>To investigate whether functional redundancy exists within the Jmjd2 family, we generated conditional Jmjd2 double and triple KO ESCs (Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S1). Strikingly, we found that the combined loss of Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c has a drastic effect on ESC proliferation in 2i medium (Fig&#160;2A). A comparable reduction in growth rate was observed for 2abc triple KO (TKO) ESCs devoid of all three family members (Fig&#160;2B). In contrast, we did not detect impaired growth for Jmjd2a/b or Jmjd2b/c double KO (DKO) ESCs (Fig&#160;2C and D). These data imply that Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c have redundant and vital functions in ESCs that are not shared by Jmjd2b.</text>

      <text>Jmjd2a/c DKO ESCs showed increased levels of cell death (Fig&#160;2E) and appeared to undergo apoptosis as judged by the presence of cleaved caspase&#8208;3 (Appendix&#160;Fig S2A). In other cell types, Jmjd2 proteins have been implicated in various aspects of cell cycle regulation (Black et&#160;al, 2010, 2013; Kupershmit et&#160;al, 2014; Pedersen et&#160;al, 2014). While FACS analyses did not show major alterations in cell cycle distribution for KO ESCs (Fig&#160;2E), live cell imaging revealed that 2ac and 2abc KO ESCs are commonly delayed in their progression through mitosis and show evidence of defects in chromosome alignment. At the same time, we did not observe this phenotype in 2a or 2c single KO ESCs (Fig&#160;EV1A&#8211;C).</text>

      <text>The 2ac and 2abc KO ESCs retained normal levels of Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2 transcripts when maintained in 2i medium (Fig&#160;2F) and were capable of differentiating into all three germ layers (Appendix&#160;Fig S2B). 2i culture conditions promote a na&#239;ve pluripotent cell state and do not support the growth of differentiated cell types (reviewed in Hackett &amp; Surani, 2014). Thus, in addition to the observed mitotic defects, the impaired growth rate could also reflect cells exiting the pluripotent state. To investigate this idea, we assessed the effect of deleting Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c in serum&#8208;containing ESC medium, known to be permissive for functional and transcriptional heterogeneity (Hackett &amp; Surani, 2014). Interestingly, for ESCs growing in the presence of serum, loss of Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c also led to impaired proliferation (Fig&#160;2G and H), which was accompanied by reduced expression of pluripotency markers (Fig&#160;2I and J). While transcript levels for markers of trophectoderm, early ectoderm and mesoderm were not substantially altered, significant increases in the levels of the general endodermal markers Foxa2, Gata4, Gata6 and Sox17 were observed for the 2ac and 2abc KO cells cultured in serum&#8208;supplemented medium (Fig&#160;2I and J, and Appendix&#160;Fig S2C and D).</text>

      <text>During the second cell fate decision in the embryo, cells from the inner cell mass segregate into either epiblast or extra&#8208;embryonic primitive endoderm lineages. While the pluripotent epiblast gives rise to the future foetus, the primitive endoderm forms the visceral and parietal endoderm of the yolk sac (reviewed in Lanner, 2014). Interestingly, further analyses showed that specifically markers for primitive endoderm (Pdgfra and Sox7), but not embryonic definitive endoderm (Cxcr4, Gsc and Sp6), were induced upon OHT treatment of 2ac and 2abc ESCs in serum&#8208;containing medium (Fig&#160;2I and J). Single knockout ESCs did not show such gene expression pattern under these culture conditions (Appendix&#160;Fig S1C). In summary, ESCs devoid of Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c are characterized by strong proliferation defects and destabilization of the na&#239;ve pluripotent cell state with spontaneous differentiation towards primitive endoderm in permissive culture conditions.</text>

      <text>To explore the developmental potential of Jmjd2a/c deficient ESCs, we injected control and OHT&#8208;treated GFP&#8208;labelled 2ac ESCs (Appendix&#160;Fig S3A) into E2.5 morulas and monitored their embryonic contribution during in&#160;vitro culture. Twenty&#8208;four hours after injection (early blastocyst stage), wt and 2ac DKO cells contributed to the embryonic inner cell mass to the same extent (Fig&#160;3A and B). Interestingly, after two additional days of culture (transition to the late blastocyst stage), DKO cells failed to expand (Fig&#160;3A and B) despite majorly maintaining Nanog expression (Appendix&#160;Fig S3B). This indicates that while ESC identity and homing to the proper embryonic compartment are preserved, 2ac DKO ESCs exhibit in&#160;vivo self&#8208;renewal defects. This is consistent with the results observed in 2i culture, a condition that most closely resembles the embryonic epiblast in&#160;vitro (Boroviak et&#160;al, 2014). Interestingly, in a few rare cases, we observed Nanog&#8208;negative DKO cells in late chimeric blastocysts (Appendix&#160;Fig S3B), which could indicate their differentiation into primitive endoderm in an embryonic context.</text>

      <text>To investigate the requirement for Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c in embryogenesis, we determined the viability of DKO mice. The loci encoding Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c are both located on chromosome 4 ~40&#160;MB apart and are thus expected to co&#8208;segregate with a frequency related to the rate of meiotic recombination. No live homozygous null pups were obtained from Jmjd2a+/&#8722;; Jmjd2c+/&#8722; intercrosses (Fig&#160;3C), and no DKO embryos were recovered early in development at embryonic day 6.5 (E6.5; Fig&#160;3D). Furthermore, at E6.5, the Jmjd2a+/&#8722;; Jmjd2c+/&#8722; females contained a large number of empty decidua (23%, compared to 4% in controls), indicating that DKO embryos possibly implant in the uterus, but are resorbed shortly thereafter, which could be due to the observed phenotypic defects in pluripotent cells.</text>

      <text>To gain insight into how Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c regulate ESC self&#8208;renewal, we identified Jmjd2a binding patterns genomewide. All mechanistic studies were performed with ESCs grown in 2i medium to ensure homogeneity of the analysed cell populations. ChIP sequencing was performed using mock&#8208; and OHT&#8208;treated conditional 2a ESCs. The OHT&#8208;treated sample devoid of Jmjd2a was used as the negative control in subsequent bioinformatics analyses identifying 11,654 Jmjd2a binding sites, of which 70% were located within &#177;&#160;1&#160;kb of an annotated transcription start site (TSS) (Fig&#160;4A&#8211;C, Table&#160;EV1). We have previously reported that Jmjd2c is targeted to H3K4me3&#8208;positive regions by its double Tudor domain, which specifically recognizes this modified residue (Pedersen et&#160;al, 2014). H3K4me3 marks CpG islands and TSSs of actively transcribed genes (Mikkelsen et&#160;al, 2007; Illingworth et&#160;al, 2010). The double Tudor domain of Jmjd2a has been shown to bind methylated H3K4 and methylated H4K20 in&#160;vitro (Huang et&#160;al, 2006; Kim et&#160;al, 2006; Lee et&#160;al, 2008). As observed for Jmjd2c, we found that Jmjd2a localizes to H3K4me3&#8208;positive TSSs (Fig&#160;4A and C). Indeed, 99% of TSS&#8208;associated and 88% of non&#8208;TSS&#8208;associated Jmjd2a peaks directly overlap an H3K4me3 peak (Fig&#160;4D). In agreement with the comparable binding patterns (Fig&#160;4, Appendix&#160;Fig S4A&#8211;C and Table&#160;EV1), a strong co&#8208;localization between Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c was detected: 88% of TSS&#8208;associated Jmjd2a peaks overlap a Jmjd2c peak (Fig&#160;4E), and 8,245 TSSs were bound by both Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c (Fig&#160;4F).</text>

      <text>Jmjd2a association with selected targets was validated in independent ChIP experiments with different antibodies recognizing Jmjd2a (Fig&#160;4G). Experiments using single KO ESCs showed that loss of Jmjd2c expression did not alter the binding pattern of Jmjd2a, and that Jmjd2a&#8722;/&#8722; ESCs displayed normal levels of Jmjd2c binding at tested binding sites (Fig&#160;4G). Thus, Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c localize to chromatin independently of each other in agreement with the hypothesis that Jmjd2a, like Jmjd2c, is recruited to chromatin through the double Tudor domains recognizing H3K4me3. Supporting this notion, sequential ChIP (re&#8208;ChIP) experiments showed that chromatin precipitated with either Jmjd2a or Jmjd2c antibodies was enriched for the H3K4me3 mark. In contrast, these&#160;experiments did not provide evidence that Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c&#160;bind&#160;simultaneously to the same DNA fragments (Appendix&#160;Fig S4D and E). This suggests that Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c dynamically replace each other at H3K4me3&#8208;marked regions instead of co&#8208;localizing in&#160;vivo.</text>

      <text>The Jmjd2 enzymes catalyse the demethylation of lysine 9 and lysine 36 on histone H3, and increased levels of H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 could be detected for both 2ac and 2abc KO ESCs by Western blotting (Fig&#160;EV2A and B). To characterize the impact of Jmjd2 proteins on histone methylation levels in more detail, ChIP sequencing was conducted with antibodies specifically recognizing H3K9me3 and H3K36me3. Notably, we observed a clear change in overall histone methylation patterns at Jmjd2a/c occupied sites upon OHT treatment of 2ac ESCs. Density plots revealed that bound TSSs exhibit a decrease in average H3K9me3 levels specifically at the Jmjd2 occupied region in wt cells. Importantly, this dip was resolved in DKO ESCs, which show an overall accumulation of H3K9me3 at the same regions (Fig&#160;5A). Furthermore, H3K36 methylation levels were also increased at Jmjd2a/c bound sites in DKO ESCs as OHT treatment induced a shift in the average H3K36me3 distribution towards the TSS (Fig&#160;5A). In contrast, TSSs not occupied by Jmjd2a or Jmjd2c did not show comparable gain in H3K9 or H3K36 methylation, confirming that only specific genomic elements are affected upon loss of Jmjd2 function (Fig&#160;5A lower panel).</text>

      <text>To ensure reproducibility, ChIP&#8208;seq data were obtained for 2 independent experiments involving different 2ac and 2abc ESC lines. Correlation and principal component analyses (PCA) of H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 distributions across TSS regions demonstrated that the KO samples were more similar to each other than to the mock&#8208;treated controls (Fig&#160;EV2C and D). Density plots showed a shift in H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 profiles specifically at Jmjd2a/c occupied TSSs for all OHT&#8208;treated samples (Fig&#160;EV3A). Further analyses revealed that a substantial fraction of TSS regions consistently displayed altered methylation patterns upon loss of Jmjd2a/c function with the gain in H3K9 and/or H3K36 trimethylation differing between the bound sites (see e.g. Figs&#160;5B and C, and EV3B and C). Only subtle alterations in histone H3 levels were detected by ChIP&#8208;seq and in ChIP validations demonstrating that the changes in methylation patterns did not simply reflect alterations in nucleosome density (Figs&#160;EV3A and C, EV4 and 5C). Interestingly, 2ac and 2abc ESCs showed comparable changes in methylation levels upon OHT treatment at analysed regions (Figs&#160;5B and EV3A and B), as confirmed by independent ChIP&#8208;qPCR validations (Figs&#160;5C, EV3C and EV4B). In agreement with this, the H3K9me3 2ac+OHT and 2abc+OHT samples clustered together instead of forming 2 distinct groups in the PCA and correlation analyses (Fig&#160;EV2C and D). Thus, Jmjd2b appears to play a minor role in the regulation of H3K9 trimethylation at Jmjd2a/c bound sites in ESCs. Furthermore, Jmjd2 single KO ESCs did not display comparable increases in H3K9me3 or H3K36me3 levels at regions analysed by ChIP&#8208;qPCR (Fig&#160;5C), implying that Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c function redundantly in the regulation of histone methylation. The synergistic effect of loss of both family members is in agreement with their redundant role in maintaining ESC self&#8208;renewal and normal embryonic development.</text>

      <text>Recruitment of the Jmjd2 H3K9/H3K36 demethylases to H3K4me3&#8208;marked nucleosomes provides an example of the complex interplay between histone modifications. To assess whether loss of Jmjd2a/c function also had an impact on H3K4me3 levels, we included this mark in the ChIP&#8208;seq analyses. While only minor alterations were observed for the overall H3K4me3 profiles upon loss of Jmjd2a/c expression (Fig&#160;EV3A), a modest reduction in average H3K4me3 levels could be observed at the TSS regions with the greatest increase in H3K9me3 (Fig&#160;EV4A and B).

      <text>To elucidate whether Jmjd2 proteins contribute to transcriptional regulation, we performed gene expression analyses on 2ac and 2abc ESC lines. Loss of Jmjd2 proteins led to the deregulated expression of several hundred genes of which ~40% were found to contain binding sites for both Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c within &#177;&#160;1&#160;kb of their TSS (Appendix&#160;Fig S6A and B and Table&#160;EV2). Most down&#8208; or up&#8208;regulated genes showed similar trends of deregulation in the 2ac and 2abc KO cells (Appendix&#160;Fig S6A, C and D), and validation experiments confirmed that 2ac and 2abc KO ESCs exhibit comparable transcriptional changes (Fig&#160;6A and B). In contrast, the transcriptional effects were generally not recapitulated in the Jmjd2 single KO ESCs (Appendix&#160;Fig S6E), in agreement with the results from the phenotypic characterization.</text>

      <text>The expression analysis was conducted using ESCs maintained in 2i medium to prevent confounding effects of differentiated cells in the culture and therefore did not recapitulate the altered expression of, for example, endodermal markers observed for DKO/TKO ESCs in serum culture. Nevertheless, Gene Ontology (GO) analyses showed that genes with deregulated expression upon loss of Jmjd2a/c were enriched for functions related to various developmental processes (Appendix&#160;Fig S6F). In line with the phenotypic characterization, the GO analyses thus support the notion that lack of Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c can destabilize pluripotent stem cell identity even under conditions promoting a na&#239;ve ground state.</text>

Strikingly, we observed a very strong and reproducible increase in H3K9me3 specifically at the TSSs of Jmjd2a/c bound genes with impaired expression upon OHT treatment (Figs&#160;6C and EV5A). Genes with unaltered or enhanced expression levels displayed only modest alterations in H3K9 methylation, and a comparable gain in H3K9me3 was also not observed at down&#8208;regulated genes without Jmjd2a/c binding, demonstrating that it did not represent a secondary effect of transcriptional silencing (Figs&#160;6C and EV5A).</text>

      <text>Focusing on H3K36me3, we found only slightly elevated average methylation levels near Jmjd2a/c binding sites for genes with unaltered or increased expression (Figs&#160;6D and EV5). As expected, the increase in H3K36me3 extended downstream from the TSS for up&#8208;regulated genes. For this group of genes, comparable methylation patterns were seen independent of Jmjd2a/c binding, implying that the observed effects related to transcription levels rather than reflecting Jmjd2a/c&#8208;mediated demethylation. Thus, in contrast to the data obtained for H3K9me3, these analyses did not show a strong correlation between Jmjd2a/c&#8208;dependent control of H3K36me3 and transcriptional changes.</text>

      <text>The profiles presented in Figs&#160;6C and EV5A demonstrate that Jmjd2a/c targets with impaired transcription in KO ESCs have an overall increase in promoter H3K9me3 levels. As an alternative approach to investigate how H3K9me3 demethylation correlates with transcriptional changes, we again focused on the TSS regions with the greatest increase in average H3K9me3 levels across all ChIP&#8208;seq experiments (see Fig&#160;EV4). Importantly, the microarray data revealed that most corresponding genes showed a decline in overall expression levels upon depletion of Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c (Fig&#160;6E). These data further support the conclusion that Jmjd2&#8208;mediated control of H3K9 methylation is important for transcriptional activity.</text>

      <text>Among the down&#8208;regulated Jmjd2a/c target genes with a substantial increase in H3K9me3 levels were several that could contribute to the observed phenotypes (Figs&#160;6A, 5C, EV3C and EV4B). Particularly, lack of either Ttyh1 or Klf5 impairs embryo development around the blastocyst stage (Ema et&#160;al, 2008; Kumada et&#160;al, 2010). Whereas loss of Ttyh1 leads to mitotic failure (Kumada et&#160;al, 2010), lack of Klf5 impairs epiblast expansion and promotes primitive endoderm differentiation (Lin et&#160;al, 2010). Results suggest that Csf2ra is important for blastocyst viability (Robertson et&#160;al, 2001), Tcl1 and Pim3 have reported roles in ESC self&#8208;renewal (Aksoy et&#160;al, 2007; Bourillot et&#160;al, 2009; Miyazaki et&#160;al, 2013), and Poc1b, Mis18bp1 and Ska1 have all been implicated in the regulation of chromosome segregation and/or mitosis (Hanisch et&#160;al, 2006; Fujita et&#160;al, 2007; Venoux et&#160;al, 2013).</text>

Ectopic expression of wt Jmjd2c, but not the catalytic mutant, reverted the global increase in H3K9me3 observed upon depletion of endogenous Jmjd2a/c as well as the expression of selected important target genes (Fig&#160;7B and Appendix&#160;Fig S7B). Additionally, the growth defect caused by loss of Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c was rescued by ectopic expression of wt, but not catalytically inactive Jmjd2c (Fig&#160;7C).</text>

      <text>One of the main findings of this study is that lack of either Jmjd2a or Jmjd2b is compatible with mouse ESC self&#8208;renewal and embryonic development, analogous to what we have previously demonstrated for Jmjd2c (Pedersen et&#160;al, 2014). These results are in contrast to previous reports. Loh et&#160;al (2007) concluded, based on siRNA&#8208;depletion experiments, that Jmjd2c directly regulates Nanog expression in mouse ESCs, a finding that was not reproduced in other studies (Das et&#160;al, 2014; Pedersen et&#160;al, 2014). Wang et&#160;al (2010) observed a developmental arrest prior to the blastocyst stage upon dsRNA&#8208;mediated knockdown of Jmjd2c in mouse oocytes. More recently, Das et&#160;al found that depletion of either Jmjd2b or Jmjd2c in mESCs caused a general differentiation towards most lineages. Jmjd2b depletion was reported to affect Nanog levels, and Jmjd2c was suggested to repress Polycomb target genes, but the phenotypes were not linked to regulation of H3K9 methylation (Das et&#160;al, 2014). The discrepancies between the reported phenotypes could relate to differences in genetic backgrounds, culture conditions and the use of knockdown constructs versus the study of KO cells. Importantly, the conclusions presented in our study are based on characterization of conditional KO ESCs, thus ruling out off&#8208;target effects commonly associated with the use of si/shRNA. Additionally, our findings regarding ESC self&#8208;renewal are supported by the observations that single Jmjd2 KO mice are born and viable, demonstrating that individual Jmjd2 family members are dispensable for pluripotency in&#160;vivo (this study and Iwamori et&#160;al, 2011; Kawazu et&#160;al, 2011; Pedersen et&#160;al, 2014).</text>

      <text>In contrast to the dispensability of any single Jmjd2 gene product, we found that Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c have redundant, essential functions at early developmental stages. The combined loss of Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c impairs pluripotent cell proliferation in&#160;vitro and in&#160;vivo and destabilizes their cellular state leading to spontaneous differentiation towards primitive endoderm under permissive culture conditions. In agreement with the central function in pluripotent cells, lack of both Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c causes embryonic lethality prior to E6.5. The observed phenotypes are likely to represent the consequence of deregulated expression of multiple target genes. Indeed, we identified several genes with reported roles in ESC self&#8208;renewal, embryogenesis and cell cycle progression among the Jmjd2a/c targets.</text>

      <text>Based on our mechanistic studies, we propose a model in which both Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c are recruited through their double Tudor domains to H3K4me3&#8208;positive TSSs, where they dynamically replace each other and continuously prevent accumulation of H3K9me3 as well as H3K36me3 (Fig&#160;8). Our data imply that the function of Jmjd2b is distinct from that of these two family members, and in agreement with this, a significant fraction of Jmjd2b binding sites was recently reported to be located distant from TSSs (Das et&#160;al, 2014). For the regions with a substantial gain in H3K9 methylation, we observe a modest decline in H3K4me3 levels. While this may relate to the impaired transcription, it is also possible that H3K9 methylation more directly interferes with H3K4me3 deposition at these sites. Our results identify Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c as central regulators of the chromatin signature of H3K4me3&#8208;marked regions and provide additional evidence for co&#8208;regulation of H3K4 and H3K9 methylation, as also suggested by other studies (Shi et&#160;al, 2011; Binda, 2013).</text>

In the absence of Jmjd2a/c catalytic activity, substantial increases in H3K9me3 levels at specific loci impair gene expression, which perturb the transcriptional programme required for embryonic stem cell identity, proliferation and embryonic development.</text>

      <text>An important implication of our data is that numerous TSSs are continuously targeted by H3K9 and H3K36 methyltransferases. H3K36me3 is deposited within transcribed regions by the methyltransferase Setd2 (reviewed in Venkatesh &amp; Workman, 2013), and our data are consistent with a model in which Jmjd2a and Jmjd2c ensure chromatin boundaries by removing H3K36me3 aberrantly deposited near TSSs during this process. The H3K9me3 methyltransferase Setdb1 localizes to a number of promoter regions in ESCs (Bilodeau et&#160;al, 2009; Yuan et&#160;al, 2009), but in agreement with the notion that Setdb1 is not the sole enzyme responsible for TSS&#8208;associated H3K9 methylation, Jmjd2a/c&#8208;dependent H3K9me3 accumulation is&#160;not restricted to Setdb1&#8208;bound regions (M.T.

      <text>Notably, we further demonstrate that Jmjd2&#8208;dependent control of H3K9me3 levels at promoter regions is vital for transcriptional activity. Our data highlight regulation of H3K9 methylation as an important factor in cell fate specification. This is further supported by the fact that several H3K9 methyltransferases are essential for development (reviewed in Nestorov et&#160;al, 2013) and recent studies demonstrating that specifically H3K9 methylation can act as a barrier for reprogramming of somatic cells to the pluripotent stage (Antony et&#160;al, 2013; Chen et&#160;al, 2013; Matoba et&#160;al, 2014).</text>

In these cells, a lacZ&#8208;Neo&#8208;reporter cassette flanked by FRT sites is inserted between exons (exons 2 and 3 for Jmjd2a and exons 4 and 5 for Jmjd2b) and LoxP sites surround critical exons (exon 3 of Jmjd2a and exon 5 of Jmjd2b). Targeted ESCs were injected into BALB/c blastocysts and chimeric animals obtained. Black offspring of these chimeras were crossed with Flp&#8208;recombinase expressing mice to obtain mice with conditional Jmjd2a and Jmjd2b alleles (Jmjd2af/f and Jmjd2bf/f). To determine viability, the conditional mice were first crossed with mice constitutively expressing Cre recombinase, and heterozygous animals (Jmjd2a+/&#8722; and Jmjd2b+/&#8722;) were subsequently intercrossed. Chi&#8208;square tests were used to obtain P&#8208;values for the observed genotypic distributions.

      <text>Western blots for modified histones were quantified using the Analyze&#8208;Gels function in ImageJ. Following incubation with antibodies recognizing modified histones, each membrane was extensively washed (PBS&#160;+&#160;0.1% Tween&#160;+&#160;0.1% NaN3, followed by PBS&#160;+&#160;0.1% Tween) and reprobed with an H4 antibody. The obtained H4 signal was used to calculate relative changes in H3K9 and H3K36 methylated histones. Antibodies are listed in Appendix&#160;Supplementary Methods.</text>

      <text>For microarray analyses, RNA isolated from three independently established ESC lines of 2ac and 2abc ESCs, respectively, was grown in the absence or presence of OHT for 12&#160;days to obtain full recombination. After additional two passages, cells were harvested and total RNA extracted using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Samples were labelled and hybridized to Agilent SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8&#215;60K arrays (Agilent G4852A) according to manufacturer's instructions using LowInput QuickAmp Labeling Kit One Color (Agilent #5190&#8208;2305), One&#8208;Color RNA Spike&#8208;In kit (Agilent #5188&#8208;5282) and Gene Expression Hybridization kit (Agilent #5188&#8208;5242).

      <text>For ChIP experiments, ESCs were fixed for 10&#160;min in 1% formaldehyde in PBS and the reaction was quenched by addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125&#160;M. The cross&#8208;linked cells were harvested in SDS lysis buffer (100&#160;mM NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 50&#160;mM Tris&#8211;HCl (pH 8.0), 5&#160;mM EDTA, 0.02% NaN3 and protease inhibitors), and nuclei pelleted and resuspended in IP buffer (100&#160;mM NaCl, 0.25% SDS, 2.5% Triton X&#8208;100, 50&#160;mM Tris&#8211;HCl (pH 8.3), 5&#160;mM EDTA, 0.02% NaN3 and protease inhibitors). Samples were sonicated (Bioruptor, Diagenode) to an average length of 200&#8211;500&#160;bp. Chromatin resuspended in IP buffer was immunoprecipitated with Protein A Sepharose beads (GE healthcare) after overnight incubation with antibodies. Beads were washed 3&#215; with low&#8208;salt wash buffer [150&#160;mM NaCl, 1% Triton X&#8208;100, 0.1% SDS, 2&#160;mM EDTA, 20&#160;mM Tris&#8211;HCl (pH 8.0)] and 3&#215; with high&#8208;salt wash buffer [500&#160;mM NaCl, 1% Triton X&#8208;100, 0.1% SDS, 2&#160;mM EDTA, 20&#160;mM Tris&#8211;HCl (pH 8.0)] before decross&#8208;linking in 1% SDS, 0.1&#160;M NaHCO3 for 8&#8211;16&#160;h at 65&#176;C. Decross&#8208;linked DNA was purified using Qiagen PCR Purification kit.</text>
