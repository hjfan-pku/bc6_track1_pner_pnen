      <text>Although proteasome inhibitors (PIs) are used as anticancer drugs to treat various cancers, their relative therapeutic efficacy on stem cells vs. bulk cancers remains unknown. Here, we show that stem cells derived from gliomas, GSCs, are up to 1,000&#8208;fold more sensitive to PIs (IC50, 27&#8211;70 nM) compared with their differentiated controls (IC50, 47 to &#187;100 &#956;M). The stemness of GSCs correlates to increased ubiquitination, whose misregulation readily triggers apoptosis. PI&#8208;induced apoptosis of GSCs is independent of NF&#8208;&#954;B but involves the phosphorylation of c&#8208;Jun N&#8208;terminal kinase as well as the transcriptional activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress&#8208;associated proapoptotic mediators. In contrast to the general notion that ER stress&#8208;associated apoptosis is signaled by prolonged unfolded protein response (UPR), GSC&#8208;selective apoptosis is instead counteracted by the UPR. ATF3 is a key mediator in GSC&#8208;selective apoptosis. Pharmaceutical uncoupling of the UPR from its downstream apoptosis sensitizes GSCs to PIs in vitro and during tumorigenesis in mice. Thus, a combinational treatment of a PI with an inhibitor of UPR&#8208;coupled apoptosis may enhance targeting of stem cells in gliomas.</text>

      <text>Gliomas, malignancies originating from glial cells in the brain, are the most common malignant tumors occurring in the central nervous system and one of the most expensive cancers to treat 1. Despite advances in therapeutic strategies over past decades, patient outcomes are very poor and the median patient survival is still &lt; 2 years after diagnosis, making gliomas a significant public health issue 1. To date, alkylating agents, including temozolomide (TMZ) and nitrosoureas, are the most commonly used chemotherapy treatments in the clinic 2. However, malignant gliomas are resistant to conventional chemotherapy and are highly recurrent in a local fashion after surgical removal, mainly due to the diffuse invasion of tumor cells into the brain 3. One reason for this poor responsiveness is the phenotypic heterogeneity of gliomas, which are composed of a mixture of various cell types, including more differentiated astrocyte&#8208;like cells and a rare subpopulation that displays stem cell characteristics called glioma stem cells (GSCs) 4, 5, 6. Similar to other cancer stem cells, GSCs are defined as a highly tumorigenic cell subset responsible for in vivo tumor growth and propagation through their characteristic capacities for indefinite self&#8208;renewal and differentiation into a non&#8208;tumorigenic bulk tumor cell population 7. GSCs have been implicated in resistance of the tumor to chemo&#8208; and radiotherapy 5, 8, angiogenesis by elevated expression of VEGF 9, and aggressive invasive phenotype 10, contributing to tumor recurrence and the failure of conventional therapies. As conventional therapies targeting the rapidly proliferating bulk of tumor cells are likely to fail in targeting the GSC population, GSCs are emerging as an attractive therapeutic target to control glioma growth and progression 4.</text>

      <text>The Ub&#8208;proteasome system (UPS) mediates Ub&#8208;dependent degradation of short&#8208;lived proteins through the proteasome 11, 12. The UPS targets short&#8208;lived regulators involved in various processes such as cell cycle control, DNA repair, apoptosis, tumor growth, and stress response to maintain cellular homeostasis 13, 14, 15, 16. The timely degradation of these substrates is essential for cancer cell growth and survival. Moreover, owing to uncontrolled proliferation, cancer cells accumulate abnormal proteins more rapidly and, thus, are more sensitive to proteasomal inhibition than normal cells 13. Many PIs such as lactacystin, MG132, bortezomib/PS341 (marketed as Velcade&#174;), epoxomicin, and SC68896 show antiproliferative or proapoptotic activity in various hematological and solid malignancies at IC50 values of 1&#8211;10 &#956;M 13, 17. Bortezomib is the first FDA&#8208;approved drug for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma 17 and demonstrates anticancer activity in vitro against various cancer cell lines, including those derived from colon, ovary, pancreas, lung, breast, bladder, and prostate cancers 18. Recent studies suggest that PIs can also induce apoptosis in human glioma cell lines and primary glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) explants 19, 20. PIs were also shown to induce apoptosis in glioma&#8208;derived stem&#8208;like cells 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. In a recent siRNA screening to identify genes important for GBM cell survival, 22% (12/55) of the hits were components of the 20S and 26S proteasome subunits 26. Although the action mechanisms still remain poorly understood, extensive studies have shown that inactivation of the NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway significantly contributes to the apoptotic death of cancer cells caused by PIs at 1&#8211;10 &#956;M 27. Despite the demonstrated therapeutic efficacy of PIs as anticancer agents, clinical studies have reported that many solid tumors do not respond well to PI treatments, possibly because of inaccessibility to cancer stem cells within the tumors, limiting their therapeutic potential 28. It remains poorly understood whether and, if so, to what degree PIs have differential cytotoxic activities on stem cells embedded in bulk tumors.</text>

      <text>In this study, we show that PIs selectively kill GSCs (IC50, 27&#8211;70 nM) as compared with their non&#8208;stem differentiated controls (IC50, 47 &#956;M to &#187; 100 &#956;M). GSC&#8208;selective apoptosis is independent of NF&#8208;&#954;B but requires the transcription factor ATF3. The ATF3&#8208;dependent killing of GSCs involves the transcriptional activation of so&#8208;called endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress&#8208;associated apoptosis. In contrast to known properties of many non&#8208;stem cancer cells, however, pharmaceutical uncoupling of the UPR from apoptosis renders GSCs even more sensitive to PIs. Our results suggest that a combination treatment of a PI with an inhibitor of UPR&#8208;coupled apoptosis may be useful to target stem cells in gliomas.</text>

      <text>We have previously established a suspension culture model of human primary GSC lines (XO1, XO2, XO3, XO4, XO6, XO8, XO9, and XO10) from gliomas of patients 29, 30. In this study, we induced the differentiation of XO6, XO8, and XO10 GSCs by passaging them seven times on an adhesive surface in serum&#8208;containing media. Semi&#8208;quantitative PCR and immunoblotting analyses of GSCs and their differentiated, non&#8208;stem glioma cancer cells (DFCs; see Materials and Methods) showed that GSC&#8208;specific stemness markers, such as Nestin, Musashi&#8208;1 and SOX2, were selectively expressed in GSCs and gradually downregulated in the course of differentiation (Fig 1A and B). Similar passage&#8208;dependent downregulation was observed with general stem cell markers, including NANOG, OCT4, i&#8208;NOS, and Olig2. The expression of GFAP and &#946;III&#8208;tubulin, markers of astrocyte and neuronal differentiation, respectively, was activated at passages 2 through 4 and subsequently returned to basal levels (Fig 1B). Following differentiation, the doubling time increased from 16 h in GSCs to 32 h in DFCs (Fig 1C).</text>

Consistent with our previous observations with other XO GSCs 29, 30, approximately 13% of XO8 GSCs were CD133+ as compared with 1% for DFCs (Fig 1D). Moreover, 0.37% of XO8 GSCs were GFAP+ as compared with 97.3% for DFCs (Fig 1D). These results were confirmed using Western blot analysis (Fig 1E).</text>

      <text>We have previously validated the high tumorigenicity of XO1 GSCs in mice 31, 32. To determine the tumorigenicity of XO8 GSCs, we injected XO8 GSCs and DFCs into the brains of BALB/c nude mice and compared tumorigenesis. None of the mice receiving 103, 104, or 105 XO8 DFCs developed tumors. By contrast, only 103 XO8 GSCs was sufficient to induce tumors (Fig 1F and G). These results validate the model of GSCs and DFCs of this study.</text>

      <text>Despite the demonstrated therapeutic efficacy of PIs on various cancers, their relative cytotoxicity to stem cells vs. bulk cancer cells has not been systematically characterized. To develop a strategy targeting stem cells, we treated GSCs and DFCs with various anticancer agents and measured their cytotoxicity using mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase activity (see Materials and Methods). GSCs showed no significant difference to TMZ (IC50, 3 mM) and cisplatin (IC50, 22 &#956;M), first&#8208; and second&#8208;line chemotherapeutic drugs for glioma, respectively, as compared with their non&#8208;stem controls (Fig 2A and B). Similar results were obtained with other types of anticancer agents (adriamycin, taxol, and TRAIL) as well as the autophagic inhibitor bafilomycin A1 and the ER stressor thapsigargin (Fig 2C&#8211;G). Strikingly, XO8 GSCs (IC50, 75 nM) were unusually sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor MG132 as compared with TMZ (IC50, 3 mM) and cisplatin (IC50, 22 &#956;M) (Fig 2H). Moreover, XO8 GSCs (IC50, 75 nM) were strikingly more sensitive to MG132 than GSC&#8208;derived non&#8208;stem controls (DFCs) (IC50, &#187; 100 &#956;M), two glioma&#8208;derived non&#8208;stem cell lines [U87 (IC50, 47 &#956;M) and U251 (IC50, 75 &#956;M)], and two non&#8208;glioma cancer cell lines [HeLa (IC50, &#187; 100 &#956;M) and HEK293 (IC50, &#187; 100 &#956;M)] (Fig 2H). The hypersensitivity of GSCs to PIs was similarly observed when cell viability was measured using trypan blue exclusion assay (Fig 2I). As an alternative measurement, we also determined the efficacy of MG132 to inhibit the self&#8208;renewal of GSCs using in vitro colony formation assays (Fig 2J). MG132 completely inhibited the clonogenic growth of XO8 GSCs at an even lower concentration (IC50, 20 nM). To our knowledge, these IC50 values of GSCs are the lowest compared with those of any other cancer types reported (Fig 2H).</text>

      <text>To determine whether MG132 exerts cytotoxicity to GSCs through proteasomal inhibition, we treated XO8 GSCs and DFCs with various PIs that have differential specificities to the &#946;5, &#946;2, and &#946;1 subunits of the 20S particle. XO8 GSCs showed similar sensitivity to all the tested PIs, including bortezomib (IC50, 40 nM), epoxomicin (IC50, 27 nM), and salinosporamide A (IC50, 29 nM) (Fig 3D). The results were validated using XO6 (IC50, 335 nM) and XO10 (IC50, 79 nM) GSCs independently established from patients with glioma (Fig 3E). Next, we determined whether the cytotoxicity of PIs is influenced by the presence of serum in media during treatment. Even when cultured on the surface in serum&#8208;containing media during MG132 treatment, GSCs showed IC50 values (XO6, 1.4 &#956;M; XO8, 560 nM; XO10, 450 nM) significantly lower than those of DFCs (XO6, &#187; 5 &#956;M; XO8, &#187; 5 &#956;M; XO10, &#187; 5 &#956;M) (Fig 3F). These results suggest that stem cells derived from gliomas are more sensitive to misregulation in the UPS as compared with bulk cancer mass.</text>

      <text>We speculated that GSCs may be hypersensitive to misregulation in proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. Indeed, immunoblotting analysis of Ub conjugates showed that the overall level of ubiquitination was significantly higher in XO8 GSCs as compared with in XO8 DFCs (Fig 4A). To determine whether a dynamic change occurs in ubiquitination during differentiation, we monitored ubiquitination in the course of differentiation. Cellular ubiquitination was highest in XO8 GSCs and gradually downregulated as cell passaging was repeated (Fig 4B). Decreased ubiquitination during differentiation was similarly observed with XO6 GSCs (Fig 4C). In vitro proteasome activity assays using extracts of XO6, XO8, and XO10 GSCs showed that proteasomal model substrates were cleaved faster in GSCs than in non&#8208;stem cells (Fig 4F&#8211;I). Proteasomal activities of the stem cells were higher than those of other non&#8208;stem, non&#8208;glioma cancer cells, such as HeLa and HEK293 (Fig 4F&#8211;I). Immunoblotting and semi&#8208;quantitative RT&#8211;PCR analyses revealed no significant changes between GSCs and DFCs in the numbers of the 26S proteasome and some Ub ligases (Figs 4D and E, and 5A&#8211;D) (note that part of Fig 5C is also shown as the left panel of Fig 4A). These results suggest that the stemness of glioma&#8208;derived stem cells may depend on UPS&#8208;dependent degradation of key regulators.</text>

      <text>To investigate the mechanism by which GSCs are selectively killed by PIs, XO8 GSCs and DFCs were treated with 50 nM MG132 and stained with Annexin V. Immunofluorescence microscopy 17 h post&#8208;treatment revealed that the majority of GSCs, but not DFCs, became Annexin V&#8208;positive (Fig 4J). Flow cytometry showed that the Annexin V&#8208;positive population in MG132&#8208;treated GSCs sharply expanded as early as 6 h (Fig 4K). Immunoblotting analysis confirmed that caspase&#8208;3 and PARP1 were cleaved in 50 nM MG132&#8208;treated XO8 GSCs at 6 and 17 h (Fig 4L). A similar GSC&#8208;specific PARP1 cleavage was observed in XO6 and XO10 GSCs (Fig 4M and N). These results suggest that glioma&#8208;derived stem cells contain an apoptotic switch hypersensitive to proteasomal misregulation as compared with glioma&#8208;derived non&#8208;stem cells or non&#8208;glioma immortalized cell lines.</text>

      <text>The inhibition of NF&#8208;&#954;B has been shown to be a dominating molecular mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects of PIs (typically at 1&#8211;10 &#956;M) in many cancer types 18, 33, 34. However, we observed no significant differences in the levels of the NF&#8208;&#954;B subunits p65 and p50 and the I&#954;B family members (I&#954;B&#8208;&#945;, I&#954;B&#8208;&#946;, and I&#954;B&#8208;&#949;) when GSCs and DFCs were treated with 50 nM MG132 (Fig 5E). This result was further validated with IKK&#8208;&#945; and IKK&#8208;&#946; and their phosphorylated forms that mediate I&#954;B phosphorylation (Fig 5E). Subcellular fractionation retrieved comparable amounts of NF&#8208;&#954;B p65 and p50 subunits from the nucleus (Fig 5F). These results suggest that stem cells derived from gliomas operate an NF&#8208;&#954;B&#8208;independent apoptotic circuit which is turned on under 50 nM MG132.</text>

      <text>Recent studies showed that p38 and c&#8208;Jun N&#8208;terminal kinase (JNK) of the mitogen&#8208;activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway underlie the therapeutic efficacy of 1&#8211;10 &#956;M PIs in lung cancer, glioblastoma, and multiple myeloma 20, 35. Immunoblotting analyses showed that GSCs treated with 50 nM MG132 strongly induced JNK phosphorylation at 6 h post&#8208;treatment, followed by p38 phosphorylation at 17 h (Fig 5G). By contrast, no significant phosphorylation of p38 or JNK was detected in XO8 DFCs under the same conditions (Fig 5G). We then compared the role of JNK and p38 in GSC&#8208;specific apoptosis when treated with 50 nM MG132. Cytotoxicity assays showed that GSC&#8208;specific apoptosis was significantly inhibited by the JNK1/2 inhibitor SP600129 (Fig 5I) but not by the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (Fig 5H). Immunoblotting assays confirmed that the JNK inhibitor abolished JNK phosphorylation as well as PARP1 cleavage (Fig 5J). These results suggest that GSC&#8208;specific apoptosis is mediated through in part JNK phosphorylation and in part JNK&#8208;independent pathway(s).</text>

      <text>Proteasomal inhibition causes the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, triggering the UPR 36. During the early phase, the UPR increases the synthesis of folding factors to enhance folding capacity and halts protein synthesis to reduce ER loading. However, if proteasomal inhibition prolongs, the UPR triggers so&#8208;called ER stress&#8208;associated apoptosis 36. Notably, our microarray analysis revealed a strong transcriptional induction of UPR core components (e.g., BiP, XBP1, and ATF4) as well as ER stress&#8208;associated proapoptotic proteins specifically in GSCs treated with 50 nM MG132 for 6 and 17 h (Appendix Tables S2&#8211;S5). These proapoptotic proteins include ATF3, CHOP, DDIT4, HERPUD1, GADD34, TRIB3, NOXA, and DNAJB1, all of which are known to be induced during the late&#8208;phase UPR. The induction of ER&#8208;associated proapoptotic proteins was reproduced using semi&#8208;quantitative PCR (Fig 6A and B) and immunoblotting (Fig 6C and D) analyses.</text>

      <text>It is known that the proapoptotic transcription factor ATF3 is transcriptionally induced by the PERK&#8208;eIF2&#945;&#8208;ATF4 pathway during the late UPR 37, 38. When GSCs and DFCs were treated with 50 nM MG132, the mRNA level of ATF3 increased 31&#8208;folds in GSCs (Fig 6B, and Appendix Tables S2 and S4), which correlated with the increased protein level of ATF3 (Fig 6C and D). The treatment of actinomycin D, a transcriptional inhibitor, abolished such an induction of ATF3 mRNA in PI&#8208;treated GSCs, suggesting that this induction is largely transcriptional (Fig 6E). The induction of ATF3 is specific to GSCs as no such induction was observed in DFCs under the same conditions. To test the role of ATF3 in apoptosis of GSCs, we knocked down ATF3 using lentiviral shRNA in GSCs treated with 50 nM MG132. ATF3 shRNA #5 and #6 showed high knockdown efficiency and, thus, strongly inhibited the cleavage of PARP1 and caspase&#8208;3 in GSCs (Fig 7A and B). By contrast, shRNA #1 showed poor knockdown and barely inhibited such cleavages (Fig 7A and B). Thus, ATF3 mediates apoptosis selectively in glioma&#8208;derived stem cells under proteasomal inhibition.</text>

      <text>Transcriptionally induced ATF3 during the late UPR is known to form a dimer with CHOP to mediate apoptosis 38. Consistently, we found that the mRNA and protein levels of CHOP were commonly induced in GSCs but not DFCs (Appendix Tables S2 and S4). Moreover, knockdown of CHOP in XO8 GSCs resulted in the loss of hypersensitivity to 50 nM MG132 (Fig 7C), which correlated to decreases in the cleavage of PARP and the level of ATF3 (Fig 7D). A similar result was observed with CHOP&#8722;/&#8722; mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) relative to wild&#8208;type MEFs (Fig 7E and F). These results suggest that ATF3 may function as a dimer with CHOP to mediate apoptosis in GSCs.</text>

      <text>The transcriptional targets of ATF3 include the BH3&#8208;only protein NOXA, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl&#8208;2 family 39. NOXA has been shown to inhibit Bcl&#8208;2, activating Bax/Bak&#8208;mediated mitochondrial release of cytochrome C 39. Consistently, we found that NOXA is co&#8208;induced with ATF3 and CHOP (Appendix Table S5). Moreover, RNA interference assay of ATF3 showed that the levels of ATF3 and NOXA correlate with each other in 50 nM MG132&#8208;treated GSCs (Fig 7G). These results suggest that ATF3 is a key regulator that mediates apoptosis in glioma&#8208;derived stem cells under proteasomal inhibition.</text>

      <text>To determine whether the UPR does indeed trigger apoptosis in PI&#8208;treated GSCs, we compared which of the two events first occurs at 6 and 17 h post&#8208;50 nM MG132 treatment. It is expected that UPR&#8208;associated apoptosis occurs during the late UPR. Surprisingly, a strong induction of proapoptotic proteins was obvious as early as 6 h, that is, earlier than that of the UPR whose induction became obvious at 17 h as compared with 6 h (Fig 6A and B). Immunoblotting analyses after 6 h confirmed marked induction of proapoptotic proteins (e.g., ATF3 and CHOP) but not UPR markers (e.g., XBP1, ATF4, and BiP) (Fig 6C). These results suggest that the apoptosis in PI&#8208;treated GSCs is non&#8208;canonical in that it occurs earlier than the UPR.</text>

      <text>The UPR induces apoptosis through the PERK&#8208;eIF2&#945;&#8208;ATF4&#8208;CHOP pathway 40, 41, 42, 43. To confirm that apoptosis observed in PI&#8208;treated GSCs is not caused by ER stress, we employed chemical inhibitors known to uncouple the UPR from apoptosis. Salubrinal selectively inhibits UPR&#8208;driven apoptosis by constitutively phosphorylating eIF2&#945; 44. If apoptosis in GSCs requires the UPR, salubrinal would block apoptosis in GSCs. Unexpectedly, the result showed that salubrinal did not inhibit apoptosis in 20 nM MG132&#8208;treated GSCs. Moreover, salubrinal exerted an opposite effect, that is, rendered GSCs more sensitive to 20 nM MG132 as determined by the cleavage of PARP1 and caspase&#8208;3 as well as the levels of ATF3 and CHOP (Fig 7I). To confirm this result, we disconnected the UPR from apoptosis using STK047915 which selectively inhibits the IRE1&#8208;ASK1&#8208;JNK pathway. Similar to salubrinal, STK047915 also exhibited a powerful synergy with 20 nM MG132 in inducing apoptosis in GSCs (Fig 7H). Yet another inhibitor of UPR&#8208;driven apoptosis, STK064652, also exerted a similar synergy with 20 nM MG132 (Fig 7H). Semi&#8208;quantitative PCR analyses confirmed that these inhibitors of ER&#8208;associated apoptosis increased the mRNA level of NOXA in GSCs treated with 50 nM MG132 (Fig 7C). These results suggest that the early UPR protects GSCs from the cytotoxicity of PIs and that low&#8208;dosage PIs kill GSCS through a previously unknown, non&#8208;canonical ER stress&#8208;associated apoptosis, which does not require the UPR. Based on these results, we propose that PIs and UPR blockers may be used for combination treatments for gliomas.</text>

Consistently with our in vitro data, the single treatment of MG132 (1 mg/kg) or STK047915 (10 mg/kg) significantly decreased the tumor growth (Fig 8A&#8211;E). Importantly, a combination of STK047915 and MG132 almost completely blocked tumor formation (Fig 8A&#8211;E), indicating a synergistic effect between the two compounds.</text>

      <text>A key factor in low&#8208;dosage proteasome inhibition and its selective efficacy against GSCs lies in the sustained accumulation of ubiquitinated conjugates due to the failure of the proteasome (red cross). The resulting proteotoxicity then can activate the apoptotic cascade, among which genes such as ATF3, CHOP, and JNK are upregulated and translated into their respective protein counterparts. ATF3 and CHOP also form a heterodimer which serves to maintain the apoptotic cascade. The ATF3&#8208;CHOP axis&#8208;induced cell death is independent of classical ER stress&#8208;associated apoptosis and may instead directly play a role via NOXA to induce mitochondrial dysfunction (yellow lightning) and eventually cell death.</text>

      <text>In this study, we demonstrated that PIs selectively kill GSCs (IC50, 27&#8211;70 nM) relative to their DFCs (IC50, &#187; 100 &#956;M). Based on its therapeutic efficacy on cultured cells, bortezomib has been exploited to treat glioblastoma in a phase I clinical trial as a single agent and in a phase II trial in combination with a HDAC inhibitor 45, 46. Unfortunately, these clinical trials failed because of low response rates on recurrent glioblastoma. Given our results indicating the hypersensitivity of GSCs to PIs, one possible explanation for this failure is that bortezomib conferred cytotoxicity only to GSCs but not to the tumor bulk, which would not apparently affect total tumor masses. In fact, our results (Fig 2) suggest that more differentiated cells, which comprise of the bulk mass in tumors, are approximately 1,000&#8208;fold more resistant to PIs. As already suggested by others 47, some differentiated cells that survive PI treatment may acquire stem cell properties through de&#8208;differentiation. Another explanation for the failure in these clinical trials is that bortezomib may not efficiently cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB). Thus, maximal therapeutic efficacy may be achieved once a BBB&#8208;penetrating PI is developed to kill GSCs in combination with other antitumor reagents targeting differentiated tumor cells.</text>

      <text>Our results show that the levels of cellular ubiquitination and proteasomal activities in GSCs are markedly higher compared with their DFCs and are gradually downregulated through the course of differentiation (Fig 4B, C and F), indicating that the genomewide program in the UPS is subjected to dynamic changes during the maintenance of stemness in GSCs and their differentiation process. Also, recent genomic analyses to describe cancer&#8208;associated genetic abnormalities using 72 cancer cell lines showed that genes associated with UPS are a point of vulnerability in many cancer cells 48. Relevant to this speculation, a previous quantitative mass spectrometric study on the role of the UPS in pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) showed that a significant number of proteins involved in the maintenance of stemness are ubiquitinated and actively degraded in ESCs compared with their DFCs 49. In another study, a screening of 312 ligases ended up with 17 Ub ligases whose knockdown resulted in apoptotic death of cancer cell lines 23. Notably, knockdown of these 17 Ub ligases in glioblastoma stem cells induced differentiation associated with death or hypersensitivity to stressors 23. These results together suggest that the apoptotic machinery in GSCs is highly sensitive to subtle misregulation in the timely degradation of key molecules, readily triggering programmed cell death in GSCs (Fig 9).</text>

      <text>Studies have shown that the cytotoxicity caused by PIs is mainly associated with enhanced apoptosis 50, 51. The apoptotic effects of PIs at 1&#8211;10 &#956;M have been attributed to the failure to degrade I&#954;B and the consequential inhibition of NF&#8208;&#954;B activation. 18, 33, 34. Our results show that PIs at 20&#8211;70 nM do not significantly affect the functions of NF&#8208;&#954;B and I&#954;B as well as IKK, predicting the presence of an NF&#8208;&#954;B&#8208;independent apoptotic pathway. One proapoptotic mediator that we found links PI&#8208;generated death signals to apoptotic core machinery is JNK, but not p38, of the MAPK pathway 20, 35, 52. Intriguingly, we found that the JNK pathway is responsible for only part of the apoptotic death of GSCs because a small&#8208;molecule inhibitor of JNK significantly, but only partially, protects GSCs from the cytotoxicity of PIs. This leakiness of JNK inhibitors can be explained by our finding that 50 nM MG132 strongly induces an ER&#8208;associated apoptotic pathway (Appendix Tables S4 and S5, and Fig 6). Among these, the proapoptotic transcription factor ATF3 is likely to function as a key signaling mediator underlying the hypersensitivity of GSCs to proteasomal inhibition. This proposition is supported by the following results. First, our microarray analyses identified ATF3 to be the most prominent hit, with an mRNA level ~30.9&#8208;fold induced in 50 nM MG132&#8208;treated GSCs (Appendix Tables S2 and S4). Second, knockdown of ATF3 using RNA interference assay markedly inhibited the cleavage of PI&#8208;induced apoptosis in GSCs, but not in DFCs (Fig 7A and B). Third, the induction of ATF3 and CHOP temporally correlated with each other during PI treatment of GSCs. Consistent with these results are the findings by others that ATF3 is activated by PERK&#8208;eIF2&#945;&#8208;ATF4 during prolonged ER stress and transfers death signals from stressed ER to the mitochondrial apoptotic machinery 37, 38.</text>

      <text>Studies have shown that ATF3 forms a dimer with CHOP to induce the expression of genes involved in the stress responses and apoptosis 53. Consistently, our results show that ATF3 is co&#8208;induced with CHOP during apoptosis in GSCs treated with 50 nM MG132 (Fig 6C) and that CHOP is required for PI&#8208;induced selective apoptosis of GSCs (Fig 7C&#8211;F). Although it remains to be determined whether ATF3 directly interacts with CHOP in PI&#8208;treated GSCs, ATF3 may work with CHOP to mediate PI&#8208;induced apoptosis in GSCs. Another question concerning the identity of the downstream signaling molecule of ATF3 remains to be addressed. Our results suggest that ATF3 is transcriptionally co&#8208;induced with NOXA during apoptosis in 50 nM MG132&#8208;treated GSCs (Appendix Tables S2 and S4, and Fig 6B) and that ATF3&#8208;knockdown downregulates the level of NOXA mRNA in MG132&#8208;treated GSCs (Fig 7G). We suggest that the transcriptional activation of NOXA by ATF3 may be a mechanism underlying the hypersensitivity of GSCs to PIs.</text>

      <text>The UPR is triggered by accumulating misfolded proteins in the ER lumen and attempts to restore homeostasis. There is a general notion that ER stress&#8208;induced apoptosis is triggered by terminal UPR when early UPR fails to restore ER functions 36, 54. Recent study showed that ER stress&#8208;induced UPR in colon cancer stem cells induces differentiation which enhances the sensitivity to chemotherapy 55. Our microarray analyses also show the transcriptional induction of the UPR and proapoptotic genes associated with ER stress in GSCs treated with 50 nM MG132. Surprisingly, we found that so&#8208;called ER stress&#8208;associated apoptosis in 50 nM MG132&#8208;treated GSCs is not a consequence of failed UPR but is directly triggered, possibly on the cytosolic surface of the ER membrane, by unknown signals from the troubled cytosol in which proteasomal degradation of key molecules is impaired. Thus, apoptosis observed in 50 nM MG132&#8208;treated GSCs is mechanistically different from ER stress&#8208;associated apoptosis in other cancer cell types. Is the ER&#8208;associated apoptosis in PI&#8208;treated GSCs then functionally independent from the UPR? If the apoptosis is dependent on the UPR, the inhibition of UPR&#8208;mediated apoptosis will rescue GSCs from the cytotoxicity of PIs. Surprisingly, we found that pharmacological inhibition of UPR&#8208;mediated apoptosis is synergistic with 20 nM MG132 in killing GSCs, suggesting that the UPR, at least its early phase, plays a protective role in GSCs treated with PIs. Given the synergistic cytotoxic activity observed in this study, PIs and inhibitors of ER stress&#8208;induced apoptosis may provide a means for a combination treatment for gliomas (see Fig 9). Indeed, we confirmed that a combinational treatment of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and UPR blocker STK047915 synergistically inhibited the tumor formation of GSCs in mice (Fig 8).</text>

The cells in Diluent C were mixed with an equal volume of Diluent C containing 4 &#956;M of each fluorescent dye, followed by incubation for 5 min at room temperature. After the labeling reaction was stopped by adding serum&#8208;containing growth media, the cells were washed twice and resuspended in serum&#8208;free media. Equal volumes of green&#8208;labeled GSCs and red&#8208;labeled DFCs were mixed with each other. The mixture of GSCs and DFCs was cultured for 8 h in serum&#8208;free media supplemented with laminin (20 &#956;g/ml) on plates or coverslips, followed by incubation with DMSO or 50 nM MG132 for 17 h.</text>

      <text>The tumorigenic potential of XO8 GSCs was compared to that of DFCs by in vivo tumorigenicity titration. Animal studies were conducted according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH publication no. 85&#8208;23, revised in 1996) and the protocols (12&#8208;0304) approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Seoul National University. XO8 GSCs or DFCs were resuspended in 3 &#956;l of Dulbecco's PBS and injected stereotactically into the striatum of BALB/c nude mice via stereotactic device (coordinates: 1 mm anterior, 2 mm lateral to the bregma, 3 mm depth). The injection procedure caused no lethality in the animals. After 6 weeks, the mice were sacrificed at the onset of neurological symptoms for the analysis of tumor histology and immunohistochemistry. Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg Zoletil (Virbac) and 10 mg/kg xylazine (Bayer). Brains were harvested by cardiac perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde and further fixed at 4&#176;C overnight. After fixation, the brains were dehydrated using sucrose and embedded in optimum cutting temperature compound (Tissue&#8208;Tek) and stored at &#8722;80&#176;C. The brains were sectioned using a cryostat into 10&#8208;&#956;m slices and stained with hematoxylin and eosin using standard protocols. Bright&#8208;field images were acquired using a microscope (BX21; Olympus).</text>

      <text>All animal procedures were carried out in accordance with animal care guidelines approved by the Korea University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Five&#8208;week&#8208;old female BALB/c nude mice were obtained from the Shizuoka Laboratory Animal Center (Shizuoka, Japan) and housed in a specific pathogen&#8208;free environment. All surgery was performed under Zoletil&#174; 50/xylazine anesthesia, and animal suffering was minimized. For the brain orthotopic model, XO8 GSCs were resuspended in sterile PBS at a density of 3 &#215; 106 cells/ml, and 30,000 cells were stereotactically implanted in the right cerebral cortices of nude mice. For the xenograft model, XO10 GSCs stably infected with a luciferase expression vector were likewise resuspended in sterile PBS at a density of 3 &#215; 106 cells/ml, among which 30,000 cells were injected subcutaneously in the right flank of mice. One week after implantation, animals received 50 mg/kg d&#8208;luciferin to verify tumor implantation via luciferase bioluminescence (NightOwl LB 981 Molecular Imaging System; Berthold Technologies) in vivo imaging system. After a few weeks when tumor volume had reached approximately 180 mm3, mice were randomized into four drug treatment groups: control (n = 5), STK047915 (n = 5), MG132 (n = 5), and STK047915 + MG132 (n = 5). The mice were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 10 mg/kg STK047915, 1 mg/kg MG132, or in combination daily for 14 days. Tumor volume was calculated every 2 days for 21 days according to the following equation: tumor volume (mm3) = &#960;/6 &#215; length &#215; (width)2. Maximum tumor area and its corresponding section were calculated via MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices).</text>

      <text>Total RNAs were extracted from cells treated with 50 nM MG132 for 17 h in serum&#8208;free media by RNeasy&#174; Plus kit (Qiagen). Microarray analysis was performed using the Illumina HumanHT&#8208;12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina Inc.). Isolated RNAs were labeled with biotin and the biotinylated cRNAs were prepared from 0.55 g total RNA using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion). After fragmentation, 0.75 g of cRNAs was hybridized to the Illumina HumanHT&#8208;12 Expression Beadchip according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Illumina GenomeStudio v2009.2 (Gene Expression Module v1.5.4) was used to array data export processing and analysis. The data in GEOArchive files were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) of NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under the accession number of GSE62356. Only the probes that fulfill the criteria in which the detection probability value (pval) is lower than 0.05 were analyzed. Quantile normalization was applied for normalization of gene expression value. The correlation coefficient between the log fold change of raw data and that after quantile normalization was 0.996 for GSCs and 0.980 for differentiated cells, suggesting the value was adjusted without significant loss from raw data. All probe intensities conformed to the same distribution for all sample arrays through the quantile normalization. Fold change (FC) was calculated by comparing the expression in the DMSO&#8208;treated cells with that in the MG132&#8208;treated cells.</text>
