      <text>Cross&#8208;presentation by MHC class I molecules allows the detection of exogenous antigens by CD8+ T lymphocytes. This process is crucial to initiate cytotoxic immune responses against many pathogens (i.e., Toxoplasma gondii) and tumors. To achieve efficient cross&#8208;presentation, dendritic cells (DCs) have specialized endocytic pathways; however, the molecular effectors involved are poorly understood. In this work, we identify the small GTPase Rab22a as a key regulator of MHC&#8208;I trafficking and antigen cross&#8208;presentation by DCs. Our results demonstrate that Rab22a is recruited to DC endosomes and phagosomes, as well as to the vacuole containing T. gondii parasites. The silencing of Rab22a expression did not affect the uptake of exogenous antigens or parasite invasion, but it drastically reduced the intracellular pool and the recycling of MHC&#8208;I molecules. The knockdown of Rab22a also hampered the cross&#8208;presentation of soluble, particulate and T. gondii&#8208;associated antigens, but not the endogenous MHC&#8208;I antigen presentation through the classical secretory pathway. Our findings provide compelling evidence that Rab22a plays a central role in the MHC&#8208;I endocytic trafficking, which is crucial for efficient cross&#8208;presentation by DCs.</text>

      <text>Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent antigen&#8208;presenting cells capable of initiating adaptive immune responses. These cells process and present antigens in the context of class I or class II molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) to trigger CD8+ or CD4+ T&#8208;cell activation, respectively. Antigens presented by MHC&#8208;I can be either endogenous or exogenous. The former antigen presentation scenario is referred to as the &#8220;classical pathway&#8221; and the latter as &#8220;cross&#8208;presentation&#8221;. Cross&#8208;presentation is pivotal to establish CD8+ cytotoxic immune responses against tumors and several pathogens, including the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii1. Compared to other professional phagocytes, DCs have developed highly specialized mechanisms of internalization to achieve an efficient cross&#8208;presentation 2. Indeed, the acidification of the phagosomal content of DCs has proved to be a very slow process due to the production of reactive oxygen species by the NADPH oxidase NOX2 3 and to an incomplete activation of the V&#8208;ATPase 4. The combination of a high pH and low levels of lysosomal proteases limits the proteolytic activity in DC phagosomes 5. This limited phagosomal proteolysis may leave intact proteins or large polypeptides for export to the cytosol, most likely via a Sec61&#8208;dependent mechanism 6, for further degradation by the proteasome. Then, the processed peptides are translocated by TAP1/2 transporters into the lumen of the ER or back into phagosomes, since these organelles recruit components from the ER&#8211;Golgi intermediate compartment by the action of the SNARE Sec22b 7. The translocated peptides are trimmed by ER aminopeptidases 8 and their analogues, such as IRAP 9, prior to loading on MHC&#8208;I molecules by the peptide loading complex 10. Finally, the MHC&#8208;I/peptide complexes are transported to the cell surface in order to trigger CD8+ T&#8208;cell activation.</text>

      <text>Although some major advances in the understanding of MHC&#8208;I intracellular trafficking during cross&#8208;presentation have recently been made, in particular those regarding the importance of Rab11a and endosomal recycling compartments (ERC) 11, the molecular effectors of the endocytic network that regulate MHC&#8208;I presentation remain poorly understood. Even less understood are the interactions that the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) of T. gondii establishes with the endocytic and exocytic pathways to intercept MHC&#8208;I molecules for efficient CD8+ T&#8208;cell activation during DC infection 12. In this study, we focused on the small GTPase Rab22a, which is a molecule that modulates central aspects of MHC&#8208;I and CD1a endocytic recycling 13, 14. Rab proteins mediate most intracellular membrane trafficking events by cycling between an active GTP&#8208;bound state and an inactive GDP&#8208;bound state. Working as molecular switches, different Rabs associate with specific membrane compartments giving a unique surface identity, which is required for the recruitment of molecules involved in targeting specificity 15. Rab22a has been described in early and late endosomes, but not in lysosomes in CHO cells 16. Rab22a also controls the transport of the transferrin receptor (TfR) from sorting to recycling endosomes 17, and it is associated with tubular recycling intermediates containing MHC&#8208;I molecules and transferrin 13. In the latter work, the authors have also suggested that the activation of Rab22a is required for tubule formation, while the inactive state of Rab22a is necessary for the final fusion of these tubules derived from recycling compartments with the plasma membrane 13. Moreover, Rab22a participates in the phagosome/vacuole physiology during infection and the intracellular trafficking of several pathogens, such as Anaplasma phagocytophilum18, Neisseria meningitidis19, Borrelia burgdorferi20 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis21. Nevertheless, although this Rab&#8208;GTPase plays important roles in the endocytic pathway by modulating endosomal and phagosomal functions, its role in DCs remains unknown.</text>

      <text>In this work, we demonstrate that Rab22a is widely distributed in the endocytic network of DCs and that it is early recruited to endosomes and phagosomes, as well as to the T. gondii PV, a parasite&#8208;modified compartment known to be distinct from a phagosome in infected DCs. We demonstrate that Rab22a controls MHC&#8208;I intracellular distribution, recycling and trafficking to DC phagosomes. The silencing of Rab22a expression in DCs impacts on the ability of these cells to achieve an efficient cross&#8208;presentation of soluble and particulate exogenous antigens, as well as T. gondii&#8208;derived soluble antigens. We conclude that Rab22a plays an essential role in MHC&#8208;I endocytic trafficking during antigen cross&#8208;presentation by DCs.</text>

      <text>It is known that Rab22a regulates the intracellular transport of MHC&#8208;I and TfR in several cell lines 13, 14, 17. Thus, it was interesting to assess the localization of this protein in the endocytic pathway of DCs. By immunofluorescence (IF), we analyzed the colocalization of endogenous Rab22a with three endocytic markers (EEA1 for early endosomes, Lamp1 for late endosomes/lysosomes, and TfR for recycling compartments) in mouse bone marrow&#8208;derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). Rab22a was present in the three compartments; however, in contrast to previous reports, the Pearson correlation coefficient (Pcc) determined for Lamp1 was markedly high (0.8412), suggesting that in DCs, Rab22a was present not only in early endosomes (Pcc, 0.4317 for EEA1) but also in late endocytic compartments (Fig 1A, upper and middle panels). Rab22a was also present in recycling compartments as indicated by a high localization with the TfR (Pcc, 0.6409; Fig 1A, lower panel). The presence of Rab22a in the recycling center was confirmed by co&#8208;staining with Rab11a, a GTPase that is specific for this compartment (Fig EV1A). In summary, our results indicate that Rab22a has a ubiquitous distribution in the endocytic and recycling compartments of DCs.</text>

      <text>The recruitment of Rab22a to compartments containing soluble and particulate exogenous antigens was then explored. We observed that many early endosomes, as labeled with the EEA1 marker, were positive for Rab22a and internalized soluble fluorescent ovalbumin (OVA) after 30 min of uptake (Fig 1B). When BMDCs were fed during 1 h with 3&#8208;&#956;m latex beads (LB), a clear recruitment of Rab22a and Lamp1 was observed around LB phagosomes (Fig 1C). To confirm these observations, the presence of Rab22a in purified BMDC phagosomes was assessed by Western blot. As expected, an increase in Lamp1 over time was observed, whereas Rab22a was recruited as soon as 15 min after internalization and remained in the phagosomes for up to 60 min (Fig 1D). Similar results were obtained with the JAWS&#8208;II DC line, where Rab22a was detected in purified phagosomes at 15 min after internalization and decreased at 60 min (Fig EV1B). These observations were confirmed through the quantification of Rab22a levels in isolated phagosomes by flow cytometry (Fig EV1C). Altogether, these experiments demonstrate that Rab22a is distributed widely in the endocytic pathway of DCs and that it is early and efficiently recruited to endosomes and phagosomes containing internalized material.</text>

      <text>The localization of Rab22a in other cell types is mainly restricted to early, late, and recycling endosomes, but it is excluded from other compartments with higher proteolytic capacity, such as lysosomes 16. Intriguingly, the location of Rab22a in DCs seems to be slightly different. Indeed, this GTPase was found to be more abundant in recycling endosomes and late endosomes/lysosomes. It can be hypothesized that this difference in Rab22a location, with a wider distribution along the endocytic pathway of DCs, is important for the interception of exogenous antigens after their internalization.</text>

      <text>To assess the role of Rab22a in the endocytic pathway of DCs, we generated stable knockdown JAWS&#8208;II DCs (Rab22a KD cells) by means of lentivirus&#8208;delivered short hairpin RNAs (shRNA). As shown in the immunoblot of Fig 2A, the expression of Rab22a was lowered to 40% as compared to DCs transduced with the scramble shRNA used as control (Scramble cells). This level of KD efficiency was confirmed by RNA extraction and qPCR (Fig 2B). Despite this modest KD efficacy, we observed a drastic effect on the intracellular distribution of MHC&#8208;I molecules, as shown by IF detection and confocal microscopy. In particular, we noticed the disappearance of the perinuclear MHC&#8208;I pool corresponding to the recycling center that markedly colocalized with Rab22a in Scramble DCs (Fig 2C). In contrast, the plasma membrane&#8208;associated labeling did not seem to be affected (Fig 2C). This alteration in MHC&#8208;I distribution was then assessed by flow cytometry. MHC&#8208;I molecules exposed on the plasma membrane were labeled with a FITC&#8208;conjugated anti&#8208;H&#8208;2Kb&#8208;specific antibody in non&#8208;permeabilized cells, while the internal pool was labeled after cell fixation and permeabilization with saponin. As depicted in Figs 2D and EV2A, the amount of MHC&#8208;I expressed on the cell surface did not exhibit significant differences between KD and control cells. In contrast, the total amount of MHC&#8208;I (cell surface + intracellular pool) was strongly decreased in the Rab22a KD DCs. To confirm these results, we performed this set of experiments also with primary BMDCs. We silenced the expression of Rab22a and we observed, by confocal microscopy (Fig EV2B) and by flow cytometry (Fig EV2C and D), a clear disappearance of the MHC&#8208;I intracellular pool, while the amount of MHC&#8208;I present at the cell surface remained unchanged, as compared to Scramble BMDCs. Therefore, it can be assumed that the reduction in the expression of Rab22a causes an important decrease in the intracellular pool of MHC&#8208;I molecules in both, JAWS&#8208;II DCs and BMDCs.</text>

      <text>The remarkable changes observed in the intracellular pool of MHC&#8208;I molecules prompted us to investigate whether Rab22a was controlling the acquisition of MHC&#8208;I molecules to DC phagosomes, a process already described for Rab11a KD DCs 11. To address this issue, we isolated LB&#8208;containing phagosomes from Scramble and Rab22a KD JAWS&#8208;II DCs at 15 min, 1, 3, and 5 h post&#8208;internalization and we analyzed the presence of MHC&#8208;I by flow cytometry (Fig EV2E). A striking impairment in the phagosomal recruitment of MHC&#8208;I molecules was observed in Rab22a KD DCs, as compared to Scramble DCs (Figs 2E and EV2F). Interestingly, results showed the existence of two different kinetics for both cell types: while in Scramble DCs, phagosomal MHC&#8208;I labeling decreased after 3 h post&#8208;internalization, in Rab22a KD DCs, the staining was lower but sustained over time (Fig 2E), indicating that Rab22a may also be playing an important role during MHC&#8208;I molecules export from the phagosome to the cell surface. To confirm the defect of MHC&#8208;I phagosomal acquisition after the silencing of Rab22a, we isolated phagosomes at 3 h post&#8208;internalization from primary transduced BMDCs. Again, the flow cytometric analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in MHC&#8208;I molecules in Rab22a KD BMDC phagosomes, as compared to Scramble cells (Fig EV2G). Our results demonstrate that Rab22a has a crucial role in the regulation of the MHC&#8208;I phagosomal recruitment by DCs.</text>

      <text>Although previous studies carried out in other cell types have demonstrated that Rab22a controls the recycling of MHC&#8208;I molecules, data regarding the role of this GTPase in the fast recycling of TfR are controversial 13, 17. Therefore, these aspects of the endocytic trafficking were assessed herein. We evaluated the MHC&#8208;I and TfR recycling capacities of Scramble and Rab22a KD JAWS&#8208;II DCs by flow cytometry. Thus, the decrease in the mean fluorescent intensities (MFI) of FITC&#8208;conjugated H&#8208;2Kb, and Alexa 488&#8208;conjugated transferrin were measured in order to assess the efficiency of molecular recycling to the plasma membrane after binding, internalization, and cell surface acid stripping. Interestingly, in Rab22a KD DCs, we observed a significant recycling capacity inhibition for MHC&#8208;I (Figs 2F and EV2H), but not for TfR (Figs 2G and EV2I), as compared to Scramble DCs.</text>

      <text>Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that Rab22a is crucial to stabilize the intracellular pool of MHC&#8208;I molecules at the ERC, where it colocalizes with Rab11a and TfR. Moreover, we observed that Rab22a is necessary for the normal recruitment of MHC&#8208;I molecules to DC phagosomes. In this sense, it is worth mentioning that the acquisition kinetics of MHC&#8208;I to Scramble DC phagosomes is in accordance with the phagosomal recruitment and subsequent disappearance of Rab22a. The role of Rab22a in MHC&#8208;I molecules recycling has been already described by others 13, 14; however, the modulatory capacity of this small GTPase has never been addressed in immune cells. In our study, a severe defect of MHC&#8208;I molecules recycling by Rab22a KD DCs was observed. Interestingly, the fast recycling, as evaluated by the use of fluorescent&#8208;labeled transferrin, is not altered in these cells.</text>

      <text>Since Rab22a impacted on the intracellular trafficking of MHC&#8208;I molecules to DC phagosomes, we analyzed the effect of Rab22a silencing on antigen cross&#8208;presentation. Scramble and Rab22a KD JAWS&#8208;II DCs were fed with soluble OVA or OVA&#8208;coated beads during 5 h. Then, DCs were extensively washed, fixed, and incubated with the &#946;&#8208;galactosidase&#8208;inducible B3Z T&#8208;cell hybrid, which is specific for the OVA peptide (SIINFEKL) in association with H&#8208;2Kb MHC&#8208;I molecules. A strong inhibition of the cross&#8208;presentation capacity for soluble OVA and OVA&#8208;coated LB in Rab22a KD DCs was observed, as compared to Scramble DCs (Fig 3A and B, respectively). The synthetic peptide SIINFEKL, which does not need further processing in intracellular compartments, was presented equally well in both DC types (Fig 3C), demonstrating that the impairment of cross&#8208;presentation in Rab22a KD DCs was due to a defect in endosomal and phagosomal uptake and/or antigen processing.</text>

      <text>Whether the reduced cross&#8208;presentation ability of Rab22a KD JAWS&#8208;II DCs could be due to a defect in antigen uptake was then evaluated. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the endocytosis of FITC&#8208;coupled soluble OVA by FACS. No significant differences between both cell types were observed regarding such endocytic capacity (Figs 3D and EV3A). In order to assess whether these findings were due to a defect on phagocytosis, DCs were incubated with 3&#8208;&#956;m fluorescent LB coated with OVA. After different internalization time periods, LB associated with the cell surface were labeled with an anti&#8208;OVA antibody. With this experimental approach, we could differentiate between surface&#8208;associated and fully internalized beads. When only completely phagocytosed particles were considered, no significant differences in phagocytosis between both DC types were observed (Fig 3E). Since Rab22a has previously been found to be involved in the modulation of phagosome maturation 21, we investigated if Rab22a is also playing a role in this function in DCs. To this end, we analyzed the phagosomal degradation of OVA (the same antigen used to assess cross&#8208;presentation) by FACS, as described previously 7. OVA&#8208;coated LB were internalized during 15 min, 1 h, and 3 h by Scramble and Rab22a KD JAWS&#8208;II DCs. Then, the isolated phagosomes were stained for OVA and the amount of intact and degraded antigen was determined. As depicted in Figs 3F and EV3B, Rab22a KD DCs exhibited a similar phagosomal degradation capacity, as compared to Scramble DCs. Indeed, we observed that antigen phagosomal degradation was slow and unaggressive, a specialization of DC phagosomes that has been extensively documented 3, 4. These results indicate that neither antigen uptake nor antigen processing is affected by the silencing of Rab22a in DCs.</text>

      <text>To confirm the role of Rab22a in antigen cross&#8208;presentation in primary DCs, we transduced BMDCs transiently with two different shRNAs to achieve Rab22a silencing (Rab22a KD #1 and #2) and with the control shRNA (Scramble). In this case, and differently from our stable Rab22a KD DC line, we obtained an almost complete depletion of the protein for both BMDCs lentiviral treatments (Fig 3G). Accordingly, the impact on soluble OVA cross&#8208;presentation was much more drastic in these cells, as compared to Scramble BMDCs (Fig 3H). As before, Rab22a KD BMDCs did not exhibit any defect in the control peptide presentation (Fig 3I). To assess whether Rab22a silencing induced an alteration on BMDC maturation, we labeled LPS&#8208;treated and non&#8208;treated transduced BMDCs, and we analyzed by FACS the cell surface expression of different activation/maturation markers: CD80, CD86, and MHC&#8208;II molecules. No significant differences in the expression of these markers or in the percentages of CD11c&#8208;positive cells were observed between Scramble and Rab22a KD BMDCs (Fig EV3C).</text>

      <text>The constitutive trafficking of newly synthetized MHC&#8208;I molecules to the plasma membrane depends on the normal functioning of the Golgi apparatus. Besides, the trans&#8208;Golgi network establishes frequent interactions with endosomal recycling vesicles. Hence, we studied if the morphology of the Golgi apparatus was somehow altered in the Rab22a KD DCs. To this end, we performed IF staining and confocal microscopy to evaluate the shape of the cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;Golgi networks by means of the GM130 and TGN46 markers, respectively. No obvious modifications of the two different Golgi markers tested were observed (Fig EV4A and B), suggesting a normal functioning of the secretory pathway for both DC types. To confirm this hypothesis, we tested the endogenous MHC&#8208;I antigen presentation capacity of Rab22a KD DCs (&#8220;classical pathway&#8221;). This type of MHC&#8208;I antigen presentation uses the classical secretory pathway, which can be interrupted by brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of Golgi&#8208;mediated secretion. Briefly, Scramble and Rab22a KD JAWS&#8208;II DCs were pre&#8208;treated or not with BFA during 30 min. After incubation, soluble OVA was electroporated into the cytosol of DCs 22 and cells were incubated for 2 h with or without BFA, fixed, and confronted with CD8+ T cells. As shown in Fig 3J, no significant differences in T&#8208;cell activation were observed between Scramble and Rab22a KD DCs at any condition tested. By Western blot, we also controlled the amount of antigen incorporated by both DC types after the electroporation treatment (Fig 3K). These experiments corroborate the notion that the implication of Rab22a in MHC&#8208;I trafficking only impacts the cross&#8208;presentation pathway.</text>

      <text>Consistent with the effect on MHC&#8208;I trafficking, our results indicate that Rab22a is critical for optimal cross&#8208;presentation of soluble OVA and OVA&#8208;coated LB in DCs. Rab22a does not participate in classical MHC&#8208;I antigen presentation, and its impact is not related to a defect in neither fluid phase endocytosis, phagocytosis, nor antigen phagosomal degradation. Interestingly, in our Rab22a KD DC line, and depending on the antigen concentration, the cross&#8208;presentation inhibition was 40&#8211;60%, a percentage comparable to the percentage of Rab22a silencing in those cells. Stronger inhibitions of cross&#8208;presentation were obtained in Rab22a KD BMDCs, which also exhibit stronger Rab22a silencing. Rab3b/3c&#8208;positive recycling vesicles have already been reported to be involved in antigen cross&#8208;presentation 23. However, the first study that directly showed a crucial role for the ERC during this immunological process is more recent 11. In the latter work, the authors have shown that Rab11a exhibits a very similar role to Rab22a in our study, in terms of MHC&#8208;I intracellular distribution pattern and antigen cross&#8208;presentation. Our results also suggest that the fast recycling pathway could be used to compensate other endocytic functions, such as OVA&#8208;mediated endocytosis, a process not affected in DCs by the silencing of Rab22a. Surprisingly, the phagosomal antigen degradation is not enhanced in Rab22a KD DCs, since it was previously described that Rab22a controls the maturation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis&#8208;containing phagosomes 21. The discrepancies found between the latter work and our results could be due to differences in the models used for both studies, including the cell types (macrophages vs. DCs) and the nature of phagosomes (M. tuberculosis vs. inert LB).</text>

      <text>To study the function of Rab22a in a different context of exogenous antigen presentation, we analyzed DCs infected by the T. gondii, an obligate intracellular parasite that actively shapes and replicates in a specialized parasitophorous vacuole (PV). While the PV is clearly different from a phagolysosome 24, it interacts with, and potentially sequesters, host organelles, such as the ER 25, the Golgi apparatus 26, and lysosomes 27. The PV also shares an important feature of cross&#8208;presenting compartments such as the SNARE Sec22b&#8208;dependent ER recruitment 7, 28, which is decisive for efficient activation of OVA&#8208;specific CD8+ T lymphocytes. During T. gondii infection, overexpression studies suggested that Rab14, Rab30, and Rab43 are recruited to the parasite PV and that they may ensure sphingolipids scavenging from the Golgi 26.</text>

      <text>To investigate whether Rab22a plays a role in the PV&#8208;endocytic compartment communication, we first evaluated if this GTPase was recruited to vacuoles containing YFP&#8208;expressing TgRH parasites after 8&#8208;h infection. As shown in Fig EV5A, BMDCs infected by T. gondii exhibited an impressive recruitment of endogenous Rab22a and most of the intracellular location of this GTPase was redistributed toward the PVs, suggesting that it is involved in the trafficking in and out of the vacuole. Since host ER recruitment and cross&#8208;presentation of T. gondii&#8208;derived antigens are completely dependent on active infection 28, we evaluated whether the Rab22a recruitment to the PV is also conditioned by the infective status of the parasite. To address this issue, the IF assays included a staining for GRA6, a protein secreted by the parasite only upon active infection. By this approach, we could discriminate between infective PVs (GRA6&#8208;positive PV) from phagocytosed parasites (GRA6&#8208;negative PV). Contrary to what we observed during active infection, GRA6&#8208;negative PVs showed a faint Rab22a staining and the intracellular distribution of this protein was not visibly altered (Fig EV5B). This finding is similar to previous results obtained with LB phagosomes (Fig 1C). In summary, &lt; 30% of the GRA6&#8208;negative PVs were Rab22a&#8208;positive, while the percentage of Rab22a/GRA6&#8208;double&#8208;positive PVs was near 80%.</text>

      <text>Next, we studied if GRA6 was equally detected in the PV of Scramble and Rab22a KD JAWS&#8208;II DCs. Indeed, GRA6 was present in both DC types, but a clear Rab22a labeling around PVs was observed only in Scramble DCs (Fig 4A). Hence, defects on Rab22a could influence the presentation of T. gondii&#8208;derived antigens. To test this possibility, we measured presentation of the OVA&#8208;derived SIINFEKL peptide by H&#8208;2Kb on the surface of DCs infected for 8 h with TgRH parasites that express and secrete SAG1&#8208;OVA into the vacuole (TgRH YFP SAG1&#8208;OVA parasites) 29. A dramatic inhibition of OVA cross&#8208;presentation in Rab22a KD DCs was observed, as compared to control cells (Fig 4B). Importantly, FACS analysis showed that both DC types displayed a similar degree of infection regardless of the multiplicity of infection (MOI) employed (Fig 4C), indicating that the defect in B3Z CD8+ T lymphocyte activation was not due to a differential infection rate of Rab22a KD cells. Additionally, we verified that the total amount of parasite&#8208;secreted SAG1&#8208;OVA antigen present in DCs infected at two different MOI and two different times post&#8208;infection was similar between Rab22a KD and Scramble DCs (Fig 4D).</text>

      <text>These observations indicate that Rab22a plays a major role in another cross&#8208;presentation context: the case of soluble T. gondii&#8208;derived antigens secreted into the PV. The T. gondii PV is different from a phagosome as it is actively shaped by parasite secretory proteins during invasion and replication, and it does not fuse with lysosomes 24. Some of these secretory proteins (e.g., GRA6) are natural MHC&#8208;I antigens, whose processing is regulated by their membrane association properties 30. Beyond the soluble OVA model antigen used in this report, it will now be key to study the implication of Rab22a in cross&#8208;presentation of endogenous T. gondii antigens. Intriguingly, we also report a strong recruitment of endogenous Rab22a toward the T. gondii PV exclusively upon active infection, similarly of what accounts for host ER recruitment 28. This phenomenon would suggest that, besides playing a role in antigen presentation, the Rab22a&#8208;dependent recruitment of ERC components could regulate host&#8211;parasite interactions. Remarkably, very few host Rab GTPases have been described to be recruited by the parasite PV. In one recent study, in which overexpression of Rab14, Rab30, or Rab43 was induced in HeLa cells, the three GTPases were present in the vacuole and they were important for sphingolipids scavenging from the Golgi 26. Whether Rab22a may support or restrict parasite growth is an interesting issue to be further addressed. In line with the importance of Rab22a during pathogen invasion, a recent work demonstrates that the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi is phagocytosed and compacted by macrophages in a mechanism coordinated by the action of Rab22a and Rab5, showing that these endosomal GTPases are essential for the processing and elimination of this bacterium 20. Furthermore, the Gram&#8208;negative bacteria Neisseria meningitidis subverts host cell polarization and the intracellular trafficking to cross the epithelial barrier by association with ERC, as the phagosome&#8208;containing this pathogen is positive for several Rab proteins typical of recycling vesicles, such as Rab22a 19.</text>

      <text>The establishment of protective CD8+ T&#8208;cell responses through the cross&#8208;presentation by DCs involves adequate MHC&#8208;I endocytic trafficking and antigenic peptide loading, a process that is only starting to be explored. Taking into account this information, and considering that CD8+ T&#8208;cell responses elicited by the cross&#8208;presentation of tumor antigens are fundamental for the design of novel immunotherapies, we consider that Rab22a could play a central role in future approaches based on the stimulation of DCs and for new vaccination strategies against intracellular parasite infections.</text>

      <text>Dendritic cells infection was performed as described before 34. Briefly, JAWS&#8208;II cells were plated on a 96&#8208;well plate (round bottom) at a concentration of 105 cells per well with 200 &#956;l of GM&#8208;CSF&#8208;containing medium (IMDM). After 48 h, the medium was carefully removed without disturbing the cells and 20 &#956;l of virus (Rab22a #1 and Scramble) was added and the pellet was mixed by pipetting 3&#8211;5 times. After this, 30 &#956;l of polyB in GM&#8208;CSF medium was added (8 &#956;g/ml final concentration) and the plate was centrifuged at 800 g for 90 min at 37&#176;C. After centrifugation, all media were removed and replaced by 200 &#956;l/well of fresh GM&#8208;CSF medium. Plates were incubated for 48 h, and cells were selected with 20 &#956;g/ml of puromycin. Cells were expanded until the establishment of stable cell lines. Transient BMDC infection was performed by using Rab22a #1, Rab22a #2, and Scramble lentiviruses. When not specified, only Rab22a #1 lentivirus was used to silence Rab22a expression in BMDCs. The protocol of infection was the same as for JAWS&#8208;II DCs, but puromycin selection was done with 5 &#956;g/ml since BMDCs are more sensible to this antibiotic. Cells were collected for experiments 72 h after selection.</text>

For transduced BMDCs, we performed incubations with 1 or 3 mg/ml of soluble OVA and the control peptide. Then, DCs were washed with 0.5% of PBS/BSA, fixed with 0.008% glutaraldehyde during 3 min at 4&#176;C, and quenched with 0.2 M glycine. After one final wash with PBS, B3Z hybrid T cells were added during 16 h at 37&#176;C. T&#8208;cell activation was measured detecting &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity by optical density (absorbance at 595&#8211;655 nm) using CPRG as substrate for the reaction. For T. gondii cross&#8208;presentation experiments, the remaining intracellular TgRH YFP SAG1&#8208;OVA parasites were released from the fibroblasts by forcing them through a 23&#8208;G needle and added to Scramble and Rab22a KD DCs at various MOI. After 8 h of infection, DCs were washed, fixed, and confronted with B3Z T cells, as described above. Alternatively, 8 h after parasite infection, the percentage of YFP (+) JAWS&#8208;II cells at different MOI were analyzed by FACS. To evaluate the amount of SAG1&#8208;OVA secreted by T. gondii in Scramble and Rab22a DCs, cells were infected for 90 min and 7 h at MOI 2 and 6. Immunoblotting for OVA, Tubulin, and Rab22a detection was performed by charging 105 lysed cells in every condition.</text>

      <text>JAWS&#8208;II DCs were pre&#8208;treated or not with 7.5 &#956;g/ml of BFA during 30 min at 37&#176;C. After this time, cells were extensively washed with PBS, suspended in 1 mM HEPES/PBS pH 7.4 + OVA at 3 mg/ml, and electroporated by using a Bio&#8208;Rad Gene Pulser II Porator (0.45 kV and 250 &#956;F of voltage and capacitance, respectively) to introduce the antigen into the cytosol. After electroporation, DCs were immediately put on ice and washed once with cold PBS. Then, cells were suspended in complete medium and incubated for 2 h at 37&#176;C in the presence or absence of BFA. Finally, DCs were washed, fixed with glutaraldehyde, and confronted with B3Z CD8+ T cells as described before for cross&#8208;presentation experiments. T&#8208;cell activation was measured detecting &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity by optical density (absorbance at 595&#8211;655 nm). Immunoblotting for OVA, Tubulin, and Rab22a detection was performed by charging 105 lysed cells in every condition.</text>
