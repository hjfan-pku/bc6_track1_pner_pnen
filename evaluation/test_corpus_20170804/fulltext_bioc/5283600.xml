      <text>PRLs (phosphatases of regenerating liver) are frequently overexpressed in human cancers and are prognostic markers of poor survival. Despite their potential as therapeutic targets, their mechanism of action is not understood in part due to their weak enzymatic activity. Previous studies revealed that PRLs interact with CNNM ion transporters and prevent CNNM4&#8208;dependent Mg2+ transport, which is important for energy metabolism and tumor progression. Here, we report that PRL&#8208;CNNM complex formation is regulated by the formation of phosphocysteine. We show that cysteine in the PRL catalytic site is endogenously phosphorylated as part of the catalytic cycle and that phosphocysteine levels change in response to Mg2+ levels. Phosphorylation blocks PRL binding to CNNM Mg2+ transporters, and mutations that block the PRL&#8208;CNNM interaction prevent regulation of Mg2+ efflux in cultured cells. The crystal structure of the complex of PRL2 and the CBS&#8208;pair domain of the Mg2+ transporter CNNM3 reveals the molecular basis for the interaction. The identification of phosphocysteine as a regulatory modification opens new perspectives for signaling by protein phosphatases.</text>

      <text>The phosphatases of regenerating liver (PRLs) are highly oncogenic proteins and strongly associated with the transition to metastatic disease 1, 2. The PRL family belongs to the PTP (protein tyrosine phosphatase) superfamily and is comprised of three closely related proteins: PRL1, PRL2, and PRL3 3. The family was first identified as immediate&#8208;early genes up&#8208;regulated in liver following partial resection and in mitogen&#8208;stimulated cells 4. Several years later, PRL3 was identified as a potent oncogene 300&#8208;fold overexpressed in metastatic liver lesions from colorectal cancer patients 2.</text>

      <text>Clinically, PRL phosphatases are valuable prognostic markers of poor outcome and shortened patient survival (reviewed in 5, 6). Many animal studies have shown that PRLs are oncogenic, yet the mechanisms linking PRLs and cancer have remained unclear. PRLs have been suggested to contribute to cell proliferation and metabolic reprogramming via the PI&#8208;3K/Akt/mTOR pathway; however, it has been difficult to reconcile these models with very poor catalytic activity of PRLs in vitro. The rate&#8208;limiting step in catalysis is the hydrolysis of a phosphoenzyme intermediate. Like other PTPs, the PRL catalytic site contains a conserved cysteine residue that forms a phosphocysteine intermediate as part of the catalytic cycle 7, 8. In the case of PRLs, this intermediate has a long half&#8208;life (&gt; 1 h) and is rate&#8208;limiting for dephosphorylation 9. As a result, PRLs are very poor enzymes, and no confirmed physiological substrates are known 3, 10.</text>

      <text>Recently, PRLs were shown to interact physically with members of the CNNM (cyclin M/ancient conserved domain protein) family to regulate Mg2+ transport (Fig 1A) 11, 12. In mammalian cells, CNNM proteins mediate Mg2+ efflux 13. Four CNNM proteins in humans are known. They are highly conserved but have distinct functions and tissue distributions. CNNMs contain an N&#8208;terminal integral membrane domain followed by a cystathionine&#8208;&#946;&#8208;synthase (CBS) pair domain and a C&#8208;terminal region of 250 residues or more of unknown structure 14, 15. Phylogenetic analysis shows co&#8208;evolution of PRLs and CNNMs suggesting a functional relationship between the two protein families 12.</text>

      <text>Mg2+ is the most abundant divalent cation in cells and required for many essential cellular functions. Mg2+ binds polyphosphate compounds such as ATP to proteins and is required for the activity of many enzymes associated with energy metabolism and nucleic acid synthesis and degradation 16. Cellular Mg2+ homeostasis is maintained through the action of a large number of different Mg2+ transporters present in different cellular membranes. Functional links to diseases have been established for TRPM6, claudin 16, and CNNM2, which cause hypomagnesemia when mutated, and for MagT1, SLC41A1, and CNNM4, which cause other conditions 16, 17. A link between elevated Mg2+ levels and cancer has long been suspected due to the importance of Mg2+ in cell proliferation, apoptotic signals, genetic stability, and metabolic reprogramming 18, 19. CNNM4 was shown to be a tumor suppressor in a mouse model of colon cancer 11, and the interaction between PRLs and CNNMs is required for PRL oncogenicity 12, 20.</text>

      <text>Here, we report that phosphocysteine plays a role in Mg2+ homeostasis. We observe that the interaction between PRLs and CNNM is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of the PRL catalytic cysteine. We observe that endogenous PRL phosphatases are significantly phosphorylated in cultured cells and the phosphorylation levels decrease in response to Mg2+ deprivation. The crystal structure of a PRL phosphatase and fragment of a CNNM transporter reveals the molecular basis for the interaction and its regulation by cysteine phosphorylation. The study offers new insight into the function of PRLs and their long&#8208;lived phosphocysteine intermediate.</text>

      <text>We used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to confirm the association between PRL and CNNM proteins. Previous immunoprecipitation and deletion analysis had shown that the interaction is mediated by the CBS&#8208;pair domain of CNNM proteins 11, 12. We measured one&#8208;to&#8208;one stoichiometry and a Kd of 25 nM between PRL2 and the CNNM3 CBS&#8208;pair domain (Fig 1B).</text>

      <text>We used analysis of sequence conservation within the CNNM proteins to identify potential residues involved in binding PRL2 21. The CBS&#8208;pair domains contain an enlarged loop that has been proposed to bind PRL phosphatases 12. We mutated three residues in the loop, which are conserved across all CNNM family members (Fig 1C and D) 22. ITC experiments showed mutation of Asp426 in the loop decreased binding 500&#8208;fold and confirmed the extended loop as the PRL&#8208;binding site (Fig 1F). Mutation of the adjoining proline and phenylalanine residues had more moderate effects and decreased the affinity respectively 25&#8208;fold and threefold. While this manuscript was in preparation, a more complete set of mutations in the same loop were shown to prevent PRL2 binding 20.</text>

      <text>We next tested the effect of the CBS&#8208;pair domain on PRL catalytic activity. PTPs are characterized by the presence of a conserved active&#8208;site motif HC(X)5R[S/T] with a key cysteine residue that acts as a nucleophile in catalysis (Fig 1A). This leads to formation of a phosphoenzyme intermediate, which is then resolved through the action of serine or threonine in the active&#8208;site motif and an aspartic acid on the neighboring acidic loop. In PRLs, the serine/threonine residue is replaced by an alanine residue, which leads to unusual, burst kinetics due to the slow turnover of phosphocysteine intermediate 9 (Fig 1E).</text>

      <text>We carried out enzymatic kinetic assays with PRL2 using the fluorescent substrate, DiFMUP. As previously reported for PRL3, PRL2 shows burst kinetics. The rapid turnover of one molecule of substrate is followed by a slow steady&#8208;state rate that is determined by the hydrolysis of the phosphocysteine. In the absence of the CNNM3 CBS&#8208;pair domain, PRL2 released 0.75 &#956;M of product in the dead time of the experiment, followed by a linear increase of 1 &#956;M per hour (Fig 1G).</text>

      <text>In the presence of the CNNM3 CBS&#8208;pair domain, the initial burst of activity was completely inhibited. The CNNM3 mutants showed inhibition that paralleled their binding affinities for PRL2. The D426A mutant, which is strongly impaired in its ability to bind PRL2, showed no inhibition. The F428A, which binds with near wild&#8208;type affinity, strongly inhibited catalysis, and the P427A mutant, which has intermediate affinity, moderately inhibited PRL2 phosphatase activity (Fig 1G). These results are consistent with CNNM3 binding to PRL2 as a pseudosubstrate and hindering access of substrates to the active site. The decrease in the initial rate of catalysis reflects the amount of free PRL2.</text>

      <text>The possibility that the CBS&#8208;pair domain bound as a substrate mimic suggested that the catalytic intermediate might inhibit the binding of CNNM proteins. To test this, we prepared phosphorylated PRL2 using a second synthetic substrate, 3&#8208;O&#8208;methylfluorescein phosphate (OMFP). Generation of the phosphocysteine intermediate can be conveniently monitored by SDS&#8211;PAGE using the Phos&#8208;tag reagent that retards the migration of phosphorylated proteins 23. As shown in Fig 2A, addition of OMFP to PRL2 led to full phosphorylation, while PRL2 C101S, which lacks the catalytic cysteine, was not affected. Phosphocysteine is chemically unstable and PRL2 could be dephosphorylated by boiling in SDS loading buffer prior to electrophoresis or by incubation for several hours at room temperature (Fig EV1A). Phosphorylation of PRL2 by OMFP treatment was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The mass of recombinant PRL2 was increased by 80 amu following treatment with OMFP which allows us to conclude that only one phosphorylation site is present (Fig 2B). Addition of OMFP to the C101A mutant had no effect on the mass spectrum. Formation of the phosphocysteine intermediate could also be observed using 31P NMR spectroscopy (Fig 2C). The phosphocysteine chemical shift, 14.8 ppm, is similar to that reported for EIIMtl24. A time series of NMR spectra showed that addition of OMFP to PRL2 led to the rapid formation of phosphocysteine, followed by its decay and generation of free phosphate (Fig EV1B).</text>

      <text>We tested binding of phosphorylated PRL2 to the CNNM3 CBS&#8208;pair domain using pulldown and ITC assays. In GST&#8208;pulldown experiments, only the non&#8208;phosphorylated form of PRL2 was retained by the GST&#8208;CBS&#8208;pair domain (Fig 2D and E). Conversely, phosphorylated PRL2 was only observed in the flow&#8208;through fractions. Identical results were observed with the reverse pulldown experiments in which GST&#8208;PRL2 was used to retain the CBS&#8208;pair domain of CNNM3. Binding was again blocked by treatment of PRL2 with OMFP (Fig EV1C). Incubation following OMFP treatment led to partial dephosphorylation of PRL2 and a restoration of CNNM3 CBS&#8208;pair binding. We also confirmed the lack of binding using ITC experiments. Phosphorylation of PRL2 by OMFP treatment prevented binding to the CNNM3 CBS&#8208;pair (Fig 2E). To our knowledge, this is the first example in eukaryotes of regulation of a protein&#8211;protein interaction by phosphocysteine.</text>

      <text>In addition to formation of phosphocysteine, the catalytic cysteine of PTP family phosphatases can be oxidized to a variety of forms 25. We treated PRL2 with diamide, a weak oxidizing agent, and performed ITC (Fig 2E). Diamide treatment significantly decreased the affinity of PRL2 for the CNNM3 CBS&#8208;pair domain as previously observed in pulldown assays with intact CNNM proteins 11, 12. The catalytic cysteine per se was not required for binding. Mutation of the catalytic cysteine and the adjoining cysteine that can form a disulfide bond did not prevent PRL2 binding to the CNNM3 CBS&#8208;pair domain (Fig 2F). Intriguingly, this differs from results obtained with the full&#8208;length CNNM proteins where both cysteines were required in cultured cells 11, 12.</text>

      <text>We next tested whether the previously described CNNM mutations inhibit the interaction in cells.

CNNM3 is inactive in the cell Mg2+ efflux assay 26. The CBS domains of CNNM3 and CNNM4 are highly similar and are 100% identical in the regions that interact with PRLs (Fig 1C). We prepared the loop mutations in CNNM4 and expressed the proteins in COS7 cells along with Myc&#8208;tagged PRL3 (Fig 3A). As observed with CNNM3 and PRL2, mutation of the aspartic acid residue (D485A) in the CBS&#8208;pair domain blocked the co&#8208;IP of CNNM4 and PRL3. Mutation of the other two residues in CBS loop (P486A and F487A) showed smaller effects on the co&#8208;IP in agreement with the results observed with the purified CNNM3 and PRL2 proteins.</text>

      <text>CNNM4 has previously been shown to mediate Mg2+ efflux and that this is inhibited by PRL3 11. We repeated this assay to assess the functional consequences of CBS&#8208;pair mutations. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to confirm the localization of the transfected proteins (Fig EV2). As previously observed, CNNM4 expression in HEK293 cells led to a large decrease in intracellular Mg2+ levels as measured by Magnesium Green fluorescence when Mg2+ was removed from the extracellular milieu (Fig 3B). The drop in intracellular Mg2+ levels was completely blocked when PRL3 was co&#8208;expressed with CNNM4 (Fig 3C).</text>

      <text>To understand how PRL phosphorylation and oxidation regulate CNNM binding, we determined the structure of a complex of PRL2 and the CBS&#8208;pair domain of CNNM3 (Fig 4; Table EV1). In the structure, the CBS&#8208;pair domain is present as a dimer in the head&#8208;to&#8208;head arrangement that is typical for other CBS&#8208;pair domains. The CBS&#8208;pair domain is composed of two tandem modules, CBS1 (residues 324&#8211;378) and CBS2 (residues 390&#8211;446), related by an approximate twofold symmetry (Fig 4A). As previously observed for CNNM2 and CNNM4 21, 27, the CNNM3 CBS&#8208;pair domain contains a long extended &#946;&#8208;stranded loop that extends away from the dimerization interface. Each of the extended loops binds one PRL2 molecule.</text>

      <text>Complex formation is mediated by the CNNM loop (residues 418&#8211;430) which contacts the PRL2 catalytic site (Fig 4B&#8211;D). In agreement with the mutagenesis studies, Asp426 of CNNM3 plays a key role in binding PRL2. The aspartic acid side chain sits in the pocket formed by the phosphatase P&#8208;loop and WPFDD motif and likely mimics the negatively charged phosphate of a bound substrate. In addition to the many polar contacts, Pro427 and Tyr429 provide a hydrophobic surface that contacts Leu105 of PRL2. The relatively small surface area between PRL2 and CNNM3 highlights the importance of the many electrostatic interactions. The structure is similar to the model of the complex based on interaction surfaces identified by mutagenesis 20.</text>

As observed with purified PRL2, boiling of the lysates prior to electrophoresis hydrolyzed phosphocysteine and led to complete loss of the upper band. We also confirmed that the catalytic cysteine was required for formation of the phosphorylated form of the protein. Mutation of the catalytic cysteine (C104) but not the adjacent cysteine (C49) in FLAG&#8208;PRL1 prevented formation of the phosphocysteine intermediate (Fig 5B).</text>

      <text>Finally, we asked whether the level of phosphorylation of PRL proteins varied in response to environmental conditions. We analyzed cell lysates of HEK293 and HeLa cells following a switch to a growth medium without Mg2+ (Fig 5E). Before Mg2+ depletion (at time 0), a significant amount of endogenous PRL was phosphorylated as detected on Phos&#8208;tag gels using an antibody that recognizes all three PRL isoforms. Based on the immunostaining, most of the PRL proteins in HeLa cells and roughly half in HEK293 cells were phosphorylated. When subjected to Mg2+ depletion for 24 h, there was a very clear decrease in the ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated PRLs in both cell lines (compare the 0&#8208; and 24&#8208;h time points in the right most lanes). We also observed a large increase in the total level of PRL proteins as also evident in the SDS&#8211;PAGE gels without the Phos&#8208;tag reagent. These results support a model in which unphosphorylated PRLs bind CNNM transporters to maintain intracellular Mg2+ levels.</text>

      <text>Cysteine phosphorylation is a rare protein modification only known to occur in a few contexts. It was first observed in bacteria as part of the phosphorylation cascade for bacterial sugar uptake 32. More recently, cysteine phosphorylation was observed in the regulation of bacterial transcriptional signaling 33. In eukaryotes, cysteine phosphorylation has long been known to occur as an enzymatic intermediate for protein phosphatases but not in a regulatory role 34. The chemical instability of phosphocysteine makes it difficult to detect. The sulfur&#8211;phosphorus bond is sensitive to low pH and to heating, so typical conditions for the preparation of samples for LC&#8211;MS and SDS&#8211;PAGE lead to its degradation. The techniques developed here, particularly the use of Phos&#8208;tag gels, are likely to lead to the observation of phosphocysteine in new contexts. Specifically, it is possible that other PTPs such as DUSP19 that have the same alanine substitution in the catalytic site may be regulated by formation of a long&#8208;lived phosphocysteine intermediate.</text>

      <text>Phosphorylation of PRLs is not the direct result of kinase activity. PRLs are autophosphorylated in a reaction that depends on the availability of substrate and the phosphatase redox state. Phosphatidylinositol phosphates and a number of proteins have been proposed as PRL substrates, but as yet there is no clear consensus 3. We observed that recombinant PRL2 purified from E. coli is partially phosphorylated in the absence of added substrate (Fig 2D and F, PRL2 input lanes). The phosphorylation of PRL2 in E. coli rules out the requirement of a eukaryote&#8208;specific substrate for its phosphorylation. The dephosphorylation rate appears to be an intrinsic property of the phosphatases. The rate measured in vitro with PRL2 is similar to the rate observed in cells, although the cell&#8208;based experiment did not distinguish between new protein synthesis, ongoing phosphorylation, and dephosphorylation.</text>

      <text>PRL phosphorylation is likely controlled in part by oxidation of catalytic site. Like protein tyrosine phosphatases, PRLs are prone to oxidation to a variety of catalytically inactive forms 9, 25. In vitro, PRLs can only be phosphorylated when fully reduced. Some of the forms such as the catalytic cysteine disulfide are reversible, while others are not. Widely considered a mechanism for regulating phosphatase activity, oxidation of the PRL active site also leads to a decrease in CBS&#8208;pair domain binding. We observed a 200&#8208;fold decrease in affinity following diamide treatment in agreement with pulldown experiments with H2O211, 12. The loss of affinity is likely due to a conformational change since, in our crystal structure, the catalytic cysteine does not directly contact the CBS&#8208;pair domain.</text>

In contrast, Funato and colleagues observed Mg2+ efflux and PRL3 inhibition of CNNM4 activity 11.

Mutations in CNNM4 that specifically block PRL binding are active in Mg2+ efflux but prevent the inhibition by PRL3. The G433D CNNM3 mutation previously reported to block the interaction 12 likely unfolds the CBS&#8208;pair domain as the glycine residue is buried in the structure. Attempts to express the recombinant CBS&#8208;pair domain with the G433D mutation were unsuccessful (not shown), and the equivalent mutation in CNNM4, G492D, was inactive for Mg2+ efflux, likely due to its mislocalization (Fig EV2).</text>

Thus, while there are differences in the nature of the regulation, stimulatory or inhibitory, there is clear consensus that the PRL&#8208;CNNM interaction plays a role in cellular Mg2+ homeostasis.</text>

      <text>The identification of CNNM proteins as tumor suppressors and their inhibition by PRL proteins provides an explanation for the strong association of PRLs with metastatic disease 25. Through direct binding, PRLs inhibit CNNM&#8208;dependent Mg2+ efflux to raise intracellular Mg2+ and promote proliferation. As shown here, PRLs can act as pseudophosphatases specifically for CNNM proteins. The aspartic acid of CNNM proteins binds to the active site and mimics the phosphate group of a substrate. The binding of pseudophosphatases is typically regulated by the phosphorylation of the binding partner 35, 36, but in the case of PRLs, the binding is regulated by phosphorylation and oxidation of the active site. Unlike other pseudophosphatases, PRLs retain their catalytic activity and, in fact, their catalytic activity regulates CNNM binding.</text>

      <text>Guo et al37 first showed the importance of the phosphatase activity in tumor promotion based on mutagenesis studies. They observed that an inactive PRL3 mutant in which the catalytic cysteine was replaced with serine failed to promote tumor formation. This same mutation in PRL2 prevents CNNM3 binding 12, and the mutation in PRL3 prevents CNNM4 binding 11. Surprisingly, pulldown assays with purified PRL2 and the isolated CBS&#8208;pair domain from CNNM3 show that the catalytic cysteine is not essential for CNNM binding (Fig 2F). The difference between our in vitro assays and results in cultured cells is indicative of additional complexity in the PRL&#8208;CNNM interaction. Of interest, cysteine 49 in PRL3, which can form a disulfide bond with the catalytic cysteine, is not required for catalytic activity but is required for PRL3 oncogenicity 11. The biological consequences of disulfide bond formation, cysteine phosphorylation, and PRL catalytic activity remain key questions for future investigation.</text>

      <text>150 &#956;g of PRL2 WT or PRL2 C101A (both without the CCVQ prenylation motif) was untreated or treated with 2 nmol of OMFP for 45 min at 30&#176;C. The protein samples were desalted using Amicon Ultra 0.5&#8208;ml centrifugal filters with a 10&#8208;kDa molecular weight cutoff. Then, the samples were dissolved in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid for direct injection into ESI&#8211;MS using the Bruker amaZon speed ETD. Deconvolution of resulting mass spectra was performed using Compass software (Bruker).</text>

      <text>Mg2+ imaging analyses with Magnesium Green were performed as described previously 13, with slight modifications. The cells were incubated with Mg2+ loading buffer (78.1 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 40 mM MgCl2, 5.5 mM glucose, and 5.5 mM HEPES&#8211;KOH, pH 7.4), including 2 &#956;M Magnesium Green&#8208;AM (Invitrogen), and were viewed using a microscope (IX81; Olympus) equipped with an ORCA&#8208;Flash 4.0 CMOS camera (Hamamatsu) and a USH&#8208;1030L mercury lamp (Olympus). Fluorescence was measured (excitation at 470&#8211;490 nm and emission at 505&#8211;545 nm) using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). Then, the buffer was changed to buffer without Mg2+ (MgCl2 was replaced with 60 mM NaCl). The data are presented as line plots (mean of 10 cells). After imaging analyses, cells were fixed with PBS containing 3.7% formaldehyde and subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy to confirm protein expression.</text>

The model was extended manually using Coot 40 and improved by several cycles of refinement using Refmac 41 and translation&#8211;libration&#8211;screw (TLS) refinement. Structure figures were produced using PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org). The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ (http://www.rcsb.org/).</text>

      <text>We obtained mouse and rabbit anti&#8208;FLAG antibodies from Sigma, mouse and rabbit anti&#8208;Myc antibodies from Santa Cruz, and mouse anti&#8208;PRL2 monoclonal antibody from Millipore. Anti&#8208;PRL polyclonal antibody that recognizes all three PRL isoforms equally was generated in the previous study 11. Transfected COS7 or HEK293 cells were washed with PBS and harvested with lysis buffer (20 mM Tris&#8211;HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X&#8208;100, 2 mM EDTA, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were incubated with agarose bead&#8208;conjugated anti&#8208;FLAG antibody (Wako). The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS&#8211;PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. After blocking, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies and then with alkaline phosphatase&#8208;conjugated anti&#8208;rabbit IgG (Promega) for chromogenic detection with 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;4&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium.</text>

After centrifugation, supernatants were incubated with anti&#8208;PRL2 antibody (Millipore), and this mixture was then incubated with Protein A Dynabeads (ThermoFisher). The complex was finally eluted from the beads using strong SDS loading dye (70 mM Tris&#8211;HCl, 10% SDS, 7.5% glycerol, 10% &#946;&#8208;mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% bromophenol blue, pH 6.8) without boiling.
