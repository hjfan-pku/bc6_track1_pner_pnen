      <text>Zika virus is an emerging mosquito&#8208;borne pathogen that is associated with Guillain&#8211;Barr&#233; syndrome in adults and microcephaly and other neurological defects in newborns. Despite being declared an international emergency by the World Health Organization, comparatively little is known about its biology. Here, we investigate the strategies employed by the virus to suppress the host antiviral response. We observe that once established, Zika virus infection is impervious to interferon treatment suggesting that the virus deploys effective countermeasures to host cell defences. This is confirmed by experiments showing that Zika virus infection impairs the induction of type&#8208;I interferon as well as downstream interferon&#8208;stimulated genes. Multiple viral proteins affect these processes. Virus&#8208;mediated degradation of STAT2 acts to reduce type&#8208;I and type&#8208;III interferon&#8208;mediated signaling. Further, the NS5 of Zika virus binds to STAT2, and its expression is correlated with STAT2 degradation by the proteasome. Together, our findings provide key insights into how Zika virus blocks cellular defense systems. This in turn is important for understanding pathogenesis and may aid in designing antiviral therapies.</text>

      <text>Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging arbovirus belonging to the family Flaviviridae and is transmitted by mosquitoes of the Aedes spp 1. The virus was originally identified in Uganda in 1947, but the first major reported outbreak of this pathogen was not until 2007 in the Micronesian island of Yap 2. Over the next seven years, outbreaks were reported in other Pacific islands 3. In 2015, the largest Zika pandemic to date began in Brazil 4 and has since rapidly spread throughout the Americas infecting nearly two million people. Although most Zika cases in Brazil were asymptomatic or manifested as a flu&#8208;like illness, there was a very large increase in the incidence of Guillain&#8211;Barr&#233; syndrome 5 and neurological birth defects including microcephaly in newborns 6. It is now generally accepted that ZIKV is a teratogenic agent that crosses the placental barrier and inflicts severe neurological damage in developing foetuses 7, 8. In addition to transmission by mosquito bites, ZIKV can be spread by sexual contact 9, 10.</text>

      <text>The interferon (IFN) system plays a crucial role in combating viral infections in mammalian cells. The genetic material from incoming RNA viruses is detected by toll&#8208;like receptors present on the cell surface and in endosomal compartments, whereas double&#8208;strand RNA (dsRNA) from intracellular viral replication is detected by the cytoplasmic RNA sensors RIG&#8208;I and MDA5 11. This leads to activation of transcription factors such as interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF&#8208;&#954;B resulting in IFN production. In the IFN signaling (effector) phase, secreted IFN binds to cognate receptors and initiates a signaling cascade that results in transcription of IFN&#8208;stimulated genes (ISGs), which encode proteins that inhibit virus replication and spread. Productive replication of flaviviruses is linked with their ability to block IFN induction and signaling pathways. For example, Dengue (DENV) and West Nile viruses, which are close relatives to ZIKV, have evolved diverse strategies to block the IFN response 12. The protective role of the IFN system against flaviviruses is evident from the observation that unlike wild&#8208;type mice, type&#8208;I IFN signaling&#8208;deficient mice are highly susceptible to infection by both ZIKV 13 and DENV 14, 15.</text>

      <text>In this study, we investigated the strategies used by ZIKV to suppress host innate immune defenses in order to establish productive infection. We observed that ZIKV&#8208;infected cells failed to mount a robust immune response, particularly in the early phase of infection. Although ZIKV replication was significantly inhibited in cells that were primed with the dsRNA analogue, poly(I:C) or by pre&#8208;treatment with IFNs, once established, ZIKV replication was impervious to either treatment. This suggests that the virus employs effective countermeasures to the innate immune response, and indeed, we observed strong suppression of IFN and ISG expression in ZIKV&#8208;infected cells. Viral proteins NS1, NS4A, and NS5 were identified as key suppressors of type&#8208;I IFN induction. Moreover, we observed a significant reduction in type&#8208;I and type&#8208;III IFN signaling in ZIKV&#8208;infected cells as well as degradation of the antiviral transcriptional activator STAT2, a key component of these signaling pathways. Further analysis identified proteasomal degradation as the mechanism by which STAT2 is depleted in ZIKV&#8208;infected cells. Finally, we identified ZIKV NS5 protein as a potent inhibitor of IFN signaling that acts by inducing degradation of STAT2. A direct interaction between ZIKV NS5 and STAT2 was detected, which was primarily mediated by the methyltransferase (MTase) domain of NS5. These data suggest that ZIKV employs multiple mechanisms to block the host IFN response.</text>

      <text>To establish an environment that is conducive to replication, many viruses block the host cell IFN response through multiple mechanisms. For example, DENV inhibits the RIG&#8208;I&#8208;mediated responses by blocking both induction and downstream signaling of type&#8208;I IFN, a process that involves the viral proteins NS2B&#8208;3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 16, 17. As a first step toward understanding how ZIKV affects the IFN system, we measured the induction of Ifnb and the downstream antiviral gene Ifit1 by qRT&#8211;PCR at various times post&#8208;infection. During the early phase of ZIKV infection, there was delayed induction of Ifnb and Ifit1 and peak expression of both genes was not observed until 24&#8211;48 h (Fig EV1). This was not due to an inability of cells to mount a rapid response as it can be seen that poly(I:C) treatment induced robust expression of these genes by 12 h. The delayed IFN response in ZIKV&#8208;infected cells could be due to an inability of the cells to efficiently detect viral RNA and/or an active suppression of the RNA&#8208;mediated antiviral signaling pathway by ZIKV. To address these potential scenarios, we pre&#8208;treated cells with poly(I:C) to activate the innate immune response and then examined the effect on ZIKV infection. As shown in Fig 1A, virus replication was reduced by &gt; 80% in treated cells, indicating that at early stages of infection, the cells can mount a strong antiviral response. However, addition of poly(I:C) to cells that were pre&#8208;infected with ZIKV had little effect on replication (Fig 1A), suggesting that the virus efficiently blocks dsRNA&#8208;stimulated IFN response.</text>

      <text>To further investigate whether ZIKV modulates the induction and/or effector phase of the IFN response, we quantified poly(I:C)&#8208;induced expression of Ifnb and Ifit1 in ZIKV&#8208;infected and mock&#8208;treated cells. As shown in Fig 1B, ZIKV infection strongly inhibited expression of Ifnb and Ifit1 indicating a suppression of both induction and signaling of IFNs. Consistent with these data, the activity of the IFIT1 promoter, which has both IRF3&#8208;binding sites and interferon&#8208;sensitive response element (ISRE), was reduced in ZIKV&#8208;infected cells (Fig 1C). To determine which viral component(s) is responsible for suppressing the IFN system, we expressed individual ZIKV proteins and examined their effects on dsRNA&#8208;induced IFN response by measuring activity of the IFIT1 promoter. Our data showed that IFIT1 promoter activity was affected by multiple ZIKV proteins, with the strongest suppression (~70%) observed in cells expressing NS5 and a moderate inhibition (40%) in those expressing E or NS4A (Fig 1D). To further understand how ZIKV inhibits the induction of type&#8208;I IFNs, we examined the effect of viral infection on IFN&#8208;&#946;, IRF3, and NF&#8208;&#954;B reporter activities. These experiments revealed that ZIKV infection efficiently blocked poly(I:C)&#8208;stimulated expression of all three reporters (Fig 1E). To identify the viral component(s) responsible for suppressing type&#8208;I IFN production, we measured the activities of these reporters in the presence of individual ZIKV proteins. The expression of NS1, NS4A, and NS5 significantly inhibited the activities of both IFN&#8208;&#946; and IRF3 reporters (Fig 1F) while a moderate reduction in NF&#8208;&#954;B activity was observed in cells expressing NS5 (Fig EV2). Taken together, these data indicate that ZIKV is very efficient at blocking both the induction and effector phases of the type&#8208;I IFN response, a process that is mediated by the viral proteins NS1, NS4A, and NS5.</text>

      <offset>12182</offset>
      <text>Recent studies in mouse models suggest that the effector phase of IFN response is important for controlling ZIKV infection and associated pathogenesis 13, 18. Here, we further investigated the effect of ZIKV infection on the IFN effector phase and the key viral components involved. To determine how sensitive ZIKV is to IFN&#8208;mediated antiviral signaling, A549 cells were treated with IFN&#8208;&#945;, IFN&#8208;&#947;, or IFN&#8208;&#955; prior to infection and then replication was assessed. Whereas ZIKV replication was moderately affected by IFN&#8208;&#955;, the virus was much more sensitive to pre&#8208;treatment with IFN&#8208;&#945; or IFN&#8208;&#947; (Fig 2A). These results are consistent with previous observations with ZIKV 19 and other flaviviruses such as DENV 20 indicating that in order to maintain a productive infection, the virus must employ strategies to block IFN&#8208;dependent antiviral defense. To address the question of whether ZIKV actively suppresses IFN signaling, we infected cells with ZIKV followed by treatment with different IFNs. Data in Fig 2A show that viral replication was largely unaffected when IFNs were administered after productive ZIKV infection was already established. These results are consistent with data in Fig 2B showing that IFN&#8208;induced expression of the ISG Ifit1 is substantially reduced by ZIKV infection. Interestingly, Ifit1 induction by IFN&#8208;&#945; and IFN&#8208;&#955;, but not IFN&#8208;&#947;, was suppressed in ZIKV&#8208;infected cells (Fig 2B). This indicates that type&#8208;I and type&#8208;III IFN signaling but not type&#8208;II signaling pathways are blocked by ZIKV. To further investigate this, we measured the IFN&#8208;&#945; and IFN&#8208;&#947; signaling through ISRE&#8208; and gamma&#8208;activated sequence (GAS) promoters, respectively, in ZIKV&#8208;infected cells. We observed that IFN&#8208;dependent ISRE signaling but not GAS signaling was reduced by ZIKV (Fig 2C). To determine which ZIKV protein mediates the subversion of type&#8208;I IFN signaling, we expressed individual ZIKV proteins in HEK293T cells and examined their effects on the ISRE promoter activity. As shown in Fig 2D, expression of NS5 protein strongly reduced (90%) ISRE&#8208;dependent IFN signaling. In summary, these data indicate that ZIKV interferes with the effector phase of the IFN response, a process mediated in large part by NS5 protein.</text>

      <infon key="type">paragraph</infon>
      <offset>16309</offset>
      <text>The transcriptional activator STAT2 is a critical component of antiviral defense systems that acts downstream of type&#8208;I/III IFN receptor activation. Previous studies have shown that STAT2 is targeted by several viruses including respiratory syncytial virus 21, 22, Nipah virus 23, 24, and the closely related DENV 25. Initially, we examined whether levels of STAT2 protein were affected by ZIKV infection. Immunoblotting revealed that within 24 h, STAT2 protein levels were almost completely abolished in ZIKV&#8208;infected cells, while STAT1 levels remained unchanged (Fig 3A). The fact that STAT1 was unaltered in ZIKV&#8208;infected cells is consistent with our earlier data showing that type&#8208;II IFN signaling is not significantly disrupted by ZIKV infection (Fig 2C). Analyses by confocal microscopy confirmed the immunoblot data showing that STAT2 was absent from ZIKV&#8208;infected A549 cells (Fig 3C), whereas STAT1 was unaffected (Fig EV3A). The same phenotype was observed in primary human fetal astrocytes (Fig 3C), and it is tempting to speculate that the virus deploys this mechanism to undermine host IFN response in the fetal brain. Next, we examined the mechanism by which ZIKV induces STAT2 degradation. ZIKV&#8208;infected cells were treated with inhibitors of the proteasome (MG132 and epoxomicin) or lysosomes (bafilomycin&#8208;A1). STAT2 levels were rescued by treatment with both MG132 and epoxomicin (Fig 3B) but not bafilomycin&#8208;A1 (Fig EV3B), indicating that ZIKV infection results in proteasome&#8208;dependent STAT2 degradation.</text>

      <text>Recent studies demonstrated that ZIKV is not lethal for wild&#8208;type mice, whereas those lacking type&#8208;I IFN receptors (AG129, Ifnar1&#8722;/&#8722;) are highly susceptible to the virus 13, 18. Based on our data, we surmised that one of the limiting factors for productive infection in wild&#8208;type mice could be the inability of ZIKV to induce STAT2 degradation in murine cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that ZIKV infection of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) did not result in loss of STAT2 (Fig 3D). Moreover, transient knockdown of STAT2 in MEFs enhanced ZIKV replication by up to fivefold (Fig 3E). This suggests that in addition to IFNAR&#8722;/&#8722;, mice deficient in STAT2 may serve as an animal model for ZIKV infection. Collectively, these results suggest that targeting of STAT2 for degradation is a key mechanism by which ZIKV blocks IFN signaling in human cells.</text>

      <text>To identify the viral component(s) that are required for STAT2 degradation, we expressed individual ZIKV proteins in A549 cells and examined their effects on the levels of STAT2. STAT2 levels were dramatically reduced in cells expressing NS5, indicating a role for this protein in ZIKV&#8208;induced degradation of STAT2 (Fig EV4). This result is consistent with our earlier observation that NS5 strongly suppresses IFN&#8208;mediated ISRE signaling (Fig 2D). Previous studies have shown that NS5 of DENV also causes loss of STAT2 16, 26. However, unlike DENV NS5, ZIKV NS5&#8208;mediated degradation of STAT2 did not require cotranslational endoproteolytic processing (Fig EV4). To further investigate the nature of NS5&#8208;dependent degradation of STAT2, levels of STAT2 were compared in cells expressing each of the two functional domains of NS5, methyl transferase (MTase) and polymerase (RdRP). While STAT2 degradation was negligible in cells expressing the RdRP domain, levels of STAT2 were significantly lower in many cells expressing the MTase domain (Fig 4A and B). Methyltransferase activity was not required for STAT2 degradation as evidenced by the fact that levels of the protein were lower in cells expressing the S56A mutant (Fig 4A and B). Finally, unlike DENV NS5 16, the first 10 amino acid residues of ZIKV NS5 are not important for degradation of STAT2 (Fig 4A and B).</text>

      <text>Next, we examined whether NS5 of ZIKV binds STAT2 by performing co&#8208;immunoprecipitation in cells expressing FLAG&#8208;tagged NS5. We observed stable interaction between NS5 and STAT2 (Fig 4C), a process that may be required for the eventual degradation of STAT2. We further mapped this interaction to the MTase domain (Fig 4D), which is consistent with the finding that expression of this domain alone decreases levels of STAT2 protein. However, the MTase domain was not as effective as full&#8208;length NS5 at inducing degradation of STAT2 indicating that other regions of the protein may contribute to this process. Together, our data indicate that a major mechanism by which ZIKV disrupts IFN signaling is through NS5&#8208;mediated binding and degradation of STAT2.</text>

      <text>Recent studies in mouse models 13, 18 and primary trophoblasts 27 point to a vital role for the IFN system in curtailing ZIKV infection. Here, we show that ZIKV employs multiple strategies to block antiviral signaling in host cells. This includes interfering with the production of type&#8208;I IFNs as well as downstream signaling. Specifically, ZIKV inhibits the induction of type&#8208;I IFNs by suppressing the IRF3 and NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling, which is mediated by NS1, NS4A, and NS5. We also showed that ZIKV efficiently blocks IFN signaling by inducing proteasome&#8208;mediated degradation of STAT2. We demonstrated that NS5 is the key viral determinant for STAT2 degradation and it interacts with STAT2 through its MTase domain. We are further investigating the mechanisms by which this pathogen interferes with antiviral signaling and it is hoped that the resulting information may be exploited for design of vaccines or compounds that block ZIKV replication.</text>

Hobman, unpublished data) as the template and cloned into between NheI and XhoI restriction sites in pCDNA 3.1 plasmid. ZIKV capsid and envelope were generated by PCR using cDNA generated from total RNA extracted from ZIKV (strain PLCal_ZIKV)&#8208;infected A549 cells. The cDNAs were subcloned between NheI and XhoI restriction sites in pCDNA 3.1. All primer pairs used in PCR are tagged with a FLAG epitope at the C&#8208;terminus (Table EV1). The pCDNA 3.1 prM&#8208;E and NS1&#8208;FLAG was commercially synthesized based on the sequence from ZIKV (strain H/PF/2013). To ensure proper topology of the viral proteins, prM&#8208;E construct was generated with the membrane anchor of capsid, envelope with the last transmembrane segment of prM, NS1 with the last transmembrane segment of envelope protein, and NS4B with the 2K fragment. NS5 mutants were generated by PCR using pCDNA3.1&#8208;NS5&#8208;FLAG as template and primer pairs described in Table EV1. For indirect immunofluorescence analysis in A549 cells and MEFs, transfection of the appropriate expression plasmids was performed using TransIT&#8208;LT1 (Mirus). For luciferase reporter assays in A549 or HEK293T cells, plasmid transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). poly(I:C) (Sigma&#8208;Aldrich) was transfected into cells using TransIT&#8208;LT1.</text>
