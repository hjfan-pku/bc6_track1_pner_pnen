      <text>Synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease are characterized by the pathological deposition of misfolded &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregates into inclusions throughout the central and peripheral nervous system. Mounting evidence suggests that intercellular propagation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregates may contribute to the neuropathology; however, the mechanism by which spread occurs is not fully understood. By using quantitative fluorescence microscopy with co&#8208;cultured neurons, here we show that &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils efficiently transfer from donor to acceptor cells through tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) inside lysosomal vesicles. Following transfer through TNTs, &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils are able to seed soluble &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregation in the cytosol of acceptor cells. We propose that donor cells overloaded with &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregates in lysosomes dispose of this material by hijacking TNT&#8208;mediated intercellular trafficking. Our findings thus reveal a possible novel role of TNTs and lysosomes in the progression of synucleinopathies.</text>

      <text>Alpha&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;synuclein) is a 140 amino acid protein widely expressed in the brain, localized principally in the cytosol and at presynaptic terminals in association with vesicles. Its exact function is still unclear, although it appears to be involved in neurotransmitter release (Bendor et&#160;al, 2013; Burr&#233; et&#160;al, 2013). Misfolded &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregates into intraneuronal inclusions called Lewy bodies (LB) and intraglial inclusions, associated with neuronal and glial loss in specific regions of the brain. These inclusions represent the histopathological hallmark of synucleinopathies that include Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA), which are characterized by a chronic and progressive decline in motor, cognitive, behavioural and autonomic functions (McCann et&#160;al, 2014).</text>

      <text>Considerable efforts have been made to understand the progression of synucleinopathies. Braak and colleagues were the first to show that &#945;&#8208;synuclein neuropathology progresses throughout the brain in a specific and predictable manner, suggesting that the progression of the disease is associated with the propagation of a neurotropic infectious entity (Braak et&#160;al, 2003a,b). Recent data indicate that this neurotropic agent might be aggregated &#945;&#8208;synuclein. Pioneering studies supporting this hypothesis evidenced the presence of LB in grafted foetal mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons in the brain of PD subjects over 10&#160;years after transplantation (Kordower et&#160;al, 2008; Li et&#160;al, 2008). Since then, intercellular &#945;&#8208;synuclein transfer in&#160;vitro and in&#160;vivo has been reported (Desplats et&#160;al, 2009; Hansen et&#160;al, 2011; Kordower et&#160;al, 2011; Angot et&#160;al, 2012; Luk et&#160;al, 2012a,b; Mougenot et&#160;al, 2012; Masuda&#8208;Suzukake et&#160;al, 2013, 2014; Bae et&#160;al, 2014; Recasens et&#160;al, 2014). Furthermore, it has been shown that fibrillar &#945;&#8208;synuclein seeds the aggregation of the soluble form of the protein in a prion&#8208;like manner (Bousset et&#160;al, 2013; Auli&#263; et&#160;al, 2014; Volpicelli&#8208;Daley et&#160;al, 2014). Knowledge of the precise mechanism of &#945;&#8208;synuclein propagation from one cell to another is therefore needed for better understanding the mechanism of disease progression. Although secretion was shown to be a possible mechanism of &#945;&#8208;synuclein intercellular transfer (Desplats et&#160;al, 2009; Lee et&#160;al, 2010, 2013; Hansen et&#160;al, 2011; Freundt et&#160;al, 2012; Konno et&#160;al, 2012; Brahic et&#160;al, 2016), the predictable and specific patterns of spreading of &#945;&#8208;synuclein inclusions in the brains of PD patients (Braak et&#160;al, 2003b) together with in&#160;vitro and in&#160;vivo studies (Freundt et&#160;al, 2012; Rey et&#160;al, 2013; Holmqvist et&#160;al, 2014; Peelaerts et&#160;al, 2015) suggest a mechanism of spread following neuronal circuits.</text>

      <text>Here, we developed a robust cell model to study in&#160;vitro the mechanism of cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell transfer of structurally and functionally characterized fluorescent human &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils previously shown to recapitulate &#945;&#8208;synuclein pathogenicity by being toxic and inducing seeding in neuronal cells and in animal models (Pieri et&#160;al, 2012; Bousset et&#160;al, 2013; Peelaerts et&#160;al, 2015). We specifically investigated the role of tunneling nanotubes, F&#8208;actin containing membranous bridges that connect the cytoplasm of remote cells (Abounit &amp; Zurzolo, 2012), allowing direct transfer of various cargoes (Austefjord et&#160;al, 2014) and thereby implicated in several physiological processes (Marzo et&#160;al, 2012). TNTs have been found in tissues of various origins (Chinnery et&#160;al, 2008; Lou et&#160;al, 2012; Seyed&#8208;Razavi et&#160;al, 2013; Ady et&#160;al, 2014), and recently TNT&#8208;like connections have been observed in human glioblastoma tumours implanted in mouse brains (Osswald et&#160;al, 2015). Of interest, data showing TNT&#8208;mediated HIV transfer from infected to uninfected T&#160;cells (Sowinski et&#160;al, 2008) and transfer of prions and other pathogens (Onfelt et&#160;al, 2004; Gousset &amp; Zurzolo, 2009; Gousset et&#160;al, 2009) support the role of TNTs as a general conduit used by pathogens for spreading.</text>

      <text>In the present study, we found that efficient transfer of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils between neuron&#8208;like cells and primary neurons in culture relied on tunneling nanotubes (TNTs). Following TNT&#8208;mediated transfer, &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils were able to induce the aggregation of soluble, endogenous &#945;&#8208;synuclein in acceptor cells. Most importantly, we show for the first time that fibrils normally directed to the lysosomal compartment for degradation both in neuron&#8208;like cells and in primary neurons can shuttle between cells in TNTs within lysosomal vesicles. Overall, our results support TNTs as efficient means for propagation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils between neurons, and reveal a novel role played by lysosomes in this cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell transfer process.</text>

      <text>To investigate whether &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils could transfer between neurons, we first assessed whether recombinant human &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils of known dimension and molecular mass (on average 4,000 monomers for one fibril, Pieri et&#160;al, 2012) (Fig&#160;EV1A) were capable of entering catecholaminergic mouse (CAD) neuron&#8208;like cells. In time course experiments, we quantified the percentage of cells containing the fluorescent &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils using flow cytometry and found a time&#8208;dependent internalization of fibrils with maximum fluorescence reached after 6&#160;h (Figs&#160;1A and EV1B). Time course measurements of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release after exposure to &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils (up to 1&#160;&#956;M) showed no change compared to control cells (Fig&#160;EV1C). This suggested that cells were viable, thus validating their use as donor cells in our transfer assay (see below and schematic in Fig&#160;EV2).</text>

      <text>Schematic of the experimental design of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibril internalization and transfer between primary neurons. Donor neurons pre&#8208;loaded with ATTO&#8208;550 &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils were co&#8208;cultured with CTG&#8208;labelled acceptor neurons for 72&#160;h. Acceptor neurons were prepared from a different dissection and labelled in suspension before adding them on top of the donor neurons. After 72&#160;h, the cells are fixed and imaged and (i) the percentage of cells containing &#945;&#8208;synuclein puncta and (ii) the number and average size of &#945;&#8208;synuclein puncta per cell are quantified using ICY software.</text>

      <text>Although transfer of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils between neuronal cells has been shown, quantification (i.e. percentage of cells containing fibrils, number and size of &#945;&#8208;synuclein foci) and intracellular localization of the transferred aggregates have not been thoroughly characterized. We set up a new co&#8208;culture assay where &#8220;donor&#8221; CAD cells (loaded overnight with &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils) were co&#8208;cultured for 24&#160;h at the ratio of 1:1 with na&#239;ve &#8220;acceptor&#8221; CAD cells expressing GFP. In order to remove any membrane&#8208;bound extracellular &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils, donor cells were trypsin&#8208;washed before co&#8208;culture (Fig&#160;EV2A).</text>

      <text>To automatically detect and quantify the number and size of fibrillar &#945;&#8208;synuclein puncta in the donor and acceptor cell populations separately, we used confocal microscopy and developed a specific script of the ICY software (see Appendix and Fig&#160;EV3). By this method, we found that 100% of acceptor cells contained fibrillar &#945;&#8208;synuclein (Fig&#160;1B and C). Furthermore, to determine the efficiency of transfer, we quantified the number of fluorescent puncta in the donor and acceptor cell populations. While donor cells contained about 70 puncta per cell, acceptor cells contained 38 puncta (Fig&#160;1D) indicating that 35% of the puncta transferred from donor to acceptor cells. Together with the fact that 100% acceptor cells contained fibrillar &#945;&#8208;synuclein puncta, this shows that in our model cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell transfer of fibrillar &#945;&#8208;synuclein occurs and is very efficient.</text>

      <text>We next analysed the size of &#945;&#8208;synuclein puncta in donor and acceptor cells and found that the transferred puncta in acceptor cells correspond to smaller puncta (the median value is 0.15&#160;&#956;m3) than the ones within the donor cells (the median value is 0.42&#160;&#956;m3) (Fig&#160;1E).

      <text>We have previously demonstrated that &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils identical to those used in this study efficiently seed the aggregation of soluble reporter &#945;&#8208;synuclein (ChFP&#8208;&#945;&#8208;synuclein) when exogenously added to neuron&#8208;like cells in culture or in rodent (Bousset et&#160;al, 2013; Peelaerts et&#160;al, 2015). However, a key question is whether these fibrils would seed cytoplasmic reporter &#945;&#8208;synuclein, following their transfer from donor to acceptor cells. To address this question, we performed our co&#8208;culture experiment for 72&#160;h using as acceptor CAD cells stably overexpressing soluble ChFP&#8208;&#945;&#8208;synuclein (see schematic Fig&#160;EV2D). As expected for soluble &#945;&#8208;synuclein, in control conditions, ChFP&#8208;&#945;&#8208;synuclein cells cultured alone displayed a nucleocytoplasmic diffuse &#945;&#8208;synuclein signal with a few ChFP&#8208;&#945;&#8208;synuclein in discrete puncta, revealing low aggregation state of ChFP&#8208;&#945;&#8208;synuclein (Fig&#160;2A and B). In contrast, quantitative analysis revealed that after co&#8208;culture with donor cells loaded with &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils, acceptor cells contained a significantly higher number of endogenous ChFP&#8208;&#945;&#8208;synuclein in discrete puncta (4 and 15 &#945;&#8208;synuclein&#8208;ChFP puncta per acceptor cell in control and co&#8208;culture conditions, respectively) (Fig&#160;2A and B). In addition, 11% of the transferred Alexa&#8208;488 &#945;&#8208;synuclein co&#8208;localized with ChFP&#8208;&#945;&#8208;synuclein in discrete puncta (Fig&#160;2A and C). These results indicate that &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils are able to recruit soluble ChFP&#8208;&#945;&#8208;synuclein, suggesting that they retain their seeding activity after being transferred from donor to acceptor cells.</text>

      <text>To further characterize the mechanism of transfer, we first determined whether transferred &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils propagating from cell to cell co&#8208;localize with freshly taken up fibrils. Overnight co&#8208;cultures of donor (loaded with ATTO&#8208;550 &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils) and acceptor cells were exposed for additional 12&#160;h to &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils labelled with Alexa&#8208;488. As expected, exogenously added Alexa&#8208;488 &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils were taken up by both donor and acceptor cells with similar efficiency (Fig&#160;3A). Alexa&#8208;488 fibrils co&#8208;localized with the ATTO&#8208;550 fibrils in donor cells indicating that fibrils taken up initially (ATTO&#8208;550) and freshly taken up fibrils (Alexa&#8208;488) are directed to the same sub&#8208;cellular compartment (Fig&#160;3B). Intriguingly, however, while in donor cells we observed high co&#8208;localization percentage between ATTO&#8208;550&#8208; and Alexa&#8208;488&#8208;labelled fibrils (and reverse) (66&#160;&#177;&#160;0.66%), indicating that the two fibril batches were taken up following the same pathway (Fig&#160;3B), in acceptor cells the taken up (Alexa&#8208;488) and transferred fibrils (ATTO&#8208;550) from the donor population co&#8208;localized much less (16&#160;&#177;&#160;0.9%) (Fig&#160;3B). These data suggest that taken up and transferred fibrils in the acceptor cells may not undertake the same pathway.</text>

      <text>We further observed that the internalization of exogenous &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils is dependent on dynamin&#8208;1 as the expression of dominant&#8208;negative dynamin&#8208;1 (GFP&#8208;Dyn1 K44A) affected uptake (Fig&#160;EV4A and B).

      <text>To directly assess the role of secretion in the transfer, we loaded CAD cells with ATTO&#8208;550 fibrils for 16&#160;h and first assessed the amount of fibrils that remained within the cells and that were exported from the cells into the medium after 24&#160;h. Our quantitative assessment indicates that the proportion of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils taken up by cells within 16&#160;h is 2.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.5% (25&#8211;30&#160;nM internalized for 1&#160;&#956;M in total). The proportion of fibrillar &#945;&#8208;synuclein remaining in the cells and exported into the medium after 24&#8208;h incubation was 55 and 45&#160;&#177;&#160;5%, respectively (Fig&#160;3C). We then directly challenged the acceptor cell population with the 24&#8208;h conditioned medium (CM) of donor cells (Figs&#160;EV2B and 3D, panel CM). To faithfully mimic the condition of co&#8208;culture, the CM was not concentrated, diluted nor centrifuged. In this condition, the percentage of acceptor cells containing &#945;&#8208;synuclein puncta decreased substantially (28.3&#160;&#177;&#160;6.9% in CM condition compared to 100% in co&#8208;culture condition) (Fig&#160;3E, CM). Noteworthy, the decrease of fibril transfer was accompanied with a drastic decrease in the number of &#945;&#8208;synuclein puncta transferred per acceptor cell (i.e. less than two puncta per cell compared to 38 when direct contact was allowed) (Fig&#160;3F, CM).</text>

It is worth noting that this percentage was even more reduced than for the CM condition (17.4&#160;&#177;&#160;8.7% and 28.3&#160;&#177;&#160;6.9% in filter and CM conditions, respectively) (Fig&#160;3E). In these conditions, a 0.4&#8208;&#956;m membrane pore size semipermeable filter was used to prevent contact between donor and acceptor cells, but to allow the passage of soluble factors between the two cell populations (Gousset et&#160;al, 2009; Pasquier et&#160;al, 2012; Costanzo et&#160;al, 2013). One possibility to explain this result is that filters are impairing the passage of large cell debris contained in CM, which in turn will be responsible of the transfer observed in CM condition.</text>

      <text>Because tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) allow direct communication between cells and were found to play a role in the spreading of prions (and prion&#8208;like proteins) (Gousset et&#160;al, 2009; Wang et&#160;al, 2011; Costanzo et&#160;al, 2013; Ding et&#160;al, 2015), we next assessed the involvement of these structures in &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibril transfer. Noteworthy, cells exposed to &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils formed 20% more TNTs than control cells (Fig&#160;4A and B), indicating that fibrils can induce TNT formation. Interestingly, following uptake of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils, we observed a significant and persistent increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), which could contribute to the increase in the TNT number (Wang et&#160;al, 2011; Gousset et&#160;al, 2013) (Fig&#160;EV1D and E). Furthermore, as early as 16&#160;h after uptake, &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils were found in the lumen of TNTs between donor cells (Fig&#160;4C). Most importantly, in co&#8208;culture &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils were present inside TNTs that directly connect donor and acceptor cell populations (Fig&#160;4D). These results together with the data indicating that cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell contact contributes to the efficient &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibril transfer strongly support the implication of TNTs in this process.</text>

      <text>In order to directly assess the involvement of TNTs in &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibril transfer, we repeated the co&#8208;culture experiment in conditions enhancing or reducing TNT formation. We have previously shown that myosin&#8208;10 increases both TNT number and TNT&#8208;mediated unidirectional transfer of intracellular vesicles (Gousset et&#160;al, 2013). Therefore, we analysed whether overexpression of myosin&#8208;10 in donor cells would affect the transfer of the fibrils. As control, we verified that upon overexpression of myosin&#8208;10 there was an increase in TNT formation and in the amount of DiI&#8208;labelled vesicle transfer (Fig&#160;4E and F) and demonstrated that myosin&#8208;10 donor cells containing &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils formed 50% more TNTs (Fig&#160;4E). Noteworthy, after co&#8208;culturing donor cells overexpressing myosin&#8208;10 with acceptor cells for 24&#160;h, a statistically relevant 1.3&#8208;fold increase in the transfer of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils was observed as compared to control conditions (Fig&#160;4F). To further support the involvement of TNTs in &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibril transfer, we impaired TNT formation by plating co&#8208;cultured cells in sparse conditions. Indeed, in order to establish TNTs, cells are required to be in relative close contact (sub&#8208;confluent cells); therefore, in sparse conditions, the percentage of TNT&#8208;connected cells was drastically reduced (42.8&#160;&#177;&#160;12.2% versus 100% in sparse and sub&#8208;confluent conditions, respectively) (Fig&#160;4G). In these conditions, we observed a decrease in the percentage of acceptor cells containing &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils (38.5&#160;&#177;&#160;9.9% versus 100% in sparse and sub&#8208;confluent conditions, respectively) (Fig&#160;4H), which paralleled the decrease in TNT number. Altogether, these results clearly show that TNTs contribute to the intercellular transfer of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils.</text>

      <text>To determine whether &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils transfer through TNTs &#8220;naked&#8221; or embedded in vesicles, we first characterized the subcellular localization of fibrils in donor cells. As expected from previous studies showing that fibrils taken up from the medium are preferentially directed to the lysosomal compartment for degradation (Sung et&#160;al, 2001; Lee et&#160;al, 2008; Liu et&#160;al, 2009; Hasegawa et&#160;al, 2011; Konno et&#160;al, 2012), we found &#945;&#8208;synuclein puncta in the endolysosomal compartment (Fig&#160;5A left panel). Quantifications of co&#8208;localization (see the Appendix) revealed that almost 90% of fibrils localized within endolysosomal vesicles with the majority of fibrils found in lysosomes (16.7&#160;&#177;&#160;6.31% in EEA1&#8208;, 24.9&#160;&#177;&#160;0.52% in Vamp3&#8208; and 51.8&#160;&#177;&#160;3.08% in Lamp1&#8208;positive vesicles) (Fig&#160;5A right&#160;panel). Next, we investigated the subcellular localization of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils inside TNTs. Interestingly, the large bulk of fibrils&#160;in TNTs were found in Lamp1&#8208;positive vesicles and only rarely did they co&#8208;localized with markers of the early or recycling endosomes (Figs&#160;5B and EV5A and B), indicating that fibrils travel inside TNT&#8208;connecting cells preferentially confined in lysosomal vesicles.</text>

      <text>To examine the destiny of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils after TNT&#8208;mediated transfer (i.e. once they reached the acceptor cells), we performed similar co&#8208;localization studies and found that transferred fibrils predominantly co&#8208;localized with Lamp1&#8208;positive vesicles (28.7&#160;&#177; 3.37%) in acceptor cells (Fig&#160;5C). Only a few fibrils co&#8208;localized with EEA1&#8208; or Vamp3&#8208;positive vesicles (2.75&#160;&#177;&#160;0.55% and 5.13&#160;&#177; 1.56% for EEA1 and Vamp3, respectively) (Fig&#160;5C). These observations are consistent with the predominant lysosomal localization of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils in the TNT lumen and indicate that once transferred to acceptor cells, the majority of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils are confined inside lysosomal vesicles.</text>

      <text>Finally, in order to demonstrate that lysosomal vesicles containing &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils in acceptor cell came from donor cells (i.e.&#160;transfer), we pre&#8208;stained the lysosomes of donor cells with LysoTracker (i.e. lysosomotropic agent labelling lysosomal vesicles). After 24&#8208;h co&#8208;culture with acceptor cells, 100% of donor and acceptor cells contained LysoTracker&#8208;positive vesicles indicating transfer of lysosomes from donor to acceptor cells (Fig&#160;5D). Importantly, almost 80% of LysoTracker&#8208;positive vesicles co&#8208;localized with &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils in both donor and acceptor cells (76.2&#160;&#177;&#160;1.2% and 79.5&#160;&#177;&#160;0.9% for donor and acceptor cells, respectively) (Fig&#160;5E). These results clearly indicate that &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils in acceptor cells are inside lysosomes coming from donor cells. Consistent with this,&#160;transferred &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils did not co&#8208;localize with GFP&#8208;Rab7&#8208;labelled lysosomal vesicles of the acceptor cells (Fig&#160;EV5C).</text>

      <text>We next investigated &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibril transfer between primary cortical neurons. Firstly, we determined by quantitative confocal microscopy the proportion of primary cortical neurons (6 div) that internalized fluorescent &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils after 16&#160;h of incubation with two different fibril concentrations (0.5 and 1&#160;&#956;M). Internalization was very efficient and increased with the concentration of fibrils (around 75 and 100%, respectively) (Figs&#160;EV1F and 6A). Like in CAD cells, uptake of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils did not lead to an increase in LDH release over 72&#160;h as compared to control neurons (Fig&#160;EV1G). Cortical neurons take up &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils as early as 3 and up to 9&#160;days in&#160;vitro (div) (Appendix&#160;Fig S1); however, we chose to perform the transfer experiments with 1&#8208;week&#8208;old neurons given that it gave us the best balance between good cell maturity and density.</text>

      <text>To study neuron&#8208;to&#8208;neuron transfer of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils, &#8220;donor&#8221; neurons, exposed overnight to &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils (1&#160;&#956;M), were co&#8208;cultured with na&#239;ve freshly dissected &#8220;acceptor&#8221; CellTracker Green (CTG)&#8208;labelled neurons for 72&#160;h (Fig&#160;EV2F). Appropriate controls were included in every experiment in order to assess health of the young acceptor neurons (Appendix&#160;Fig S2). After 72&#8208;h co&#8208;culture, the number and size of puncta in both donor and acceptor cells were quantified by confocal microscopy using the same script of the ICY software employed for CAD cells (Appendix&#160;Fig S3). Note that because the acceptor neurons were pre&#8208;labelled in green with CTG, it was possible to easily discriminate them from the donor population (Appendix&#160;Figs S2 (lower panel) and S3). Under these experimental conditions, 94&#160;&#177;&#160;1.6% of acceptor neurons contained at least one &#945;&#8208;synuclein puncta (Fig&#160;6B and C). More precisely, while donor cells contained a median of 26 puncta, acceptor cells had a median of 7 puncta (Fig&#160;6D). Similar to CAD cells, the mean size of puncta in donor cells (the median value is 0.25&#160;&#956;m3) was larger than in acceptor cells (the median value is 0.17&#160;&#956;m3) (Fig&#160;6E). Taken together, these results indicate that healthy neurons are able to take up and efficiently transfer &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils to co&#8208;cultured neurons, in agreement with previous data (Freundt et&#160;al, 2012).</text>

      <text>To determine whether physical contacts between neurons favour the transfer of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils as is the case for CAD cells, we grew donor neurons, containing &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils, and CTG&#8208;labelled acceptor neurons on separated coverslips in the same Petri dish (Costanzo et&#160;al, 2013). Under our experimental conditions, the two populations of neurons share the same culture medium but establish no physical contacts (Fig&#160;7A, No contact). Quantitative confocal microscopy revealed that transfer of fibrillar &#945;&#8208;synuclein was significantly reduced under these conditions with only 3.1&#160;&#177;&#160;1.8% of the acceptor cells containing &#945;&#8208;synuclein puncta compared to co&#8208;culture conditions where cells could establish contacts (Fig&#160;7B and C).</text>

      <text>To assess the contribution of secretion of &#945;&#8208;synuclein from donor cells to the propagation process, we added the 72&#8208;h conditioned medium from donor neurons (loaded overnight with fluorescent &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils) to na&#239;ve acceptor neurons (Fig&#160;7A, CM). As in the case of CAD cells (Fig&#160;3C&#8211;E), the CM was not concentrated, diluted or centrifuged prior to its addition to acceptor cells. We found a significant decrease both in the percentage of acceptor cells containing &#945;&#8208;synuclein (30&#160;&#177;&#160;3%) and in the mean number of &#945;&#8208;synuclein puncta per cell (0.9) (Fig&#160;7B&#8211;D). We also analysed the presence of &#945;&#8208;synuclein in the 72&#8208;h CM of donor cells. By Western blots, we detected a strong &#945;&#8208;synuclein signal in the cell lysate of loaded neurons (overnight loading plus 72&#160;h) compared to control cells. We also detected &#945;&#8208;synuclein in the 72&#8208;h CM of loaded neurons, albeit this signal was quite low (Fig&#160;7E). Altogether, these&#160;results suggest that cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell contacts contribute to neuron&#8208;to&#8208;neuron transfer of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils.</text>

      <text>Because of the lack of a specific TNT marker, identification of TNTs in primary neurons is challenging. To determine whether TNTs are involved in the transfer of &#945;&#8208;synuclein from neurons to recipient cells, we co&#8208;cultured acceptor H2B&#8208;GFP&#8208;transfected CAD cells with mature donor neurons, pre&#8208;exposed overnight to fluorescent &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils. The proportion of the recipient cells containing &#945;&#8208;synuclein puncta was 100% after 24&#160;h of co&#8208;culture (Fig&#160;8A). Of interest, the number (the median value is 58) and average size (the median value is 0.14&#160;&#956;m3) of &#945;&#8208;synuclein foci were very similar to the number and size found in the acceptor cells upon cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated transfer of fibrillar &#945;&#8208;synuclein between CAD cells (compare Fig&#160;8B to Fig&#160;1D and E). Most importantly, under these conditions we could identify TNTs extending between CAD cells and the soma and neurites of primary cortical neurons and in some cases TNTs containing &#945;&#8208;synuclein puncta (Fig&#160;8C). We conclude from these observations that TNT&#8208;mediated cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell contacts contribute to the transfer of fibrillar &#945;&#8208;synuclein.</text>

      <text>While the transfer of &#945;&#8208;synuclein between co&#8208;cultured cells in&#160;vitro has been convincingly demonstrated, the nature of the transferred &#945;&#8208;synuclein and the mechanism of transfer have not been defined (Desplats et&#160;al, 2009; Danzer et&#160;al, 2011; Hansen et&#160;al, 2011; Freundt et&#160;al, 2012; Bae et&#160;al, 2014). Characterizing both these issues is critical for designing strategies aimed at interfering with the propagation component of the pathology. To address this, we assessed the intercellular transfer of well&#8208;characterized recombinant human fluorescent &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils of defined structure and molecular mass proven to induce Lewy body&#8208;like inclusion in rat (Peelaerts et&#160;al, 2015), in co&#8208;culture of CAD cells and primary neurons. To our knowledge, our study is the first evidencing high levels of transfer in neuronal&#8208;like cells and in primary neurons (100% of acceptor cells compared to on average 2&#8211;10% for equal or longer duration of co&#8208;culture) (Desplats et&#160;al, 2009; Hansen et&#160;al, 2011; Bae et&#160;al, 2014). This may be attributed to the nature of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils used in our study as opposed to polymorphic preparations and overexpressed &#945;&#8208;synuclein (which does not appear to form disease&#8208;associated fibrillar aggregates) used in previous studies (Desplats et&#160;al, 2009; Hansen et&#160;al, 2011; Bae et&#160;al, 2014). In addition using confocal microscopy combined with a dedicated plugin for quantitative image analysis, we could document both the number and size of transferred &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils, which has been proven very challenging using manual methods (Desplats et&#160;al, 2009; Danzer et&#160;al, 2011; Hansen et&#160;al, 2011; Kondo et&#160;al, 2011; Freundt et&#160;al, 2012; Konno et&#160;al, 2012; Lee et&#160;al, 2013; Bae et&#160;al, 2014).</text>

      <text>We demonstrate that cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell contacts contribute to efficient transfer of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils in CAD cells and primary neurons. This is in agreement with a recent elegant in&#160;vivo study showing that in mice the intercellular transfer of &#945;&#8208;synuclein from the olfactory bulb to other brain regions was likely not due to passive diffusion through cerebrospinal fluid or brain parenchyma, but rather relied on cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell contacts (Rey et&#160;al, 2013). Impairing cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell contact in our model systems (both in CAD cells and in primary cortical neurons) reduced the transfer of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils. Transfer through conditioned media was not as efficient as that through donor cells physically contacting recipient cells. Previous studies where the conditioned medium was concentrated (200X) suggested secretion as a major path for &#945;&#8208;synuclein transfer (Desplats et&#160;al, 2009; Hansen et&#160;al, 2011; Bae et&#160;al, 2014). While secretion in the medium contributes to propagation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils, physical contacts between cells significantly increased transfer. This means that either physical contacts between cells or tight proximity is essential for efficient transfer of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils.&#160;It is also worth noting that studies in&#160;vivo have demonstrated lower levels of the secreted &#945;&#8208;synuclein protein in the cerebrospinal fluid in PD subjects compared to control subjects (Tokuda et&#160;al, 2006).</text>

      <text>Uptake of preformed &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils has been shown to be partially dependent on dynamin (Hansen et&#160;al, 2011; Konno et&#160;al, 2012; Reyes et&#160;al, 2014). To assess the contribution of dynamin&#8208;dependent processes on fibrillar &#945;&#8208;synuclein transfer, we overexpressed the dominant&#8208;negative form of dynamin&#8208;1 in the acceptor CAD cells. We confirmed that uptake of exogenous fibrils is partially dynamin&#8208;1 dependent. However, the overexpression of dominant&#8208;negative forms of dynamin&#8208;1 did not affect the cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell transfer of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils. Previous studies employed donor cells overexpressing &#945;&#8208;synuclein, which does not appear to form aggregates and was reported to be secreted. Significantly, we found that in acceptor cells taken up &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils co&#8208;localized little with fibrils transferred from donor cells, which suggest that fibrils may use different pathways to be internalized or to transfer between neuron&#8208;like cells in our co&#8208;culture conditions.</text>

      <text>By analysing three dimensionally reconstructed confocal images, we observed &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils in the lumen of TNT&#8208;connecting donor and acceptor CAD cells. Importantly, the transfer of fibrils was greatly increased when TNT formation was enhanced by overexpression of the TNT inducer myosin&#8208;10 (Gousset et&#160;al, 2013), while it decreased when TNT formation was impaired (i.e. in sparse conditions or using physical barriers). This suggests that TNTs contribute to intercellular transfer of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils. Interestingly, we found that &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils enhance TNT formation. The mechanism for this increase needs to be further studied; however, we report a sustained increase in ROS, which could account for this observation. We have previously reported that oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide) induces TNT formation in CAD cells (Gousset et&#160;al, 2013). Thus, &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils may induce TNT formation through ROS and hijack this process to spread efficiently. In support of this hypothesis, Wang and colleagues have shown that rat astrocytes, subjected to oxidative stress, form TNTs to selectively connect with na&#239;ve unstressed cells (Wang et&#160;al, 2011). We propose that this should favour the oriented propagation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregates from stressed, aggregate&#8208;containing cells, to healthy counterparts, and could explain (in part) the topographical and stereotypical spreading of &#945;&#8208;synuclein inclusions described in the Braak staging (Braak et&#160;al, 2003b). Consistent with this view, myosin&#8208;10 both enhances the unidirectional transfer of vesicles through TNTs (Gousset et&#160;al, 2013) and increases the number of fibrils transferred in acceptor cells. These observations suggest that intercellular transfer of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils through TNTs is mainly unidirectional (from donor stressed cells to unstressed acceptor cells).</text>

      <text>How &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils are transported in TNTs and to what compartment are they directed to after they reach the acceptor cells are important questions. Endogenous &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregates are targeted to lysosomes both in&#160;vivo and in cell models (Cuervo et&#160;al, 2004; Spencer et&#160;al, 2009; Mak et&#160;al, 2010), suggesting an important role of the autophagic and lysosomal pathways in the degradation of misfolded proteinaceous aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases (Zhang et&#160;al, 2009; Nixon, 2013). We found the majority of preformed &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils inside lysosomal vesicles in donor cells (Sung et&#160;al, 2001; Lee et&#160;al, 2008; Liu et&#160;al, 2009; Konno et&#160;al, 2012). We further discovered that fibrils are transported to acceptor cells in the lumen of TNTs within lysosomal vesicles. The finding that &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils traffic inside lysosomes in TNTs is reminiscent of other studies reporting a TNT&#8208;dependent mechanism of lysosome transfer in both healthy and pathological conditions (Rustom et&#160;al, 2004; Gousset et&#160;al, 2009; Yasuda et&#160;al, 2011; Naphade et&#160;al, 2015). Of specific interest, in the context of a lysosomal disorder, Naphade and colleagues have shown that damaged lysosomes are transferred from diseased fibroblasts towards healthy macrophages (Naphade et&#160;al, 2015). Interestingly, &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregation has been shown to cause lysosomal dysfunction in&#160;vivo and in&#160;vitro (Chu et&#160;al, 2009; Dehay et&#160;al, 2010; Alvarez&#8208;Erviti et&#160;al, 2011). This appears to be very relevant for PD pathology, which is associated with lysosomal dysfunctions (Bourdenx et&#160;al, 2014). In our cell models (CAD cells and primary neurons), &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils accumulate in lysosomal vesicles. We further observed an increase in the lysosome size similar to what was reported in &#945;&#8208;synuclein&#8208;induced lysosomal dysfunction (Tanik et&#160;al, 2013). Based on these findings, we formulate the hypothesis that donor cells overloaded with damaged lysosomes containing &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils dispose of this material by transferring it in a &#8220;targeted way&#8221; to healthy cells by hijacking the trafficking of TNT&#8208;mediated lysosomal vesicles (see model, Fig&#160;9). This hypothesis is fully supported by and explains the evidence in the literature showing that lysosomal impairment increases the transfer of &#945;&#8208;synuclein between cells (Bae et&#160;al, 2014). TNTs may also be involved in the oriented transfer of aggregated &#945;&#8208;synuclein from neurons to astrocytes. The latter have been indeed&#160;shown to take up and concentrate very efficiently fibrillar &#945;&#8208;synuclein (Reyes et&#160;al, 2014).</text>

      <text>Once internalized in donor cells (A), recombinant human &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils are mainly targeted to lysosomal vesicles (and found to a lesser extend in early and recycling endosomes). Lysosomal vesicles containing &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils transfer from donor to acceptor cells (B) inside TNTs. Once in the acceptor cells, &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils induce the formation of de novo &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregates (seeding). We propose that (A) &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils accumulated inside lysosomes would impair their function leading to cellular stress (e.g. oxidative stress). In turn, this would induce TNT formation allowing spread to (B) healthy cells in order to lower the burden of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils inside lysosomes. &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils would then escape lysosomes possibly by inducing LMP. Once free in the cytoplasm, they would recruit soluble &#945;&#8208;synuclein and induce de novo formation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregates. As a consequence, &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils would propagate from stressed to unstressed cells through TNTs contributing to the intercellular spreading of the pathology. Because endogenous &#945;&#8208;synuclein when aggregated is targeted to lysosomes in&#160;vivo, we propose a similar mechanism occurring for endogenously formed aggregates (C).</text>

      <text>In order to propagate the pathology, &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils have to amplify after transfer by seeding the aggregation of their soluble counterpart. While several reports have demonstrated a seeding activity of the transferred &#945;&#8208;synuclein (with 2&#8211;5% of inclusion formation upon co&#8208;culture of neuronal cells), none has so far identified the species of &#945;&#8208;synuclein responsible for seeding after transfer (Desplats et&#160;al, 2009; Lee et&#160;al, 2010; Hansen et&#160;al, 2011; Angot et&#160;al, 2012; Bae et&#160;al, 2014). As the majority of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils are confined within lysosomes, how &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils seed the aggregation of their cytosolic counterpart becomes intriguing. &#945;&#8208;synuclein assemblies have been previously shown to induce the rupture of lysosomes in&#160;vitro (Freeman et&#160;al, 2013) and lysosomal membrane permeation (LMP) has been reported in a mouse model of PD (Dehay et&#160;al, 2010). The &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils used in this study were shown to permeabilize membranes (Pieri et&#160;al, 2012). Based on these evidences, we propose that seeding may be the consequence of lysosomal rupture and release of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils into the cytosol (see model, Fig&#160;9). Further studies are required to determine whether this occurs or how &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils escape the lysosomal vesicles during or after TNT&#8208;mediated transfer.</text>

      <text>We demonstrated here that TNTs contribute significantly to intercellular &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibril transfer and evidenced a specific role of lysosomes in this process. This represents a major breakthrough in understanding the mechanisms underlying the progression of synucleinopathies. Furthermore, our work has revealed a novel role of lysosomes for intercellular spreading of &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregates and calls for a re&#8208;evaluation of lysosome function in neurodegenerative diseases. Similar to &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils, huntingtin (Costanzo et&#160;al, 2013), PrPSc (Gousset &amp; Zurzolo, 2009; Gousset et&#160;al, 2009; Zhu et&#160;al, 2015) and TDP&#8208;43 (Ding et&#160;al, 2015) aggregates were shown to induce TNT formation and to propagate from cell to cell through TNTs. Our compelling findings together with previous reports allow us to propose a general role for TNTs in the propagation of prion&#8208;like proteins in neurodegenerative diseases (Gousset et&#160;al, 2009; Wang et&#160;al, 2011; Costanzo et&#160;al, 2013; Ding et&#160;al, 2015). The discovery of specific TNT markers is paramount to investigate the involvement of TNT&#8208;mediated transfer in&#160;vivo. Such studies could open new avenues for the discovery of therapeutic targets and the development of innovative drugs to prevent the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.</text>
