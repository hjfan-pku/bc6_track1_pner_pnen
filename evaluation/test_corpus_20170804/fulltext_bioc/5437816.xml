      <text>Autophagy is a cellular surveillance pathway that balances metabolic and energy resources and transports specific cargos, including damaged mitochondria, other broken organelles, or pathogens for degradation to the lysosome. Central components of autophagosomal biogenesis are six members of the LC3 and GABARAP family of ubiquitin&#8208;like proteins (mATG8s). We used phage display to isolate peptides that possess bona fide LIR (LC3&#8208;interacting region) properties and are selective for individual mATG8 isoforms. Sensitivity of the developed sensors was optimized by multiplication, charge distribution, and fusion with a membrane recruitment (FYVE) or an oligomerization (PB1) domain. We demonstrate the use of the engineered peptides as intracellular sensors that recognize specifically GABARAP, GABL1, GABL2, and LC3C, as well as a bispecific sensor for LC3A and LC3B. By using an LC3C&#8208;specific sensor, we were able to monitor recruitment of endogenous LC3C to Salmonella during xenophagy, as well as to mitochondria during mitophagy. The sensors are general tools to monitor the fate of mATG8s and will be valuable in decoding the biological functions of the individual LC3/GABARAPs.</text>

      <text>Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular pathway important for adaptation to stressful conditions, including starvation, pathogen invasion, protein aggregation, and oxidative stress (for a review, see Kroemer et&#160;al, 2010; Ohsumi, 2014). Under basal conditions, autophagy is dedicated to the continuous renewal of the intracellular pool of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and organelles, and thus also plays a critical role in cellular homeostasis (Klionsky &amp; Codogno, 2013). While autophagy originally had been described as a non&#8208;selective bulk process induced in response to starvation, it is now recognized that the degradation of damaged organelles, removal of protein aggregates, and elimination of intracellular pathogens are highly selective and tightly regulated processes that require cargo recognition and processing by the autophagic machinery (Stolz et&#160;al, 2014; Ktistakis &amp; Tooze, 2016). To fulfill these diverse functions, the autophagic machinery includes adapters as well as cargo receptors, which are specific for individual selective autophagy pathways (Rogov et&#160;al, 2014; Stolz et&#160;al, 2014). Common for these two functional classes is their interaction with the central autophagy component ATG8 via their ATG8&#8208;interacting motif (AIM), also called LC3&#8208;interacting region (LIR) (Rogov et&#160;al, 2014). Members of the ATG8 family [six in humans: LC3A, LC3B, LC3C, GABARAP, GABARAPL1, and GABARAPL2; later referred to as mammalian ATG8s (mATG8s), or as LC3s and GABARAPs when&#160;referring to individual subfamilies] are ubiquitin&#8208;like (UBL) proteins, which can be covalently modified with phosphatidylethanolamine resulting in their association with intracellular membranous structures (Kabeya et&#160;al, 2000). Although mATG8s are known to be crucial for the formation of functional isolation membranes (autophagic membrane that isolates cargo from cytosol) and subsequently autophagosomes by providing a binding platform for autophagy adaptors and receptors, little is known about the overlapping and specific functions of the individual family members (Rubinsztein et&#160;al, 2012). LC3/GABARAPs also have distinct, non&#8208;overlapping intracellular localization and varying expression levels in different cell types and tissues (Le Grand et&#160;al, 2013; Hiyama et&#160;al, 2015; Koukourakis et&#160;al, 2015).</text>

      <text>To date, GABARAPs were shown to be involved in intra&#8208;Golgi transport and Golgi re&#8208;assembly (Sagiv et&#160;al, 2000; Muller et&#160;al, 2002; Leil et&#160;al, 2004). Different functions for the LC3 and GABARAP subfamilies were subsequently described during the early and late stages of autophagosome formation, respectively (Weidberg et&#160;al, 2010). However, this functional difference between the two mATG8 subfamilies is not strict, as some early steps of the initiation of autophagy seem to be also dependent on GABARAPs (Alemu et&#160;al, 2012).</text>

      <text>Even though some earlier studies reported specificity of mATG8 isoforms in selective autophagy pathways (Novak et&#160;al, 2010; von Muhlinen et&#160;al, 2012), only in recent years an increasing number of studies have concentrated on their individual characteristics and functions. Consistent with acting at later stages of autophagy, GABARAPs seem to be involved in facilitating membrane fusion (McEwan et&#160;al, 2015; Wang et&#160;al, 2015; Landajuela et&#160;al, 2016). Presumably, LC3s are more important for recruitment of cytosolic receptors, while GABARAPs in general facilitate transport and recruitment of membrane&#8208;bound factors (Sagiv et&#160;al, 2000; Muller et&#160;al, 2002; Leil et&#160;al, 2004; Genau et&#160;al, 2015; Joachim et&#160;al, 2015).</text>

      <text>One reason for the limitations to study individual mATG8s on endogenous level is the lack of appropriate tools, such as isoform&#8208;specific antibodies or sensors. Gene replacement and tagging of endogenous proteins is becoming easier with recent developments in the CRISPR technology (Kaulich et&#160;al, 2015), but this technique needs to be applied to each studied cell line individually. Additionally, off&#8208;targets on the genomic level and effects of even small tags on the protein function can never be completely excluded. We therefore aimed to create a set of fluorescent sensors that target individual mATG8s and would be applicable in all kinds of cell lines. By utilizing binding domains of known interactors, we and others have previously generated a set of chain&#8208;specific ubiquitin sensors (Fig&#160;1A) (Sims et&#160;al, 2012; van Wijk et&#160;al, 2012). In order to create specific sensors for individual mATG8 homologues, we used an unbiased peptide phage display approach to identify peptides that specifically bind mammalian ATG8 isoforms with high affinity. Peptide phage display is a powerful approach to identify specificity profiles of protein domains that recognize linear peptide motifs, and has been used to map the binding specificity of PDZ, SH3, and WW domains (Tonikian et&#160;al, 2008, 2009; Fowler et&#160;al, 2010). Additionally, it has been shown that peptide phage display has a high level of sensitivity that is able to detect the influence of single point mutations on the peptide&#8208;binding profile of an engineered PDZ domain (Ernst et&#160;al, 2009, 2010). Here, we report the development of engineered peptides, which selectively bind individual mATG8s in&#160;vitro and in&#160;vivo. Starting from a first generation of ATG8 sensors (AS), we established different strategies to generate a second and third generation of improved sensors. As a proof of concept, we show that LC3C sensors are specifically recruited to mitochondria and Salmonella during mitophagy and xenophagy pathways, respectively.</text>

      <text>The mammalian ATG8 family contains six members divided into two subfamilies: LC3s (LC3A, LC3B, LC3C) and GABARAPs [GABARAP; GABARAPL1 (GABL1); GABARAPL2/GATE 16 (GABL2)]. Using peptide phage display, we aimed to create a toolbox of peptides, which bind specifically to individual mATG8s. Initially, a library of random 16&#8208;mer peptides fused to the M13 major coat protein p8 was constructed. The resulting library consisted of a pool of approximately 1011 unique phage particles, each displaying multiple copies of an individual peptide on its surface (Fig&#160;1B). Display of numerous peptides on the major coat protein p8 results in a strong avidity effect that allows the selection of highly specific peptides optimized for binding to individual mATG8 proteins (Sidhu et&#160;al, 2000). To avoid cross&#8208;reactivity of the resulting peptides, the phage pools have been extensively pre&#8208;adsorbed on the five remaining, non&#8208;cognate mATG8 family members, followed by positive selection on the targeted mATG8 isoform (Fig&#160;1B). After selections, individual phage clones displaying peptide copies with a unique sequence were analyzed by ELISA for their binding specificity toward individual mATG8 family members and sequenced (representative ELISA results shown in Fig&#160;1C).</text>

      <text>To further analyze in&#160;vitro binding selectivity of the engineered peptides, all identified peptides from p8 display were cloned as mTurquoise fusion proteins in a mammalian expression vector and subjected to pull&#8208;down analysis (Fig&#160;1D and Appendix&#160;Fig S1). For control and comparison, we added in our analysis peptides comprising LIR motifs from two known autophagy receptors, p62 and NDP52 (Table&#160;EV1). NDP52 is known to specifically bind to LC3C as a full&#8208;length protein (von Muhlinen et&#160;al, 2012). However, the peptide containing the LIR of NDP52 bound weakly to all GST&#8208;tagged mATG8s to a similar extent (Fig&#160;1D). Similarly, the p62 LIR peptide was shown to interact with all mATG8s, albeit with apparently much stronger affinity (Fig&#160;1D) (Birgisdottir et&#160;al, 2013). This observation indicates that additional binding surfaces adjacent to the LIR could be required to mediate specific binding of autophagy receptors and adaptors to individual mATG8s. Such a mechanism to mediate specificity to GABARAP has been already described for ALFY (Lystad et&#160;al, 2014). In contrast to the control p62 peptide that binds to all six isoforms in the pull&#8208;down experiment, we identified 34 peptides with varying degrees of specificity to individual mATG8s (Fig&#160;1D and Appendix&#160;Fig S1). Notably, the fluorophore&#8208;fused peptides showed higher levels of selectivity in pull&#8208;down experiments compared to the ELISA with peptides displayed on the phage surface (compare Fig&#160;1C and D). Based on their in&#160;vitro binding specificities, we have selected 13 peptides targeting individual mATG8 for further cellular and functional studies (Table&#160;EV1).</text>

      <text>In a next step, we tested the specificity of selected peptides in a cellular environment. For this purpose, we applied an annexin A4&#8208;driven membrane co&#8208;translocation assay (Piljic &amp; Schultz, 2008). The engineered peptides were fused to the C&#8208;terminus of an annexin A4&#8208;mCherry (A4&#8208;mCh) module and co&#8208;expressed with individual EGFP&#8208;mATG8s devoid of the C&#8208;terminal Gly residue required for lipidation. The A4&#8208;mCh&#8211;peptide fusion is recruited to membranes upon ionomycin&#8208;induced calcium influx and causes co&#8208;translocation of the EGFP&#8208;mATG8 in case there is interaction between the two molecules (Fig&#160;2A). As a positive control, we used the interaction between A4&#8208;mCh&#8208;AS_p62 peptide and EGFP&#8208;LC3B (Fig&#160;EV1A). Three out of all tested peptides gave rise to a comparable or better co&#8208;recruitment of their target mATG8 when compared to the p62&#8208;derived peptide&#8211;LC3B interaction (Figs&#160;2B and EV1A).</text>

      <text>It has been shown previously that negatively charged residues in close proximity to the core LIR motif improve binding toward LC3s (Wild et&#160;al, 2011). In order to test whether introduction of negatively charged amino acids upstream of the binding motif would improve the performance of the sensor, we focused on the LC3C&#8208;specific peptide AS_67 as a model system (Table&#160;EV1). First, we performed a peptide array analysis via a single amino acid walk&#8208;through with octameric peptides along the complete 16&#8208;mer. In this assay, we identified a CLIR&#8208;like motif &#8220;TIVI&#8221; to be essential for interaction with LC3C (Fig&#160;2D) (von Muhlinen et&#160;al, 2012). Subsequently, we mutated the original peptide sequence SFTMYEPDQQTIVIES (AS_67) to SFTMYEPDDDTIVIES (AS_M67), to provide additional negative charges N&#8208;terminal to the core CLIR&#8208;like motif. The AS_M67&#8208;based A4&#8208;mCh construct (containing only a single copy of the modified peptide) resulted in improved co&#8208;translocation of LC3C comparable to AS3_67 (Figs&#160;2E and F, and EV1C). Also in the presence of additional negative charges, the CLIR&#8208;like motif &#8220;TIVI&#8221; remained the necessary determinant of AS_M67 binding to LC3C (Fig&#160;2D).</text>

      <text>As the p8&#8208;derived peptides directed against LC3A and LC3B (AS_32, AS_55, AS_57, AS_59, AS_61, AS_63) did not show translocation in the annexin A4&#8208;based assay (Table&#160;EV1), we performed additional phage display selections with increased selection stringency and an altered pre&#8208;adsorption strategy. In the first step, we constructed a fully randomized 12&#8208;mer peptide library displayed on M13 minor coat protein p3 (instead of p8), resulting in the display of only 1&#8211;3 peptide copies on the phage surface (Fig&#160;1B). This library with a diversity of 1010 was used to select against LC3A and LC3B with pre&#8208;adsorption only on GABARAPs and LC3C. With this approach, we favor the selection of peptides that are bispecific for LC3A and LC3B, the two closest family members that share ~80% identity. In this way, we identified a new peptide, named AS_AB2, which showed preferential binding to LC3A and LC3B in pull&#8208;down assays (Table&#160;EV1). This peptide was not analyzed in the annexin assay, but directly tested for recruitment to LC3A/LC3B&#8208;positive autophagosomes (Table&#160;EV1 and see below).</text>

      <text>In summary, both strategies&#8212;the triplication of the peptide and charge optimization adjacent to the LIR motif&#8212;are suited for enhancing binding between peptides and mATG8s, by either inducing avidity or increasing affinity, respectively. Our results show that the engineered peptides can discriminate between mATG8s in the cellular environment. Additionally, their interaction strength is sufficient to follow ATG8 trafficking during autophagy, making them suitable for the generation of ATG8 sensors.</text>

      <text>As a starting point for our in vivo sensor development, we compared the localization of selected peptides in cells overexpressing individual EGFP&#8208;tagged mATG8s or endogenous mATG8s under basal and autophagy&#8208;stimulated conditions (3 h KU&#8208;0063784&#160;+&#160;bafilomycin A1 treatment, later referred to as KU&#160;+&#160;Baf). As control, we used the triplicate repeat of the p62&#8208;derived peptide fused to mCherry (mCh&#8208;AS3_p62; Fig&#160;3 and Table&#160;EV1) as a sensor for LC3B. While overexpressed EGFP&#8208;LC3B as well as the p62&#8208;derived sensor remained mainly cytosolic in non&#8208;stimulated cells, they were co&#8208;recruited to autophagosomes upon autophagy stimulation (Fig&#160;3A). Importantly, mCh&#8208;AS3_p62 was also recruited to autophagosomes when LC3B was present only on endogenous levels (Fig&#160;3B), suggesting that the sensor approach is widely applicable and not limited to overexpressed target proteins.</text>

      <text>To ensure that recruitment of the sensor to autophagosomes was indeed dependent on its interaction with mATG8s and to rule out that the sensor was recruited to autophagosomes in some other non&#8208;specific way, we performed a similar analysis in WT and Atg5 KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). ATG5 is a key player in the lipidation process of LC3B, and cells lacking this protein fail to form ATG8&#8208;positive autophagosomes (Kuma et&#160;al, 2004). While endogenous Lc3b was recruited to autophagosomes in WT MEFs upon autophagy stimulation, it remained cytosolic in Atg5 KO cells (Fig&#160;3C). Similarly, mCh&#8208;AS3_p62 remained cytosolic in Atg5 KO cells after autophagy induction, indicating Atg8 dependency for its recruitment to autophagosomes (Fig&#160;3C).</text>

      <text>Further tests on mCh&#8208;AS3_p62 revealed that the sensor preferentially recognizes LC3A&#8208;, LC3B&#8208;, and GABARAPL2&#8208;positive autophagosomes in cells (Fig&#160;EV3A and B). This preference for a subset of mATG8s in a cellular environment was not predictable from our in&#160;vitro pull&#8208;down analysis, where AS_p62 bound all six mATG8s to a similar extent (Fig&#160;1D). It is important to note that endogenous LC3B is continuously present in the cell lines used and contributes to the recruitment of the sensor to autophagosomes positive for overexpressed ATG8s. It is therefore possible that the specificity of this sensor for LC3A and LC3B is higher than the evaluation presented in Fig&#160;EV3B suggests.</text>

Substitution of the four LIR residues by alanine in our p62&#8208;derived sensor resulted in the construct mCh&#8208;AS3_&#8710;LIRp62 (Table&#160;EV1). This construct was no longer recruited to autophagosomes labeled with overexpressed LC3B (Figs&#160;3D and EV3B), demonstrating the LIR dependence of the p62&#8208;derived sensor mCh&#8208;AS3_p62.</text>

      <text>In the next step, we tested whether the engineered isoform&#8208;specific sensors are also recruited to autophagosomes that are positive for their respective target mATG8 after autophagy induction. We transiently co&#8208;transfected individual mCherry sensors (AS3_AB2, AS3_67, AS_M67, AS3_99, and AS3_30) with respective target EGFP&#8208;mATG8s in HeLa cells and tested whether the sensors were recruited to mATG8&#8208;positive autophagosomes. Individual sensors showed recruitment to autophagosomes positive for their overexpressed target mATG8 (Fig&#160;3E and F). The most prominent example was AS3_67, a specific sensor for LC3C, that at low intracellular abundance was recruited to EGFP&#8208;LC3C&#8208;positive autophagosomes, while it did not recognize any other overexpressed EGFP&#8208;ATG8 (Figs&#160;3D, and EV3A and B).</text>

      <text>Unfortunately, not all sensors showed such strong binding to their cognate modifiers in cells. Possible reasons are either their instability in cellular environment, insufficient affinity toward their target mATG8, or mislocalization of sensor to distinct structures under resting condition (Figs&#160;3 and EV3C and G). For the GABARAPL1 sensor AS3_99, the used assay (KU&#160;+&#160;Baf treatment) does not seem to be the optimal condition to validate performance of the sensor: Overexpressed EGFP&#8208;GABARAPL1 remained mainly cytosolic and failed to accumulate primarily on autophagosomes after autophagy induction by KU (Fig&#160;3F). In another instance, the sensor AS3_30 was recruited to GABARAPL2&#8208;positive structures in only few highly expressing cells (Fig&#160;3F), but its consistent recruitment failed in a stable inducible cell line with low expression levels of the sensor. Further analysis revealed that the peptide AS_30 binds GABARAPL2 with 0.8&#160;&#956;M affinity in&#160;vitro, but AS3_30 undergoes rapid degradation by the proteasome, potentially driven by its unstructured C&#8208;terminal peptide part (Fig&#160;EV3C&#8211;E).</text>

      <text>Based on these results, we reasoned that a shortened peptide would be less sensitive to proteasomal degradation. The identification of the minimal core motif in AS_30 in a peptide&#8208;binding assay (Fig&#160;EV3F) showed that a 10&#8208;mer is sufficient to mediate binding to GABARAPL2. To further decrease the probability of creating a &#8220;loose end&#8221; that is recognized by the proteasome (Beskow et&#160;al, 2009; Verhoef et&#160;al, 2009), we used only a duplicate, not a triple repeat, of the peptide. Additionally, the affinity of the shortened peptide to GABARAPL2 was further increased by introduction of negatively charged amino acids close to the predicted LIR&#8208;like binding motif. The resulting sensor was named AS2_10M30 (Table&#160;EV1). This optimized sensor was well expressed in cells and specifically recruited to its target GABARAPL2 (Figs&#160;3F and EV3A and B). In summary, our experiments demonstrate that the development of mATG8&#8208;isoform&#8208;specific sensor is feasible and that the sensors can be used to trace individual mATG8s in cells.</text>

      <text>Since mATG8s have central functions in the initiation and formation of autophagosomes, a peptide&#8208;based sensor could act as a competitor preventing binding of endogenous proteins to mATG8s. This could negatively influence the autophagy flux, for example, by blocking binding sites important for mATG8 lipidation. To address this question, we performed autophagy flux assays under basal and&#160;autophagy&#8208;stimulated conditions in stable, doxycycline (DOX)&#8208;inducible cell lines expressing the p62&#8208;derived sensor mCherry&#8208;AS3_p62 or the LC3C&#8208;specific sensor mCherry&#8208;AS3_67. To eliminate possible effects resulting from mCherry overexpression or DOX treatment, we generated a control cell line expressing the LIR&#8208;defective version of the p62&#8208;derived sensor, AS3_&#8710;LIRp62, which does not bind mATG8s. DOX treatment in the cell line expressing the control construct mCherry&#8208;AS3_&#8710;LIRp62 had no effect on LC3B lipidation (LC3B II) under basal and autophagy&#8208;induced conditions (Figs&#160;4A&#8211;C, EV4 and EV5). However, block of lysosomal degradation with bafilomycin A1 led to faster accumulation of p62 and LC3B I indicating accelerated basal and starvation&#8208;induced autophagy flux upon DOX&#8208;induced protein expression (Fig&#160;EV5). Taking these observations into account, the p62&#8208;derived sensor mCherry&#8208;AS3_p62 and sensor mCh&#8208;AS3_67 did not inhibit autophagy flux (Figs&#160;4A&#8211;C, EV4 and EV5). While the LC3C&#8208;specific sensor mCh&#8208;AS3_67 only marginally affected p62 turnover, sensor mCh&#8208;AS3_p62 clearly delayed p62 degradation indicating competition between the sensor and p62 for endogenous ATG8s.</text>

We used an assay that is based on the pH&#8208;dependent changes in mKeima fluorescence during mitophagy induced by oligomycin/antimycin A (Bingol et&#160;al, 2014; Lazarou et&#160;al, 2015). Fused to a mitochondrial localization signal, the changes in mKeima&#8208;fluorescence emission allow tracking of the translocation of damaged mitochondria from the cytosol to the lysosome by FACS: In an environment at pH 7, mKeima has an excitation maximum at 438&#160;nm, whereas at pH 4 the maximum shifts to 550&#160;nm. None of the stably expressed sensors had a significant effect on mitophagy flux over a period of 6&#160;h, suggesting that they do not block the endogenous mitophagy machinery (Fig&#160;4D). Taken together, the engineered mATG8&#8208;specific sensors detect mATG8&#8208;positive autophagosomes, but they do not seem to affect the endogenous machinery that controls autophagy flux.</text>

      <text>A stable HeLa cell line expressing mCh&#8208;AS3_67 upon DOX treatment was infected with the Salmonella strain SFH2. The genome of Salmonella SFH2 carries GFP as a reporter gene under the control of the uhpT promoter (Wild et&#160;al, 2011). Upon escape of bacteria from Salmonella&#8208;containing vacuoles (SCVs) into the cytosol, expression of the reporter gene is activated due to the presence of glucose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate in the host's cytosol. This enables the specific identification of cytosolic bacteria, which are in principle accessible to the autophagic machinery. Analysis by fluorescence microscopy of cells at an early infection stage (up to 90&#160;min after infection) showed that we could capture the event of Salmonella escaping SCVs. Sensor mCh&#8208;AS3_67 was very efficiently recruited to bacteria during these early events (Fig&#160;5A): In five HeLa cells that contained Salmonella in the process of turning GFP&#8208;positive (low GFP signal; Fig&#160;5B, white arrow), all pathogen cells were labeled with mCh&#8208;AS3_67. This signal overlapped with the signal of endogenous LC3C (Fig&#160;5B, lower panels). Two cells contained more than only one Salmonella cell (i.e., five and eight bacteria, respectively). In these HeLa cells, sensor&#8208;negative bacteria had already developed a bright green color, indicating prolonged residence in the cytosol (Fig&#160;5B, compare white and green arrow). In advanced stages of bacterial infection (4 or 6&#160;h after infection), co&#8208;localization of mCh&#8208;AS3_67 with Salmonella could not be detected despite the observation that a subpopulation of cytosolic bacteria was strongly positive for endogenous LC3C (Figs&#160;5C and EV6D). In contrast to LC3C, endogenous LC3B accumulated in spots in close proximity to the bacteria (Fig&#160;5C).</text>

      <text>To validate the specificity of the antibody used for staining of endogenous LC3C, we performed pull&#8208;down experiments with purified, recombinant mATG8s and showed that the antibody specifically immunoprecipitated LC3C (Fig&#160;EV6E). We further characterized binding characteristics of AS_67 to mATG8s by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) demonstrating that binding of the engineered sensor is specific for LC3C (Fig&#160;EV6F&#8211;H). We hypothesize that upon prolonged Salmonella infection, LC3C is shielded by endogenous autophagic protein complexes that outcompete the sensor for binding to LC3C. This is supported by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) data, which show the fingerprint region of LC3C upon AS_67 binding. As expected, the residues of the LIR binding region of LC3C are also involved in the interaction with AS_67 (Fig&#160;EV6G). Consequently, endogenous proteins that have a higher affinity can outcompete the transient interaction of the sensor mCh&#8208;AS3_67 with LC3C.</text>

      <text>To further improve the mCh&#8208;AS3_67 sensor, we considered the following two options: (i) A membrane&#8208;tethering domain fused to AS3_67 could serve as an additional anchor to promote binding of sensors to autophagosomal membranes, in addition to lipidated LC3C; and (ii) fusion to an oligomerization domain could also contribute to local enrichment of the AS3_67 sensor (Fig&#160;3G). To this end, we fused mCh&#8208;AS3_67 to the mutated FYVE domain of EEA1 as a membrane&#8208;tethering domain (Hayakawa et&#160;al, 2004) or used the PB1 domain of p62 as an oligomerization domain (Wurzer et&#160;al, 2015). Constructs carrying the additional domain either upstream or downstream of mCherry were generated and tested for their efficiency in detecting LC3C&#8208;positive structures under autophagy&#8208;induced conditions (KU&#160;+&#160;Baf treatment, as in Fig&#160;3D). The presence of the PB1 domain between mCherry and AS3_67 or N&#8208;terminal addition of the FYVE domain significantly increased the sensitivity of the LC3C&#8208;specific sensor AS3_67 (Fig&#160;5D). The control constructs expressing only oligomerization or membrane&#8208;tethering domains, mCh&#8208;PB1 and FYVE&#8208;mCh, respectively, showed largely cytosolic localization, similar as when expressing mCherry alone (Fig&#160;EV6A). Only a minor fraction of cells contained aggregated mCh&#8208;PB1 or clusters, which were distinct from LC3C spots (Fig&#160;EV6B). Furthermore, combining the PB1 domain with the AS3_p62 sensor improved recognition of autophagosomes labeled with endogenous LC3B (Fig&#160;5E).</text>

      <text>Next, FYVE&#8208;mCh&#8208;AS3_67 and mCh&#8208;PB1&#8208;AS3_67 were tested for their ability to monitor LC3C&#8208;positive cytosolic Salmonella (Fig&#160;5F). In this experiment, we detected cytosolic bacteria via its GFP reporter, while the total pool of Salmonella was stained with DAPI. The sensor mCh&#8208;PB1&#8208;AS3_67 was recruited to Salmonella even at later stages of infection. In addition to autophagosomes forming directly around bacteria, the sensor stained vesicles in proximity to bacteria that potentially serve as membrane source or initiation points for new autophagosomes (Fig&#160;5F). Also the FYVE&#8208;mCh&#8208;AS3_67 sensor was recruited to cytosolic Salmonella, but its recruitment was less prominent than with the PB1 construct (Fig&#160;EV6C). These findings indicate the efficacy of the improved LC3C sensors mCh&#8208;PB1&#8208;AS3_67 and FYVE&#8208;mCh&#8208;AS3_67 to monitor LC3C&#8208;dependent xenophagy in cells.</text>

      <text>Recent evidence indicates involvement of LC3C in the clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria (Lazarou et&#160;al, 2015). To further validate this finding, we applied our optimized LC3C sensor (mCh&#8208;PB1&#8208;AS3_67) to monitor mitophagy in&#160;vivo. EGFP&#8208;tagged LC3C or LC3A was co&#8208;expressed with mCh&#8208;PB1&#8208;AS3_67 in U2OS cells. Mitophagy was induced by CCCP treatment and the mitochondria were stained with MitoTracker Deep Red. EGFP&#8208;LC3C coated a subpopulation of depolarized mitochondria, and the same subpopulation of mitochondria was decorated with LC3C&#8208;specific sensor mCh&#8208;PB1&#8208;AS3_67 (Fig&#160;6A). mCh&#8208;PB1&#8208;AS3_67 remained bound to a subpopulation of mitochondria in cells co&#8208;expressing EGFP&#8208;LC3A, indicating that the recruitment of the sensor was driven by endogenous LC3C (Fig&#160;6B). EGFP&#8208;LC3A showed a different localization pattern compared to EGFP&#8208;LC3C and formed small puncta&#8208;like structures in close proximity to the sensor&#8208;coated mitochondria fraction (Fig&#160;6B). Our findings demonstrate that endogenous LC3C is recruited to mitochondria during mitophagy and that this can be monitored by the sensor mCh&#8208;PB1&#8208;AS3_67. Indeed, endogenous LC3C seems to accumulate on mitochondria upon depolarization by CCCP and additional block of lysosomal degradation by bafilomycin A1 (Baf) treatment (Fig&#160;6C). The signal of endogenous LC3C overlaps to a large extent with sensor mCh&#8208;PB1&#8208;AS3_67 and seems to accumulate within lysosomes (Fig&#160;6D), indicating a function of LC3C in delivering dysfunctional mitochondria to the lysosome.</text>

      <text>Phage display was used to isolate peptides that possess bona fide LIR (LC3&#8208;interacting region) properties. Although many of the selected peptides have shown strong specificity for individual mATG8 proteins in&#160;vitro, their implementation as in&#160;vivo sensors to monitor endogenous mATG8 was not trivial, as the initial tests showed that the sensors lacked sufficient binding affinity. Consequently, we further optimized individual mATG8 sensors by peptide multiplication, charge optimization, and introduction of additional anchor domains to assist the binding to mATG8&#8208;positive structures. In a next step, the sensors were subjected to extensive validation, starting from in&#160;vitro characterization, via analysis of their performance in a cellular environment, to an application in functional assays.</text>

      <text>We adapted the phage display for the development of specific mATG8 binding peptides based on previous protocols to derive linear binding motifs with high affinity and high specificity (Skelton et&#160;al, 2003). Due to the avidity effect of displaying a peptide library on major coat protein p8, it is possible to detect subtle differences in biophysical constraints in peptide recognition modules (Sidhu et&#160;al, 2000; Ernst et&#160;al, 2009). Although members of the mATG8 family are structurally conserved, GABARAP, GABARAPL1, GABARAPL2, and LC3C are sufficiently different to allow the selection of specific binders. Surprisingly, the binding sites present on LC3A and LC3B seem to be too similar to give rise to a selective peptide; therefore, we focused our efforts on creating a peptide that is able to differentiate between LC3A/B and the remaining mATG8s. To this end, we used monovalent display on p3 in combination with extensive pre&#8208;adsorption on LC3C and GABARAPs, which resulted in a high&#8208;affinity peptide specifically binding to both LC3A and LC3B.</text>

      <text>The selectivity of peptides for individual mATG8s was initially analyzed by ELISA of peptides displayed on phage particles (Fig&#160;1C). It was followed by in&#160;vitro pull&#8208;down assay of first&#8208;generation sensors, consisting of a fluorophore fused to the respective peptides (Fig&#160;1D and Appendix&#160;Fig S1). To our surprise, the specificity observed in phage ELISA and pull&#8208;down experiment did not overlap, underlining the need for biochemical tests of monovalently expressed peptides. The initial analysis of peptides showed that their specificity for mATG8s in pull&#8208;down assays was preserved in cellulo, yet most sensors of the first generation were poorly performing in cells (Figs&#160;2 and EV1). To overcome this shortcoming, we applied different strategies to improve the sensitivity of our sensors, while attempting to preserve the specificity and prevent unwanted inhibitory effects (Fig&#160;3G). In most cases, the performance of the sensors could be considerably improved by multiplication of the peptide sequence, thus increasing the avidity of the mCherry&#8208;tagged sensor. Unexpectedly, multiplication of the GABARAPL2&#8208;specific peptide AS_30 led to intracellular instability of the sensor mCh&#8208;AS3_30 (Fig&#160;EV3C). We could alleviate this defect by the identification of the minimal binding motif and subsequent truncation of the peptide (Fig&#160;EV3).</text>

      <text>Another approach to optimize binding was inspired by studies on the autophagy receptor optineurin where phosphorylation in close proximity to the LIR motif improves affinity to mATG8s (Wild et&#160;al, 2011; Rogov et&#160;al, 2013). Introduction of negatively charged amino acids close to the CLIR&#8208;like motif of sensor AS_67 improved the interaction with LC3C of the resulting sensor AS_M67 (Fig&#160;2F; Table&#160;EV1). However, introduction of negative charges also abrogated LC3C specificity and resulted in additional binding to LC3B (Fig&#160;3E). Analogous to ubiquitin chains and their respective receptors, phosphorylation close to the LIR motif in many cases seems to not only increase the affinity, but also broaden the selectivity of binding (Wild et&#160;al, 2011; Farre et&#160;al, 2013; Heo et&#160;al, 2015; Richter et&#160;al, 2016).</text>

Surprisingly, the p62&#8208;derived sensor mCh&#8208;AS3_p62 exhibited a preferential binding to LC3A and LC3B, despite the initial pull&#8208;down results suggesting that it is a pan&#8208;specific sensor (Figs&#160;1D and EV3A and B).</text>

      <text>In this context, one also needs to point at an important limitation of using overexpressed mATG8s for selectivity testing in wild&#8208;type cells: there is always a possibility that endogenously expressed target ATG8 participates in the sensor recruitment, thus masking its true binding specificity. Trustworthy analysis of the sensor efficacy with endogenously expressed ATG8s depends on the availability of reliable antibodies or KO cell lines for individual ATG8s. After extensive validation of commercially available antibodies we could only confirm the specificity of antibodies to LC3B and LC3C. Consequently, we could show that LC3B sensors mCh&#8208;AS3_AB2 and mCh&#8208;AS3_p62 are both recruited to autophagosomes coated with endogenous LC3B (Figs&#160;3B and 5E, and data not shown) whereas the LC3C sensor mCh&#8208;PB1&#8208;AS3_67 was recruited to endogenous LC3C (Fig&#160;6D).</text>

      <text>In addition, the LC3C antibody was invaluable to assess the usage of the generated sensors in&#160;vivo. We used LC3C sensor AS3_67 to study the poorly understood role of LC3C in selective autophagy pathways. The function of LC3C in autophagy has been mainly assigned to xenophagy and, recently, to COPII&#8208;dependent ER export as well as to mitophagy (von Muhlinen et&#160;al, 2012; Lazarou et&#160;al, 2015; Stadel et&#160;al, 2015). Here, we show that sensor AS3_67 is recruited to Salmonella escaping from SCVs into the cytosol (Fig&#160;5). This is consistent with the current view that LC3C is responsible for the efficient recruitment of NDP52 to damaged SCVs, thereby facilitating the sequestration of the bacteria into autophagosomes (von Muhlinen et&#160;al, 2012; Verlhac et&#160;al, 2015). However, the mCh&#8208;AS3_67 sensor was unsuccessful in tracking endogenous LC3C at later stages of Salmonella infection. Thus, in order to extend the application range of the LC3C sensor for xenophagy study, we further improved sensor mCh&#8208;AS3_67 by introducing either the oligomerization domain PB1 of p62 or the membrane&#8208;binding domain FYVE as assisting domains (Fig&#160;3G). In particular, the oligomerization domain of p62 increased the sensitivity of the sensor. Additionally to monitor xenophagy events, the sensor mCh&#8208;PB1&#8208;AS3_67 revealed a subpopulation of mitochondria that are coated with LC3C during mitophagy, indicating an LC3C/NDP52&#8208;mediated mechanism similar to xenophagy of Salmonella (Verlhac et&#160;al, 2015).</text>

      <text>The engineered LIR&#8208; or CLIR&#8208;like motifs of the sensors do not seem to influence autophagy and mitophagy flux indicating that endogenous receptors and effectors specific for LC3C outcompete the sensor and still are able to function. While this is positive on the one side, it also means that the sensor will be unable to monitor events where LC3C is low in concentration and/or tightly associated with effector proteins. Nevertheless, our sensors can be used to study early events in autophagy that precede the recruitment of effector proteins or processes with high local concentration of mATG8s. Similarly to studying xenophagy and mitophagy, mATG8 sensors could be used to investigate cellular processes other than autophagy such as mATG8&#8208;dependent intracellular transport pathways including unconventional secretion and exocytosis (Nowag &amp; Munz, 2015; Stadel et&#160;al, 2015), LC3&#8208;associated phagocytosis (Sanjuan et&#160;al, 2007), or the role of LC3&#8208;coats on double membranes required for viral infections (Reggiori et&#160;al, 2010).</text>

      <text>Having established several sensors for individual mATG8 proteins&#8212;p62&#8208;derived sensor mCh&#8208;AS3_p62, LC3A and LC3B sensor mCh&#8208;AS3_AB2, LC3B and LC3C sensor mCh&#8208;AS_M67, LC3C sensor mCh&#8208;AS3_67, GABARAPL1 sensor mCh&#8208;AS3_99, and GABARAPL2 sensor mCh&#8208;AS2_10M30&#8212;a variety of applications are within reach, including live imaging of dynamic autophagy events as well as simultaneous monitoring of individual mATG8s and their distinct behaviors in cells. Preliminary data on live cell imaging of sensor mCh&#8208;PB1&#8208;AS3_67 (red) decorating MitoTracker Deep Red&#8208;labeled mitochondria (green) upon CCCP treatment support this view (Movie EV1). As final selectivity analysis for sensors in ATG8 KO cell lines remains open, sensors cannot be used as definite proof for localization of a specific ATG8, but they can give important indications, followed by a more detailed analysis of the process. For autophagy&#8208;independent functions of mATG8s, one could imagine further optimization approaches by introduction of other anchor domains customized for the process of interest. Overall, ATG8 sensors provide potent tools for revealing different functions of individual LC3 and GABARAP family members in&#160;vivo.</text>

      <text>mATG8 proteins were expressed as GST fusions and purified from Escherichia coli. The phage selections were performed as described (Tonikian et&#160;al, 2007). The concentration of the immobilized target protein was gradually decreased from 2 to 0.25&#160;&#956;M in consecutive selection rounds. The phage pool was pre&#8208;adsorbed on immobilized non&#8208;cognate mATG8 proteins (5&#160;&#956;M in total). After the pre&#8208;adsorption, 5&#160;&#956;M (sum) of non&#8208;cognate mATG8 proteins was added to the phage pool and then transferred onto the selection plate. In the initial rounds of selections, input phage pools were additionally pre&#8208;adsorbed on immobilized GST alone (2&#160;&#956;M in coating solution). All pre&#8208;adsorption steps were carried out at 4&#176;C, while binding to the target isoform was performed at room temperature (RT). During selections, we applied increasing number of plate washes (from eight times with cold buffer in the first round to 12 times RT buffer in the last round) and, in the last selection rounds, we diluted the phage input up to 10,000 times.</text>

Before induction of mitophagy, MitoTracker Deep Red (Life Technologies) was added to the media for 45&#160;min and removed from the media by one washing step. Cells were subsequently incubated in media containing 20&#160;&#956;M CCCP for 3&#160;h. In Fig&#160;6C, a mCherry&#8208;based marker is used to label mitochondria (Gomes et&#160;al, 2011). Salmonella infection was performed as described in Fiskin et&#160;al (2016). For fixation, cells were incubated in 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde in PBS for up to 20&#160;min. For staining of endogenous LC3B and staining with anti&#8208;dsRED antibody to enhance sensor signal in MEFs (Fig&#160;3C), cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X&#8208;100 for 3&#160;min, blocked in 5% BSA for 1&#160;h, and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies for 1&#160;h at RT, respectively, each step followed by intensive washing with PBS.

      <text>For semiautomatic quantification of IF images, the Leica Application Suite X 2D Analysis and 2D Analysis Multi Channel Extension software was used. Precise settings can be downloaded via the provided x.cfg file (see Source Data for Expanded View). In brief, the program identifies vesicles/dot&#8208;like structures in two channels (green vesicles&#160;=&#160;EGFP&#8208;ATG8; red vesicles&#160;= mCherry sensor) individually via the following steps: (i) image processing pre&#8208;filter: find white detail&#8212;top hat, size 9; (ii) threshold adjustment MaxEntropy; and (iii) binary processing pre&#8208;filter: discard detail, size 1. In case of no recruitment of the sensor, the auto&#8208;setting of the threshold for the red channel is non&#8208;functional. In this case, the threshold has to be adjusted manually. Subsequently, the number of ATG8&#8208;decorated vesicles recognized by the respective sensor was counted by the overlay of the two channels (co&#8208;localization of objects). Performance of the sensor was calculated by percentage of green vesicles recognized by the sensor (number of co&#8208;localization events divided by total number of objects recognized in green channel).</text>
