      <text>Influenza A virus (IAV)&#8208;induced severe disease is characterized by infected lung epithelia, robust inflammatory responses and acute lung injury. Since type I interferon (IFN&#945;&#946;) and type III interferon (IFN&#955;) are potent antiviral cytokines with immunomodulatory potential, we assessed their efficacy as IAV treatments. IFN&#955; treatment of IAV&#8208;infected Mx1&#8208;positive mice lowered viral load and protected from disease. IFN&#945; treatment also restricted IAV replication but exacerbated disease. IFN&#945; treatment increased pulmonary proinflammatory cytokine secretion, innate cell recruitment and epithelial cell death, unlike IFN&#955;&#8208;treatment. IFN&#955; lacked the direct stimulatory activity of IFN&#945; on immune cells. In epithelia, both IFNs induced antiviral genes but no inflammatory cytokines. Similarly, human airway epithelia responded to both IFN&#945; and IFN&#955; by induction of antiviral genes but not of cytokines, while hPBMCs responded only to IFN&#945;. The restriction of both IFN&#955; responsiveness and productive IAV replication to pulmonary epithelia allows IFN&#955; to limit IAV spread through antiviral gene induction in relevant cells without overstimulating the immune system and driving immunopathology. We propose IFN&#955; as a non&#8208;inflammatory and hence superior treatment option for human IAV infection.</text>

      <text>Influenza A virus (IAV) causes three to five million cases of severe illness and up to 500,000 deaths annually worldwide (Krammer et&#160;al, 2015). IAV is also capable of causing devastating pandemics, as typified by the 1918 &#8220;Spanish Flu&#8221; outbreak that resulted in an estimated 50 million deaths (Kobasa et&#160;al, 2007). IAV primarily replicates in airway epithelial cells (AECs), and in mild forms of the disease, replication is restricted to the upper respiratory tract (Suzuki et&#160;al, 2000). Severe disease caused by IAV infection is characterized by lower respiratory tract infection, hypercytokinemia, bronchopneumonia and tissue destruction (Peiris et&#160;al, 2004; de Jong et&#160;al, 2006). How type I and III interferons (IFNs) contribute to IAV&#8208;induced pathology remains controversial (Kobasa et&#160;al, 2007; Baskin et&#160;al, 2009; Trinchieri, 2010; Durbin et&#160;al, 2013).</text>

      <text>Immunization with inactivated or live vaccines matching circulating IAV strains is the best prophylactic option for protection from IAV. Yet current vaccines rarely induce broadly neutralizing antibodies and therefore are not able to induce cross&#8208;protection against heterologous IAV strains or subtypes (Krammer et&#160;al, 2015). Current influenza antivirals include ion channel blockers and neuraminidase inhibitors, which act directly on viral proteins (Jefferson et&#160;al, 2006). However, targeting IAV directly drives the emergence of drug&#8208;resistant strains due to the high natural mutation rate of IAV. Indeed, since the early 2000s, global spread of adamantane&#8208;resistant A (H3N2), oseltamivir&#8208;resistant seasonal A (H1N1) viruses and adamantane&#8208;resistant pandemic A (H1N1) viruses has been recorded (Hayden &amp; de Jong, 2011). Worryingly, mutations in the IAV genome which confer drug resistance do not require selective pressure to be shared between IAV strains. In order to protect the population from new IAV strains and avoid development of drug resistance, regimens for activation of multiple antiviral host factors would provide improved treatments. The use of immunostimulatory biologics like IFNs would greatly help manage drug resistance, but can be limited by adverse side effects (Muir et&#160;al, 2014), which may be avoided by treatments acting specifically on epithelial cells, the primary cell target of influenza virus.</text>

      <text>Type I IFNs are well&#8208;established antiviral cytokines comprised of 13 distinct IFN&#945; genes in humans, one IFN&#946; gene and several other family members. All type I IFN subtypes act through a common, ubiquitously expressed, heterodimeric receptor (IFN&#945;&#946;R) to induce the transcription of a diverse set of genes known as IFN&#8208;stimulated genes (ISGs) (Randall &amp; Goodbourn, 2008). In particular, type I IFN induces the expression of IFN&#8208;inducible transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), IFN&#8208;regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and orthomyxovirus resistance gene (Mx) family proteins, all bona fide restriction factors of IAV (Everitt et&#160;al, 2012; Ciancanelli et&#160;al, 2015; Haller et&#160;al, 2015).</text>

      <text>More recently discovered, type III IFNs (IFN&#955;1, 2, 3 and 4) are also induced during viral infection and utilize the same JAK/STAT signalling pathway to activate an identical set of ISGs as type I IFNs (Kotenko et&#160;al, 2003; Sheppard et&#160;al, 2003). IFN&#955;s bind to their own independent receptor complex consisting of IL&#8208;10R2 and IFN&#955;R1. Unlike the ubiquitously expressed IFN&#945;&#946;R, IFN&#955;R1 expression is largely restricted to mucosal surfaces such as the lung and gut epithelial layer (Kotenko et&#160;al, 2003; Pott et&#160;al, 2011). We recently demonstrated that both type I and III IFNs can induce an antiviral state in airway epithelia (Crotta et&#160;al, 2013), the principal target cell type of IAV. However, the effects of type I and III IFNs on immune cells vary markedly, resulting in qualitatively and quantitatively different inflammatory responses (Wack et&#160;al, 2015).</text>

      <text>IAV possesses an exceptional ability to escape host adaptive immunity through antigenic shift and drift, making manufacture of a broadly neutralizing IAV vaccine highly difficult. Development of a treatment that will stimulate protective aspects of the host innate immune response to IAV is therefore highly desirable. In this context, type I IFN has been periodically discussed as a possible treatment for IAV during infection (Finter et&#160;al, 1991; McKinlay, 2001; Wang et&#160;al, 2014). Induction of antiviral genes by IFNs has been extensively demonstrated to restrict IAV replication in&#160;vitro, but a concern is the collateral induction of pathology. Type III IFN has been in clinical trials for hepatitis C and demonstrated less adverse effect compared to type I IFN (Muir et&#160;al, 2014) but was never tested against IAV. We therefore assessed the effects of treatment with exogenous type I and III IFNs during the course of IAV infection in&#160;vivo in congenic B6.A2G&#8208;Mx1 mice (Staeheli et&#160;al, 1985). These mice express functional Mx1, an IFN&#8208;induced protein that is central to IAV resistance in both its human and murine forms (Tumpey et&#160;al, 2007; Haller et&#160;al, 2015) but is lacking in most inbred mouse strains. In this improved influenza infection model, we demonstrate that type III IFN is the treatment of choice, as it avoids the potential inflammatory complications associated with type I IFN.</text>

      <text>IFN&#8208;mediated anti&#8208;IAV protection is achieved through the induction of antiviral ISGs in lung epithelia. To ascertain a comparable dosing of mouse type I and type III IFNs for in&#160;vivo treatments, we assessed ISG induction in AEC cultures. Cultures were treated for 4&#160;h with either IFN&#945; or IFN&#955; at stated concentrations and analysed for induction of traditional antiviral ISGs: Rsad2, Oasl2, Ifi203 and the potent anti&#8208;IAV gene Mx1 (Fig&#160;1A). As expected, airway epithelia responded to both IFN types by ISG induction. We used the dose&#8211;response curves resulting from IFN titrations to determine a conversion factor for equipotency between IFN&#945; and IFN&#955; regarding ISG induction (Fig&#160;EV1). Using this conversion factor, we were able to treat mice expressing functional Mx1 with equivalent doses of IFN&#945; and IFN&#955; throughout our study.</text>

      <text>Intranasal IFN treatment of mice prior to infection with IAV (strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1) (PR8) was performed (Fig&#160;1B). Both IFN&#945; and IFN&#955; treatment ablated PR8&#8208;induced morbidity and mortality. This protection correlated with undetectable viral loads at 4&#160;days post&#8208;infection (dpi) in these groups (Fig&#160;1C), indicating that IFN&#945; and IFN&#955; were equally able to induce an antiviral programme in the lung that blocked PR8 infectivity. Our data confirm previous studies that found that pretreatment of mice with exogenous type I IFNs (Tumpey et&#160;al, 2007; Cilloniz et&#160;al, 2012) or type III IFNs (Mordstein et&#160;al, 2008) inhibited replication of a range of IAV strains.</text>

      <text>Pretreatment with IFNs is not a realistic clinical option to protect the population during a large&#8208;scale pandemic as patients seek medical intervention only after clinical onset. We therefore assessed the effectiveness of IFN&#945; and IFN&#955; at ameliorating disease when administered after IAV infection (Fig&#160;1D). Mice were infected with PR8 and treated after onset of clinical signs intranasally with IFN&#945;, IFN&#955; or vehicle control on days 2, 4 and 5 post&#8208;infection. IFN&#955;&#8208;treated mice exhibited significantly lower mortality compared to vehicle control group. In striking contrast, IFN&#945; treatment exacerbated disease causing higher mortality than in infected, vehicle&#8208;treated mice (Fig&#160;1D). The divergent disease outcome between the IFN treatment groups was not due to different antiviral activity, as treatment&#8208;induced reduction in viral load in the lung was similar (Fig&#160;1E).</text>

      <text>Given that control of viral replication was comparable between IFN&#945; and IFN&#955; treatments, we next sought to understand why IFN&#955; treatment was protective, whereas IFN&#945; treatment was detrimental. Severe IAV&#8208;induced disease in humans is characterized by &#8220;cytokine storm&#8221;, innate cell recruitment and epithelial cell damage (Peiris et&#160;al, 2004; de Jong et&#160;al, 2006). We therefore assessed whether or not IFN&#945; treatment alters the immune response to IAV. We measured inflammatory cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid throughout IAV infection and found that IFN&#945; treatment significantly increased secretion of IL&#8208;6, IP&#8208;10, MCP&#8208;1 and other proinflammatory cytokines from day 4 post&#8208;infection onwards, while the cytokine response in the IFN&#955; treatment group was comparable to infected, vehicle&#8208;treated control mice (Fig&#160;2A). Furthermore, treatment with IFN&#945; but not with IFN&#955; led to recruitment of higher numbers of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and inflammatory monocytes into infected lungs from 4 dpi (Fig&#160;2B). The recruitment into infected lungs of other cell types such as B, NK and T cells is not changed by IFN treatment (Fig&#160;EV2A); however, increased activation markers are found on recruited lymphocytes only upon IFN&#945; treatment (Fig&#160;EV2B). Significantly, IFN&#945; treatment increased airway epithelial cell apoptosis, as assessed by TUNEL staining of lung sections, compared to control&#8208;treated mice, while IFN&#955; lowered the frequency of AEC apoptosis compared to control (Fig&#160;2C and D). Thus, in the context of a functional immune response, further stimulation by IFN&#945; leads to immunopathology which is not offset by IFN&#945;&#8208;enhanced antiviral ISG induction increasing protection. In contrast, IFN&#955; treatment does not augment proinflammatory cytokine secretion during IAV infection and, importantly, results in a significant decrease in IAV&#8208;induced AEC apoptosis.</text>

      <text>To understand why treatments with IFN&#945; or IFN&#955; during IAV infection differed so much in the ability to protect mice from IAV&#8208;induced morbidity and mortality, we assessed the response of specific cell types present in the lung during IAV infection to IFN stimulation. We first evaluated the response to IFN treatment in AEC cultures, as they are the primary infection targets of IAV. While IFN&#945; and IFN&#955; treatment induced ISGs in AEC cultures (Fig&#160;1A), neither IFN&#945; nor IFN&#955; stimulation provoked secretion of inflammatory cytokines by these cells (Fig&#160;3A). In contrast, in&#160;vitro stimulation of bone marrow&#8208;derived macrophages, pDCs and conventional DCs (cDCs) lead to the production of proinflammatory cytokines in response to IFN&#945;, but not IFN&#955; stimulation (Fig&#160;3B). This pattern of response explains findings in corresponding in&#160;vivo experiments, where na&#239;ve mice treated with IFN&#945; had elevated concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines in their BAL fluid at 10 and 18&#160;h post&#8208;treatment, whereas neither vehicle control&#8208; nor IFN&#955;&#8208;treated mice showed significant increase in these cytokines (Fig&#160;3C). Thus, type I IFN, but not type III IFN, promotes production of proinflammatory cytokines by immune cells, while epithelial cells are not induced to produce these cytokines by either IFN type.</text>

      <text>To identify the overlaps and differences in the lung transcriptional response to IFN&#945; and IFN&#955;, we performed microarray analysis on whole lungs treated with IFN&#945;, IFN&#955; or vehicle control (Fig&#160;4). Samples were normalized to the average of the vehicle control group and filtered for a fold change of 1.5, yielding 553 genes differently regulated between treatments, of which 429 genes are upregulated upon treatment. K&#8208;means clustering of upregulated genes revealed six gene clusters, one of which contained genes induced by IFN&#945;, but not by IFN&#955; (IFN&#945;&#8208;specific, Fig&#160;4A and Table EV1). The remaining genes were upregulated by both IFN&#945; and IFN&#955; (Common, Fig&#160;4B and Table EV2). Pathway analysis of the IFN&#945;&#8208;specific genes revealed that the top pathways induced are cellular recruitment processes and the &#8220;Role of hypercytokinemia/hyperchemokinemia in the pathogenesis of influenza&#8221; (Fig&#160;4C), while the pathways common between IFN&#945; and IFN&#955; were strongly related to IFN signalling pathways, as expected (Fig&#160;4D). This global analysis demonstrated that IFN&#945; has proinflammatory effects not shared with IFN&#955;, while both IFN&#945; and IFN&#955; induce canonical antiviral responses in the lung.</text>

      <text>To translate our results into human cells, we generated human primary AEC cultures and found that both IFN&#945; and IFN&#955; treatments induced the upregulation of antiviral ISGs such as Rsad2, OAS1 and Mx1 (Fig&#160;5A), as in mouse AEC cultures. PBMCs from healthy donors upregulated ISGs in response to IFN&#945; at both 4 and 24&#160;h (Fig&#160;5B), yet not in response to an equipotent dose of IFN&#955;. Importantly, analysis of cytokine induction by each IFN treatment at 4 and 24&#160;h revealed that IFN&#945; induced secretion of many proinflammatory cytokines including IL&#8208;6, MCP&#8208;1 and IP&#8208;10, while IFN&#955; treatment did not (Fig&#160;5C). Collectively, these data indicate that IFN&#955; treatment of IAV&#8208;infected humans is unlikely to drive a cytokine storm and may therefore be a viable treatment option.</text>

      <text>An ideal pan&#8208;IAV treatment, designed to be given to a population of immunocompetent individuals, should stimulate induction of antiviral genes in AECs to control IAV spread, without driving immunopathology. IFN&#955; treatment satisfies these criteria, as treatment of IAV&#8208;infected mice significantly increased their survival and decreased IAV&#8208;induced morbidity. However, treatments of IAV&#8208;infected mice with comparable doses of IFN&#945; had the contrary effect, increasing IAV&#8208;induced mortality. This highlights the usefulness of IFN&#955; as a therapeutic against respiratory viruses and underscores the fact that treatment with type I and III IFN can have divergent outcomes, despite inducing a highly similar set of genes in responsive cells (Crotta et&#160;al, 2013; Lauber et&#160;al, 2015).</text>

      <text>Induction of antiviral factors by either IFN&#945; or IFN&#955; prior to IAV infection blocks IAV from establishing an infection, thereby inducing sterile immunity and protecting the host. However, this is not a realistic treatment option for a large population. When mouse treatments were started from symptom onset at day 2 of infection both IFN&#945; and IFN&#955; treatment reduced lung IAV titres compared to infected, vehicle&#8208;treated mice. Furthermore, IAV titres in IFN&#945;&#8208; and IFN&#955;&#8208;treated lungs were analogous, which indicates equivalent effectiveness of IFN&#945; and IFN&#955; at restricting IAV replication in&#160;vivo. IFN therapy administered post&#8208;IAV infection likely circumvents the known IAV&#8208;induced blockade of these antiviral cytokines. IAV NS1 protein antagonizes induction of both IFN&#945;&#946; and IFN&#955; in infected host cells by interfering with upstream pathways such as RIG&#8208;I ubiquitination or IRF&#8208;3 activation (Gack et&#160;al, 2007; Hale et&#160;al, 2008). Exogenous IFN treatment therefore may control IAV spread through the lung by bypassing the block in IFN induction due to IAV NS1 action (Ehrhardt et&#160;al, 2010) and thus potentiating ISG expression in infected and uninfected cells.</text>

      <text>IFN&#955; controls IAV replication and consequently diminishes infection&#8208;induced morbidity. However, why does IFN&#945; treatment translate into increased, not decreased morbidity, despite equivalent control of IAV replication exerted by IFN&#945; as by IFN&#955;? The explanation for the pathogenicity of the IFN&#945; treatment is increased inflammation through activation and recruitment of immune cells. This hypothesis is supported by increased inflammatory cytokines in BAL fluids, augmented pDC and inflammatory monocyte frequency in the lung and elevated apoptosis of airway epithelial cells following IFN&#945; but not IFN&#955; treatment. Furthermore, bone marrow&#8208;derived macrophages, cDCs and pDCs secreted proinflammatory cytokines in&#160;vitro only in response to stimulation with IFN&#945;, yet not IFN&#955;. Importantly, IFN&#945;&#946;&#8208;induced inflammation and AEC apoptosis are immune mechanisms which, when controlled, contribute to limiting the spread of IAV, yet in an immunocompetent system, addition of exogenous IFN&#945; may overactivate these mechanisms resulting in cytokine storm, increased inflammatory cell recruitment, higher frequency of AEC death and ultimately, host mortality. By clustering the response to exogenous IFN treatment into IFN&#945;&#8208;specific genes and genes induced by both IFN&#945; and IFN&#955;, we have determined that the pathogenic component driving the hypercytokinemia is specific to IFN&#945; and not common to IFN&#945; and IFN&#955;. The IFN&#945;&#8208;specific gene signature most likely originates from the IFN&#945;&#8208;mediated activation of immune cells. This is corroborated both by the lack of production of proinflammatory cytokines by cultured mouse AEC (in this study) and by studies showing a virtually identical gene induction profile between IFN&#945; and IFN&#955; in cultured murine and human AEC (Crotta et&#160;al, 2013; Lauber et&#160;al, 2015).</text>

      <text>IAV&#8208;induced mortality in humans does not always correlate with high viral load, yet it is always associated with cytokine storm and tissue damage (Peiris et&#160;al, 2004; de Jong et&#160;al, 2006; Louie et&#160;al, 2009; Agrati et&#160;al, 2010; Arankalle et&#160;al, 2010). This highlights that AEC apoptosis and therefore lung damage in IAV infection can be caused by both host immunity&#8208; and virus&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity, and indicates that safe and successful treatment should combat the virus without further immunostimulation. IFN&#955; therapy fulfils these criteria as it enhances IAV clearance and thus protects from virus&#8208;induced AEC apoptosis, without exacerbating those facets of the immune response that also instigate AEC&#160;death.</text>

      <text>IFN&#945; treatment drives immunopathology when used therapeutically in the context of a replicating infection. In contrast, prophylactic IFN&#945; treatment is protective, as was shown also in previous influenza studies using mice and ferrets (Kugel et&#160;al, 2009); what therefore explains this difference? Treatment of uninfected mice with IFN&#945; led to transient proinflammatory cytokine secretion at 10 and 18&#160;h post&#8208;infection, yet these cytokines were no longer detected at 48&#160;h post&#8208;treatment, and no immunopathology was observed. Moreover, IFN&#945; pretreatment blocked virus infection from the onset leading to sterile immunity, and in this context IFN&#945;&#8208;induced inflammation did not augment disease burden. Thus, IFN&#945; alone, in the absence of a further driver of inflammation such as IAV, is insufficient to bring about immunopathology. This may also explain why in another study, IFN&#945; treatment 1&#160;h after i.p. infection with encephalomyocarditis virus was protective, as this time window may be early enough to abort infection (Tovey &amp; Maury, 1999). In contrast, when added to an ongoing immune response driven by a replicating pathogen such as IAV, IFN&#945; treatment can exacerbate immunopathology. We therefore conclude that IFN&#945;&#946;&#8208;based therapies are not appropriate for IAV treatment.</text>

      <text>Our results are in line with previous studies of severe IAV infection that place endogenous IFN&#945;&#946; upstream of immune&#8208;mediated AEC apoptosis and subsequent host morbidity (Hogner et&#160;al, 2013; Davidson et&#160;al, 2014). However, the pathogenic potential of IFN&#945;&#946; reported in these studies was revealed in mouse strains that do not express a functional Mx1 protein. This is particularly significant in terms of translation into human IAV infection as the human homologue of Mx1, MxA, has also been shown to restrict IAV both in&#160;vitro and in&#160;vivo (Pavlovic et&#160;al, 1992, 1995). The mice used in this study may therefore represent a more appropriate model for human IAV infection. While it has to be confirmed whether influenza&#8208;infected ferrets or indeed humans show similar responses to IFN treatment, this is to our knowledge the first time that IFN&#945;&#946;&#8208;driven immunopathology has been demonstrated to outweigh the protective effect of the IFN&#8208;induced potent anti&#8208;IAV protein Mx1 (Horisberger et&#160;al, 1983; Salomon et&#160;al, 2007).</text>

      <text>Unlike the ubiquitously expressed IFN&#945;&#946;R, IFN&#955;R1 is restricted primarily to mucosal surfaces such as the lung epithelial layer (Sheppard et&#160;al, 2003; Mordstein et&#160;al, 2008; Sommereyns et&#160;al, 2008; Pott et&#160;al, 2011). Infection of IFN&#945;&#946;R/IFN&#955;R double&#8208;deficient mice with a panel of respiratory pathogens including IAV revealed that the lungs of these mice were highly permissive to viral replication. IFN&#945;&#946;R&#8722;/&#8722; IFN&#955;R&#8722;/&#8722; mice had significantly higher pulmonary titres of IAV compared not only to wild&#8208;type mice, but also to mice singly deficient for IFN&#945;&#946;R or IFN&#955;R. Increased virus load in IFN&#945;&#946;R&#8722;/&#8722; IFN&#955;R&#8722;/&#8722; mice correlated with higher disease burden and host mortality (Mordstein et&#160;al, 2008). A further study confirmed that signalling of IFN&#945;&#946;R and IFN&#955;R is entirely redundant in AECs and genetic ablation of both IFN&#945;&#946;R and IFN&#955;R specifically in AECs in&#160;vivo resulted in high IAV loads and host morbidity and mortality, in spite of a wild&#8208;type immune system (Crotta et&#160;al, 2013). While these studies demonstrate that IFN&#945;&#946; and IFN&#955; have redundant roles in the control of IAV replication, this is not the case for all viruses. Pretreatment with IFN&#955; did not alter hepatotropic virus&#8208;induced disease progression, and IFN&#945;&#946;R&#8722;/&#8722; mice were just&#160;as susceptible to these viruses as IFN&#945;&#946;R&#8722;/&#8722; IFN&#955;R&#8722;/&#8722; mice (Mordstein et&#160;al, 2008). Thus, the effectiveness of IFN treatment to ameliorate virally induced disease is intimately linked to virus tissue tropism. We demonstrate here that due to restricted cellular distribution of IFN&#955;R, which overlaps with IAV tissue tropism, IFN&#955; treatment promotes antiviral gene induction in relevant cell types without increasing immune cell stimulation, making IFN&#955; an attractive therapy for clinical IAV&#8208;induced disease. As many respiratory viruses exhibit the same epithelial tissue tropism as IAV, IFN&#955; may be a promising therapeutic for other respiratory viruses such as new emerging corona viruses.</text>

      <text>We replicated our data on human AEC cultures and human PBMCs.

Thus, the in&#160;vitro and in&#160;vivo data presented in this paper suggest that IFN&#955; does not stimulate or modulate mouse or human immune cell function in this disease model; however, there is emerging evidence that in some instances IFN&#955;&#8208;mediated immunomodulation may occur (Jordan et&#160;al, 2007; Ank et&#160;al, 2008; Dai et&#160;al, 2009; Liu et&#160;al, 2011; Egli et&#160;al, 2014a; Blazek et&#160;al, 2015; de Groen et&#160;al, 2015a). Among these IFN&#955; effects are the reduction in neutrophil numbers and IL&#8208;1&#946; production in chronic Th17&#8208;driven disease (Blazek et&#160;al, 2015) and suppression of Th2 cytokines (Dai et&#160;al, 2009; Koltsida et&#160;al, 2011. These effects can also be mediated by IFN&#945; (Moro et&#160;al, 2016, reviewed in Davidson et&#160;al, 2015) and are most likely of limited importance in our infection model with low neutrophil numbers and IL&#8208;1&#946; and Th2 cytokine levels. In addition, we find no significant changes in neutrophil numbers by either IFN treatment in infected mice.</text>

      <text>IFN&#955;&#8208;dependent enhanced production of IL&#8208;12 in human macrophages (but not monocytes or DCs) and of IFN&#947; by human NK cells has also been described (Liu et&#160;al, 2011; de Groen et&#160;al, 2015a), but we find that IFN treatments did not change IFN&#947; and IL&#8208;12 levels in infected lungs. Ank et&#160;al (2008) find that only a restricted set of cells, including pDCs and epithelial cells, can be activated in&#160;vitro by IFN&#955;, while other immune cells are not activated by IFN&#955;. Our findings are in agreement with their results for epithelia and other immune cells tested; however, we find no cytokine production by Flt3&#8208;generated BM&#8208;derived pDCs in&#160;vitro. Since their pDCs are purified ex&#160;vivo, the discrepant findings may be explained by this technical difference. Finally, diverging results have been found for B cells, with some studies proposing that a high IFN&#955; environment suppresses human B&#8208;cell responses, while others show in&#160;vitro that IFN&#955;, like IFN&#945;, can promote human B&#8208;cell activation (Egli et&#160;al, 2014a,b; de Groen et&#160;al, 2015b). We find no changes in B&#8208;cell recruitment to the lung by either IFN treatment, but enhanced B&#8208;cell activation mediated only by IFN&#945;, not IFN&#955;, again underlining the lack of direct immune cell activation by IFN&#955; we observe in our model.</text>

      <text>In an adoptive transfer model of anti&#8208;tumour immunity, it was shown that NK cells require the IFN&#955; receptor IL&#8208;28R for full activity (Souza&#8208;Fonseca&#8208;Guimaraes et&#160;al, 2015). The authors also describe that effects of IFN&#945; and IFN&#955; are additive, suggesting that these IFNs have a similar role in NK cell activation. It is therefore unlikely that NK cell actions explain the differential effects of IFN&#945; versus IFN&#955; in our model.</text>

      <text>Further clinical research will be required to compare the proinflammatory potential of type I and type III IFNs in human IAV. Studies in HCV patients indicated a higher incidence of liver&#8208;related adverse events during IFN&#955; versus IFN&#945; treatment, but lower haematological abnormalities such as neutropenia or thrombocytopenia and fewer influenza&#8208;like symptoms such as pyrexia, chills or pain in patients treated with IFN&#955; compared to IFN&#945;, in line with lower direct immunomodulatory effect of IFN&#955; (Muir et&#160;al, 2014). Based on the immunosuppressive effect of IFN&#955; on neutrophils (Blazek et&#160;al, 2015), clinical trials are also planned to test whether IFN&#955; can reduce neutrophil&#8208;mediated pathology in rheumatic disease (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02498808). An additional complexity is that both endogenous and administered IFNs may interact in an additive, synergetic or cross&#8208;inhibitory manner, as demonstrated for the interplay between IFN&#945; and IFN&#947; (Lasfar et&#160;al, 2014) and the intricate relationship between IFN&#945; and IFN&#955; in hepatitis C (Duong et&#160;al, 2014; Egli et&#160;al, 2014b). Since mice, like humans, contain IFN&#955;&#8208;responsive immune cells (Koltsida et&#160;al, 2011; Blazek et&#160;al, 2015), it is encouraging that IFN&#955; treatment does not contribute to a &#8220;cytokine storm&#8221; or host pathology during IAV infection, as we demonstrated here. We suggest therefore that IFN&#955; should be the preferred antiviral compound for treatment of IAV infections.</text>

      <text>As the human population expands, the interface between the animal reservoir of IAV and the human population grows. Increased contact increases the likelihood of a novel IAV strain to cross the species barrier. Coupled with the difficulty of developing an IAV vaccine that will induce broad protection, the time lag between vaccination and host protection, and IAV's exceptional ability to escape host adaptive immunity through antigenic shift and drift, development of a treatment that will stimulate protective aspects of the host immune response to IAV is highly desirable. Furthermore, targeting IAV directly drives the emergence of drug&#8208;resistant strains due to the high natural mutation rate of IAV. As IAV has already evolved mechanisms to antagonize the induction of IFN and given the multiplicity of antiviral effectors that are induced by IFNs, addition of more of these cytokines to an infected system may serve to circumvent IAV&#8208;mediated block of IFNs while also making it difficult for the virus to evolve mutants to escape such a multifaceted antiviral response. In contrast to the ubiquitous effects of IFN&#945;, the match of IFN&#955;R expression and IAV tissue tropism allows IFN&#955;s to target cell types at risk of infection, effectively inducing antiviral genes in these cells and therefore assisting in the control of IAV spread, without the risk of stimulating the immune system to enhance pathology.</text>

Flags were used to filter out probe sets that did not result in a &#8220;present&#8221; or &#8220;marginal&#8221; call in at least 50% of the samples, in any one out of three experimental conditions. The signal intensity of each probe was first normalized on the median intensity of that probe across the control group and then represented as log2 fold change relative to the controls. Subsequent statistical analysis was a one&#8208;way ANOVA to identify genes significantly differentially expressed relative to controls (fold change of &#8805;&#160;1.5; P&#160;&lt;&#160;0.01, Benjamini&#8211;Hochberg&#160;multiple test correction) which were further analysed by K&#8208;means clustering. Microarray data have been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus database under accession code GSE70628.</text>

      <text>Data are shown as the means&#160;&#177;&#160;SEM. Sample sizes were designed to give statistical power, while minimizing animal use. For in&#160;vivo experiments, treatment groups of n&#160;=&#160;6 were standard, and results from several experiments were pooled to reach statistical significance. In in&#160;vivo time course experiments, biological triplicates were chosen as minimum. As a pre&#8208;established criterion, animals with no weight loss (weight at all times &gt;&#160;98% starting weight) during influenza infection were excluded as not infected. Mice from the same litter and co&#8208;housed were allocated to different treatment groups prior to start of experiment, to avoid subjective bias of allocating mice into treatment groups after symptom onset. Data sets were analysed by two&#8208;way ANOVA with Bonferroni post&#8208;tests (weight, cytokine concentration and cellular recruitment time courses), log&#8208;rank (Mantel&#8211;Cox) test (survival) and Student's t&#8208;tests (cytokine or gene induction from cells) or two&#8208;way ANOVA (human samples). GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used for data analysis and preparation of all graphs. P&#8208;values &lt;&#160;0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.</text>

      <text>Influenza is a disease caused by the infection of lung tissue with influenza virus. Lung damage occurring during severe influenza can be inflicted either by the virus itself or by the antiviral immune response. Interferons are a family of soluble molecules called cytokines which are able to induce an antiviral programme in cells and thereby protect these cells from infection. Therefore, interferons are frequently considered as universal anti&#8208;influenza treatment. Interferons can also stimulate immune cells, which can be beneficial or damaging in influenza infection. Different types of interferons have different effects on immune cells and thereby contribute differently to enhancing the immune response during influenza infection.</text>

      <text>Here, we showed that interferon alpha (IFN&#945;) and lambda (IFN&#955;) were both efficient at inducing the antiviral programme in airway epithelia, but only IFN&#945; activated immune cells. When IFN&#945; or IFN&#955; was used to treat influenza&#8208;infected animals, both were able to reduce virus load, but IFN&#945; also increased the ongoing immune response leading to inflammation and lung damage. Therefore, IFN&#955; treatment protected because it helped control the virus without increasing lung inflammation, while IFN&#945; aggravated disease because it enhanced the immune&#8208;mediated lung damage.</text>
