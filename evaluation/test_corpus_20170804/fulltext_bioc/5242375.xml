      <text>Rupture of endosomes and lysosomes is a major cellular stress condition leading to cell death and degeneration. Here, we identified an essential role for the ubiquitin&#8208;directed AAA&#8208;ATPase, p97, in the clearance of damaged lysosomes by autophagy. Upon damage, p97 translocates to lysosomes and there cooperates with a distinct set of cofactors including UBXD1, PLAA, and the deubiquitinating enzyme YOD1, which we term ELDR components for Endo&#8208;Lysosomal Damage Response. Together, they act downstream of K63&#8208;linked ubiquitination and p62 recruitment, and selectively remove K48&#8208;linked ubiquitin conjugates from a subpopulation of damaged lysosomes to promote autophagosome formation. Lysosomal clearance is also compromised in MEFs harboring a p97 mutation that causes inclusion body myopathy and neurodegeneration, and damaged lysosomes accumulate in affected patient tissue carrying the mutation. Moreover, we show that p97 helps clear late endosomes/lysosomes ruptured by endocytosed tau fibrils. Thus, our data reveal an important mechanism of how p97 maintains lysosomal homeostasis, and implicate the pathway as a modulator of degenerative diseases.</text>

      <text>The endolysosomal pathway is particularly vulnerable to membrane rupture and lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). LMP is a detrimental consequence of host cell invasion from the endosome to cytosol by virions and bacteria. Moreover, incorporated chemical compounds and mineral crystals can rupture the organelles causing medical conditions such as kidney damage or alveolar inflammation (Salminen et&#160;al, 2012). In addition, endogenous factors, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) or neurotoxic protein aggregates, can induce lysosomal damage. This imposes a severe stress condition that affects cellular homeostasis, and releases cathepsins that in turn can trigger cell death with relevance for neurodegeneration (Boya &amp; Kroemer, 2008; Nixon, 2013; Repnik et&#160;al, 2013).</text>

      <text>Damaged lysosomes were recently shown to be cleared by selective macroautophagy (called autophagy from here on), which mediates the engulfment of the injured organelles within isolation membranes and ultimately the fusion of the resulting autophagosomes with intact lysosomes for degradation (Dupont et&#160;al, 2009; Hung et&#160;al, 2013; Maejima et&#160;al, 2013). Autophagy of lysosomes (also called lysophagy) involves the established autophagic enzyme machinery that mediates the conversion of the ubiquitin&#8208;like protein LC3 into its lipidated form to decorate the autophagosomal membrane (Mizushima &amp; Levine, 2010; Suzuki &amp; Ohsumi, 2010; Maejima et&#160;al, 2013; Klionsky &amp; Schulman, 2014). The association of autophagosomal membranes with the damaged organelle is thought to be largely mediated by extensive ubiquitination of multiple components of the damaged organelle, which recruits the autophagy machinery and LC3&#8208;adapter proteins such as p62/SQSTM1 (Fujita et&#160;al, 2013; Shaid et&#160;al, 2013; Rogov et&#160;al, 2014). Different types of ubiquitin chains have been detected on damaged lysosomes including those with lysine 63 (K63) and lysine 48 (K48) linkages (Fujita et&#160;al, 2013). However, the significance of individual chain types for LC3 recruitment and how they are regulated has remained largely elusive (Fujita et&#160;al, 2013; Shaid et&#160;al, 2013).</text>

      <text>Various reports from different organisms have linked the hexameric, ubiquitin&#8208;directed AAA+&#8208;type ATPase p97 (also called VCP or Cdc48) and individual p97 cofactor proteins to the endolysosomal system or autophagy (Ren et&#160;al, 2008; Krick et&#160;al, 2010; Ossareh&#8208;Nazari et&#160;al, 2010; Tanaka et&#160;al, 2010; Ramanathan &amp; Ye, 2011; Ritz et&#160;al, 2011; Buchan et&#160;al, 2013; Johnson et&#160;al, 2015). Of note, defective autophagy and compromised lysosome integrity is a prominent cytopathic feature in tissues affected by a VCP/p97&#8208;associated multisystem proteinopathy (MSP) that includes a myopathy and the neurodegenerative components frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Ju et&#160;al, 2009; Tresse et&#160;al, 2010; Meyer &amp; Weihl, 2014; Johnson et&#160;al, 2015). Commonly, p97 is considered a protein &#8220;segregase&#8221; that targets ubiquitinated proteins and often facilitates their degradation in the proteasome. To do so, it cooperates with different sets of ubiquitin adapters and additional cofactors. The best&#8208;studied complex is with the heterodimeric Ufd1&#8208;Npl4 ubiquitin adapter that extracts ubiquitinated proteins from cellular structures in a large variety of processes including ER&#8208;associated degradation (Stolz et&#160;al, 2011; Meyer et&#160;al, 2012; Franz et&#160;al, 2014). However, the apparent role of p97 in autophagy and lysosomal homeostasis, and the identity of the relevant p97&#8208;cofactors that explain its molecular mechanism have remained enigmatic.</text>

      <text>In this study, we show that p97 translocates to lysosomes and is essential for cell survival after lysosomal damage. We identified three cofactors including a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that interact and cooperate with p97 on the damaged lysosomes. Intriguingly, p97 and its cofactors act downstream of K63 ubiquitination and p62 recruitment. Rather, they specifically remove K48&#8208;linked ubiquitin conjugates to promote autophagosome formation and efficient clearance of the damaged organelles. We further show that disease&#8208;associated mutation of p97 attenuates lysosomal clearance and that damaged lysosomes accumulate in pathological tissue. Moreover, autophagy and the p97 endolysosomal damage complex respond to late endosomes/lysosomes that are damaged by endocytosed tau fibrils, thus implicating the pathway in neurodegenerative disease.</text>

      <text>To explore whether p97 is involved in the endolysosomal damage response, we used the lysosomotropic reagent L&#8208;leucyl&#8208;L&#8208;leucine methyl ester (LLOMe) in cultured HeLa cells. As previously reported (Maejima et&#160;al, 2013), LLOMe specifically and acutely damaged late endosomal and lysosomal compartments as visualized by the translocation of cytosolic galectin&#8208;3 (Gal3) (Fig&#160;1A). Acute recruitment of p62 and LC3 indicated initiation of autophagy of the damaged lysosomes (Figs&#160;1A and EV1A), as expected (Maejima et&#160;al, 2013). The damage also triggered a burst of ubiquitination as detected by the pan&#8208;ubiquitin antibody FK2 on the LAMP1&#8208;positive membranes (Fig&#160;1B). Concomitantly, p97 was recruited to lysosomes in the vast majority of cells. This was true for overexpressed GFP&#8208;p97 (Fig&#160;1B) and confirmed for endogenous p97 (Figs&#160;1C and EV1B).</text>

      <text>To evaluate the functional significance of p97 recruitment, we monitored the autophagic clearance of Gal3&#8208;labeled damaged lysosomes over time after LLOMe washout (Fig&#160;1D). In control cells, the mean number of Gal3&#8208;positive lysosomes per cell reached a maximum during the treatment and began to diminish 2&#160;h after washout until they fully disappeared during the course of 12&#160;h in agreement with previous reports (Maejima et&#160;al, 2013). In cells depleted of p97 by siRNA, clearance of Gal3 vesicles was dramatically inhibited and Gal3 vesicles persisted for at least 12&#160;h as shown by the mean number per cell (Fig&#160;1D), and also the percentage of cells with persisting Gal3 (Fig&#160;EV1C).</text>

      <text>Consistent with a role of p97 and autophagy in lysosomal clearance, treatment with the allosteric p97 ATPase inhibitor NMS&#8208;873 (Magnaghi et&#160;al, 2013), or autophagic inhibition with ammonium chloride in the chase media affected Gal3 clearance (Fig&#160;1E). In contrast, proteasome inhibition with bortezomib had no effect on Gal3 clearance (Fig&#160;1E), although accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in whole&#8208;cell extracts was detected (Fig&#160;EV1D). In control&#8208;depleted cells, LLOMe treatment alone even up to 500&#160;&#956;M had only little effect on cell survival (Fig&#160;1F). However, p97 depletion resulted in quantitative cell death when combined with LLOMe treatment in a dose&#8208;dependent manner (Fig&#160;1F), showing that p97 is essential for restoration of cellular homeostasis after lysosomal damage. In contrast, depletion of SEL1L, which like p97 is involved in the ER stress response, had no effect on cell survival.</text>

      <text>To examine whether p97 and autophagy respond also to lysosomal damage caused by agents other than LLOMe, we used neurotoxic aggregates, which can damage lysosomes when endocytosed (Freeman et&#160;al, 2013). Tau fibrils are released from cells in a number of neurodegenerative pathologies. We generated fluorescently labeled fragments of tau fibrils in&#160;vitro that are capable of inducing aggregation of endogenous tau in cells when added to the culture media (Poepsel et&#160;al, 2015). Consistent with a previous report (Wu et&#160;al, 2013), tau fibrils were endocytosed and transported to LAMP1&#8208;positive compartments (Fig&#160;EV1E). Crucially, the endocytosed tau fibrils induced translocation of Gal3 and colocalized with LC3 indicating lysosome rupture and initiation of autophagy (Figs&#160;1G and EV1E). Consistent with a role for p97 in lysophagy, cellular depletion of p97 led to an accumulation of Gal3 vesicles during the incubation with tau fibrils (Fig&#160;1H).</text>

      <text>Mutations in p97 cause a degenerative disorder marked by the accumulation of aberrant autophagosomes and endolysosomes in affected tissues. Consistent with this, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) generated from p97R155H/wt knockin mice showed impaired clearance of lysosomes after LLOMe treatment as compared with p97wt/wt control MEFs (Fig&#160;2A). This was also true for other disease&#8208;associated mutations including L198W and A232E when overexpressed in stable inducible cell lines (Figs&#160;2B and EV2A). Western blot analysis of LC3 lipidation in these cells revealed an increase and persistence of LC3&#8208;II after LLOMe washout suggesting impairment in autophagy flux and clearance during lysophagy (Figs&#160;2C and EV2B for quantification). Moreover, the affected skeletal muscle tissue from patients carrying p97 disease mutations accumulated Gal3&#8208;positive vesicles in the sarcoplasm, whereas this was not observed in control muscle (Fig&#160;2D). The Gal3 signal often colocalized with caveolin&#8208;3 (Cav3) (Fig&#160;2D), which we showed earlier accumulates at the limiting membrane of late endosomes and lysosomes as a consequence of the disease mutation (Ritz et&#160;al, 2011). Moreover, Gal3 localized with LAMP2 at sites of lysosomal membrane accumulation typical for the disease (Fig&#160;EV2C), indicating that p97 disease mutations interfere with the ability to efficiently clear damaged late endosomes and lysosomes from affected tissues.</text>

      <text>To explore the molecular basis for p97 activity in lysophagy, we aimed to identify the relevant cofactors that cooperate with p97 in the process. We speculated that the lysosomal damage response involves the p97 cofactors UBXD1 and PLAA, because they had previously been linked to the endolysosomal system or autophagy in different systems and are affected by p97 disease mutations (Ren et&#160;al, 2008; Ossareh&#8208;Nazari et&#160;al, 2010; Ritz et&#160;al, 2011; Wu et&#160;al, 2016). Moreover, we considered the DUB, YOD1, whose homologue OTU1 physically and genetically interacts with p97 and PLAA/Ufd3 in yeast (Rumpf &amp; Jentsch, 2006). Of note, siRNA&#8208;mediated depletion of UBXD1, PLAA, and YOD1 led to significant persistence of Gal3 vesicles compared to negative control depletions 12&#160;h after LLOMe treatment (Fig&#160;3A and B). Depletion efficiency was verified (Fig&#160;EV3A). As expected, control depletion of p97 or the general autophagy factors ATG5, ATG7, and p62 also affected Gal3 clearance. In contrast, depletion of the Ufd1 cofactor, which cooperates with p97 in facilitating proteasome&#8208;mediated degradation of ubiquitinated substrates at the ER, on the outer mitochondrial membrane and on chromatin (Stolz et&#160;al, 2011), with an established siRNA, had no effect on Gal3 clearance.</text>

      <text>To evaluate whether the involvement of cofactors in lysophagy is direct, we monitored recruitment of the candidates to damaged lysosomes. Indeed, UBXD1 and YOD1&#8212;like p97&#8212;readily translocated to lysosomes upon LLOMe treatment in the majority of cells, and also PLAA was recruited in more than 40% of cells, whereas the proteins distributed throughout the cytoplasm and were not localized to lysosomes in untreated cells (Figs&#160;3C and EV3B for quantification). To understand at what level autophagic clearance of Gal3&#8208;positive lysosomes was inhibited, we examined levels of lipidated LC3 (LC3&#8208;II). Depletion of p97, UBXD1, YOD1, or PLAA resulted in accumulation of LC3&#8208;II (Fig&#160;EV3C), which was not increased by bafilomycin A1 treatment compared to control&#8208;depleted cells, suggesting impairment of autophagosome clearance. Consistently, LC3&#8208;II levels persisted in UBXD1&#8208;, PLAA&#8208;, YOD1&#8208;, and p97&#8208;depleted cells 10&#160;h after LLOMe washout, whereas they were cleared in control&#8208;depleted cells (Fig&#160;EV3D). Again, bafilomycin A1 treatment did not further increase LC3&#8208;II levels compared to control cells after LLOMe washout (Fig&#160;EV3D).</text>

      <text>These data indicate a direct involvement of the UBXD1, PLAA, and YOD1 cofactors in the clearance of damaged lysosomes. Intriguingly, the alternative cofactor p47, or the p97&#8208;p47&#8208;associated DUB VCPIP1, also delayed Gal3 clearance (Fig&#160;3A and B). However, in contrast to YOD1, UBXD1, or PLAA, neither p47 nor VCPIP1 localized to damaged lysosomes independently on whether tagged on the N&#8208; or C&#8208;terminus (Figs&#160;3C and EV3B, and data not shown). Moreover, p47 depletion even led to a decrease rather than increase of LC3&#8208;II accumulation (Fig&#160;EV3C) indicating an independent role upstream during LC3 activation consistent with previous results (Zhang et&#160;al, 2015).</text>

      <text>YOD1, UBXD1, and PLAA can all bind p97 individually through dedicated interaction domains (Stolz et&#160;al, 2011; see Appendix&#160;Fig S1A for domain structures). We next asked whether they can bind p97 at the same time and therefore first analyzed proteins co&#8208;immunoprecipitating with UBXD1. Because p97&#8208;cofactor complexes can dissociate quickly after cell lysis (Xue et&#160;al, 2016), we used stable cells expressing the ATPase&#8208;deficient trapping mutant p97&#8208;E578Q (p97&#8208;EQ) at near endogenous levels in addition to p97&#8208;wt cells. Indeed, UBXD1 co&#8208;precipitated p97 and also co&#8208;isolated PLAA in the p97&#8208;EQ background (Fig&#160;3D). This was confirmed for overexpressed UBXD1&#8208;GFP and the reciprocal GFP&#8208;PLAA pulldowns (Fig&#160;EV3E and F), suggesting that a UBXD1&#8208;p97&#8208;PLAA complex can form at least transiently in an ATPase&#8208;dependent manner. YOD1 also only weakly interacted with p97 in co&#8208;immunoprecipitations. However, binding was largely increased in the case of the catalytic mutant C160S (YOD1&#8208;CS) (Fig&#160;3E), which stabilizes associated ubiquitin conjugates (Fig&#160;EV3G). When expressed in the p97&#8208;EQ background, YOD1&#8208;CS robustly co&#8208;isolated p97, UBXD1, and PLAA. The YOD1&#8208;CS&#8208;stabilized complex could also be isolated with endogenous UBXD1 in the absence of p97&#8208;EQ expression, but this required chemical cross&#8208;linking (Fig&#160;3F). The UBXD1 pulldowns also confirmed that the complex did not contain the alternative cofactors Ufd1 or p47 (Figs&#160;3F and EV3E). Thus, UBXD1, PLAA, and YOD1 not only colocalize and cooperate with p97 on damaged lysosomes but also interact at least transiently in a substrate&#8208;dependent manner. For simplicity and to distinguish their activity from other p97&#8208;mediated processes, we would therefore like to term them the Endo&#8208;Lysosomal&#160;Damage Response (ELDR) components.</text>

      <text>The involvement of YOD1 in lysophagy is intriguing, because it is a DUB with specificity for K48&#8208;linked as well as K11&#8208;linked and atypical ubiquitin chains, but has very low activity toward K63&#8208;linked chains (Ernst et&#160;al, 2009; Mevissen et&#160;al, 2013). We therefore assessed the ubiquitination pattern on damaged lysosomes by staining with available linkage&#8208;specific antibodies. As expected, we detected a strong signal for K63&#8208;linked ubiquitin chains on the majority of LAMP1&#8208;positive compartments after LLOMe treatment that were also positive for Gal3 and p62 (Fig&#160;4A), consistent with a role of K63 chains in p62 recruitment to damaged lysosomes for autophagy. K11 staining did not result in any specific signal on lysosomes (data not shown). In contrast, we detected a robust signal for K48 chains (Fig&#160;4A). Of note, K48&#8208;linked ubiquitin conjugates were present on a smaller fraction of damaged lysosomes (Fig&#160;4A). Because co&#8208;staining of K48 and K63 chains with antibodies was technically not possible, we expressed the GFP&#8208;TAB2&#8208;NZF sensor to detect K63 chains (van Wijk et&#160;al, 2012). K48&#8208;specific antibodies confirmed that individual lysosomes were decorated with K63 and K48 chains at the same time (Fig&#160;4B), suggesting that K48 conjugation occurred on a subpopulation of K63&#8208;labeled lysosomes.</text>

      <text>To investigate whether the ELDR components target these K48&#8208;linked conjugates, we first tested GFP&#8208;p97&#8208;EQ, because it traps substrate proteins. Indeed, GFP&#8208;p97&#8208;EQ localized to the majority of K48&#8208;positive lysosomes (Fig&#160;4C and D). The fact that it localized only to a fraction of all K63&#8208;positive lysosomes, but the vast majority of p97&#8208;positive lysosomes were labeled with both K48 and K63 chains (Fig&#160;4C and E), concurs with the notion that p97 selectively localized with K48 conjugates on K63&#8208;positive lysosomes. Furthermore, p97&#8208;positive lysosomes were negative for LysoTracker and cathepsin activity, and colocalized with Gal3 and LAMP1 (Fig&#160;EV4A&#8211;C), showing that these lysosomes were damaged and lost acidification. Colocalization with K48 chains was confirmed for endogenous p97 (Fig&#160;EV4D), as well as for UBXD1, PLAA, and the YOD1&#8208;CS variant (Figs&#160;4F and EV4F), suggesting that all ELDR components targeted K48&#8208;linked conjugates. Consistently, the lysosomes that recruited ELDR components were also positive for K63 chains (Figs&#160;4C and EV4E and F, and EV5C). Thus, a subset of ruptured lysosomes is decorated with K48&#8208;linked ubiquitin chains in addition to K63&#8208;linked ubiquitin and the ELDR components are recruited to these particular lysosomes, as summarized in Fig&#160;4G.</text>

      <text>We followed the dynamics of ubiquitin chains by determining the fraction of K63&#8208; and K48&#8208;decorated lysosomes after lysosomal damage over time (Fig&#160;5A). In control cells, K63 chains emerged early on lysosomes and peaked already after 1&#160;h LLOMe treatment (corresponding to 0&#160;h after washout) with more than 60% of lysosomes labeled at the given LLOMe concentration. In contrast, K48&#8208;linked conjugates appeared later peaking at around 2&#8211;4&#160;h after LLOMe washout with about 25% lysosomes affected indicating that K63 and K48 ubiquitination represent temporally separated events. Both chain types disappeared within 12&#160;h. Consistent with their colocalization, p97 recruitment coincided with the K48 subpopulation peak (2&#160;h after washout), whereas translocation of p62 and initial recruitment of LC3 was already observed earlier (Fig&#160;EV5A). Importantly, depletion of either YOD1 or p97 had a marked effect specifically on K48 chains, leading to an increased number of K48&#8208;positive lysosomes and persistence over time (Fig&#160;5B). In contrast, the level of K63 chains and their initial rate of turnover during the first hours were not affected, although a fraction of K63&#8208;labeled lysosomes persisted along with K48 conjugates.</text>

      <text>Also depletion of PLAA or UBXD1 led to persistence of K48&#8208;positive lysosomes (Fig&#160;EV5B), suggesting that all four ELDR components cooperate in turning over K48 conjugates. Moreover, overexpression of the p97&#8208;EQ mutant impaired clearance of K48&#8208;labeled lysosomes, and p97&#8208;EQ strongly colocalized with these lysosomes even 12&#160;h after washout (Fig&#160;5C and D). Overexpression of the YOD1&#8208;CS mutant had an even stronger effect and resulted in accumulation of K48&#8208;linked ubiquitin conjugates already at 2&#160;h after washout (Figs&#160;5E and F, and EV5C), demonstrating that both the ATPase activity of p97 and the deubiquitinating activity of YOD1 are essential for removing K48&#8208;linked ubiquitin conjugates from damaged lysosomes. In agreement, YOD1&#8208;wt localization to lysosomes correlated with decreased K48 signal on these membranes at 2 and 12&#160;h after washout (Figs&#160;5F and EV5C), suggesting that YOD1 is the major DUB in this process. As a consequence of stabilizing the K48 chains, localization of YOD1&#8208;CS to lysosomes was strongly increased compared to wild&#8208;type. Importantly, overexpression of YOD1&#8208;wt or YOD1&#8208;CS did not affect the levels of K63&#8208;linked ubiquitin conjugates (Fig&#160;EV5C and D).</text>

      <text>YOD1 contains a ubiquitin&#8208;binding site, termed S2, outside of the catalytic center (Mevissen et&#160;al, 2013). However, in ubiquitin&#8208;GST pulldown experiments, YOD1 alone did not detectably interact with ubiquitin (Fig&#160;6A, see Appendix&#160;Fig S1 for protein purity). Also PLAA (full length), which has ubiquitin&#8208;binding sites in its WD40 repeat and PFU domains (Mullally et&#160;al, 2006; Pashkova et&#160;al, 2010), did not bind at the given conditions, and p97 interacted only weakly (Fig&#160;6A). When combined with p97, however, YOD1, but not PLAA, associated with ubiquitin&#8208;GST, indicating that YOD1 and p97 cooperatively interact with ubiquitin. This was dependent on the S2 site, because when using a previously characterized mutant of this site, termed MutS2 (Mevissen et&#160;al, 2013), the interaction of YOD1 and p97 with ubiquitin was largely reduced (Fig&#160;6B). Since PLAA was not detected in the pulldowns, we repeated the experiments with p97&#8208;EQ and also included UBXD1. Consistent with co&#8208;immunoprecipitations from cells, PLAA and UBXD1 integrated into the ubiquitin&#8208;bound complex of YOD1 and p97&#8208;EQ (Fig&#160;6C), showing that YOD1 can act as a ubiquitin sensor for the ELDR components. We next assessed the relevance of the YOD1 S2 ubiquitin&#8208;binding site in cells. Whereas YOD1&#8208;CS was efficiently recruited to damaged lysosomes as described above, the localization of YOD1&#8208;CS&#8208;MutS2 was greatly reduced (Fig&#160;6D). Moreover, overexpression of YOD1&#8208;wt again largely reduced the K48 signal on membranes after LLOMe treatment (Fig&#160;6E). In contrast, YOD1&#8208;MutS2 failed to do so, demonstrating that YOD1 needs to bind ubiquitin via the S2 site to efficiently target and turn over K48&#8208;linked ubiquitin conjugates.</text>

      <text>We next assessed the functional relevance of ELDR&#8208;mediated turnover of K48 conjugates for lysophagy. Because p97 and the ELDR components did not regulate p62 recruitment, we asked whether K48 removal by p97 and YOD1 was linked to LC3 recruitment and autophagosome formation. Of note, GFP&#8208;LC3 efficiently colocalized with K63&#8208;labeled lysosomes in control cells 2&#160;h after damage with high correlation according to the Pearson's coefficient, as expected (Fig&#160;7A). In contrast, LC3 colocalized only to a smaller extent and lower intensity with lysosomes that were decorated with K48 chains (Fig&#160;7A), suggesting that the presence of K48 conjugates on a subpopulation of damaged lysosomes may be incompatible with LC3 recruitment.</text>

      <text>We therefore next analyzed the temporal relationship between YOD1 targeting of K48 chains and LC3 recruitment. We made use of latex beads that are incorporated by cells and, when coated with transfection reagent, can rupture lysosomes and induce an autophagic response (Kobayashi et&#160;al, 2010). We first confirmed in fixed cells that the beads were taken up in LAMP1 compartments and induced Gal3 influx into bead&#8208;containing endolysosomal compartments, which recruited p62 and were K48&#8208;ubiquitinated (Figs&#160;7B and Appendix&#160;Fig S2A and B). In time&#8208;lapse microscopy of live cells expressing mCherry&#8208;YOD1&#8208;wt and GFP&#8208;LC3, we observed targeting of YOD1 to beads followed by slow dissociation (Fig&#160;7C and Movie EV1), indicating that YOD1 bound and then mediated the turnover of K48 conjugates on the bead&#8208;containing lysosomes. Notably, as the YOD1 signal disappeared, it was gradually replaced by LC3 that first associated on one side of the bead and then fully covered it, consistent with removal of K48&#8208;modified substrate proteins by YOD1 being required for LC3 recruitment.</text>

      <text>To test this notion, we first blocked removal of K48&#8208;linked ubiquitin conjugates by overexpression of YOD1&#8208;CS. Overexpressed YOD1&#8208;CS, which we showed above significantly accumulates and colocalizes with K48&#8208;positive vesicles (Figs&#160;4F and EV5C), overlapped with p62&#8208;labeled lysosomes (Fig&#160;7D). However, despite the presence of the LC3&#8208;adapter p62, these lysosomes failed to recruit LC3 (Fig&#160;7D). In a second approach, we inhibited removal of K48 conjugates by depletion of p97 or YOD1 and analyzed the persisting K48&#8208;labeled lysosomes at 12&#160;h after LLOMe&#8208;induced damage. While LC3&#8208;decorated membranes accumulated in the vicinity of K48&#8208;labeled lysosomes, they failed to coalesce even at this late time point (Fig&#160;7E) showing that removal of K48 conjugates by p97 and the ELDR components is required to allow LC3 recruitment and autophagosome formation.</text>

      <text>The data presented here reveal an essential function of p97 in the autophagic clearance of damaged lysosomes. p97 cooperates with a distinct set of cofactors, including UBXD1, PLAA, and the DUB, YOD1, which we term ELDR components (for Endo&#8208;Lysosomal Damage Response) to distinguish this activity from other cellular roles of p97 such as ER&#8208; or chromatin&#8208;associated degradation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the pathway specifically targets and turns over K48&#8208;linked ubiquitin conjugates on damaged lysosomes to promote autophagosome formation. Thus, our findings shed light on the role of p97 in the cellular stress response, autophagy, and disease. In addition, they reveal an important functional distinction of different ubiquitin chain types during autophagic clearance of lysosomes.</text>

      <text>Our data are consistent with K63 chains initiating the autophagic response and mediating p62 recruitment (Tan et&#160;al, 2008; Matsumoto et&#160;al, 2011; van Wijk et&#160;al, 2012), because K63 chains and p62 coincide temporally and spatially early during lysophagy, and are not regulated by the ELDR components. In contrast, the K48 conjugates occur later during the process and only on a subpopulation of K63&#8208;decorated damaged lysosomes. Importantly, our data suggest that, in contrast to K63 chains, K48 conjugates need to be turned over by p97 with help of the ELDR factors to allow formation of autophagosomes. We find that YOD1 specifically cleaves K48 chains, which is in line with previous biochemical studies (Ernst et&#160;al, 2009; Mevissen et&#160;al, 2013), and that overexpression of YOD1&#8208;CS inhibits removal of K48 conjugates on damaged lysosomes and suppresses association of LC3&#8208;positive membranes. Consistently, depletion of any of the ELDR components leads to persistence of K48&#8208;decorated lysosomes that then fail to associate with LC3. This is supported by our finding that YOD1 recruitment and dissociation precedes LC3 association in live cell microscopy.</text>

      <text>Because p97 is generally thought to extract ubiquitinated proteins from cellular structures, an obvious explanation for our observations is that K48&#8208;linked ubiquitination and the ELDR&#8208;mediated removal of one or more factors that interfere with autophagosome formation. A similar model has also been proposed for the role of p97 in mitophagy, where p97&#8208;mediated extraction of factors on the outer membrane, such as mitofusins, is thought to facilitate the clearance of damaged mitochondria or mitophagy (Tanaka et&#160;al, 2010; Chan et&#160;al, 2011). Of note, extraction of mitofusins involves the Ufd1&#8208;Npl4 cofactor (Kim et&#160;al, 2013; Wu et&#160;al, 2016), whereas we identified a distinct set of cofactors in lysophagy including the DUB, YOD1. DUBs such as YOD1 were also shown to contribute to extraction of proteins from the ER membrane during ER&#8208;associated degradation (Ernst et&#160;al, 2009; Liu &amp; Ye, 2012; Stein et&#160;al, 2014). It is therefore likely that YOD1 assists protein extraction from lysosomes. On lysosomes, a whole range of membrane proteins is ubiquitinated upon damage (Fujita et&#160;al, 2013). Removal of the K48 conjugates may therefore facilitate access of LC3&#8208;decorated autophagic membranes to K63&#8208;p62 assemblies on damaged lysosomes. Extraction may be followed by degradation, but this would not be essential for the process, because proteasome inhibitors do not affect lysophagy. Identification of the relevant ubiquitin ligase(s) in lysophagy will help clarify these questions.</text>

      <text>Intriguingly, we find that only a subpopulation of damaged lysosomes is conjugated with K48 chains and that some autophagosomes form early without involvement of K48 chains and independently of the EDLR components. One possible explanation is that K48&#8208;labeled lysosomes represent a particular type of late endosomes or lysosomes and therefore require an additional layer of regulation. Alternatively, the populations may be distinct with respect to the type or degree of damage. Consistent with this notion, diverse bacteria that damage endolysosomal membranes in different ways also induce distinct autophagic responses (Gomes &amp; Dikic, 2014).</text>

      <text>The p97&#8208;governed response involves a distinct set of cofactors that assist p97 during lysophagy. Even though these cofactors bind at the same time to p97 only transiently, it is likely that they tightly cooperate during lysophagy because they all colocalize on damaged lysosomes and are essential for their clearance. Among the three p97 cofactors, UBXD1 appears to be the defining component because it binds p97 in a mutually exclusive manner with other major cofactors such as p47 or Ufd1&#8208;Npl4, and has been associated with endolysosomes and trafficking before (Ritz et&#160;al, 2011; Stolz et&#160;al, 2011; Haines et&#160;al, 2012). YOD1 harbors the essential catalytic DUB activity, but can also function as a ubiquitin sensor by means of its S2 ubiquitin&#8208;binding site. We find that ubiquitin binding by YOD1 appears to stimulate interaction of YOD1 with p97 along with UBXD1 and PLAA and, in turn, p97 activates ubiquitin binding of YOD1. However, targeting of p97 is likely more complex because YOD1 depletion does not impair p97 recruitment to damaged lysosomes (data not shown), whereas it clearly affects p97&#8208;mediated lysophagy. So far, the role of PLAA remains unclear. It appears to be a versatile factor because it also teams up with diverse p97 complexes in other processes at least in yeast (Richly et&#160;al, 2005; Balakirev et&#160;al, 2015; Wu et&#160;al, 2016). It has ubiquitin&#8208;binding domains (Mullally et&#160;al, 2006; Pashkova et&#160;al, 2010) but binds only transiently to p97 depending on the nucleotide state, suggesting that it may coordinate ATP hydrolysis within the process of lysophagy.</text>

      <text>Disease mutations in p97 cause a late onset myodegenerative and neurodegenerative disease termed MSP. MEFs expressing a disease&#8208;associated p97 allele fail to clear damaged lysosomes and MSP patient tissue accumulates damaged lysosomes. This raises the possibility that compromised clearance of damaged lysosomes contributes to the pathogenesis of p97&#8208;associated disease. One intriguing aspect of p97&#8208;associated MSP is the variable penetrance of muscle or CNS pathology even within the same family. This phenotypic heterogeneity has led to speculation that either secondary genetic or environmental factors dictate disease penetrance. The emerging role for p97 in mediating &#8220;damage responses&#8221;&#8212;whether it is DNA damage repair, mitochondrial clearance, or lysosomal homeostasis&#8212;suggests that environmental stressors that occur with age play a key role in p97&#8208;associated diseases (Meyer &amp; Weihl, 2014; Johnson et&#160;al, 2015).</text>

      <text>Our findings also have implications for the relevance of p97 in other diseases where lysosomal membrane permeabilization is an element, such as lysosomal storage diseases and neurodegenerative disorders (Boya &amp; Kroemer, 2008; Nixon, 2013; Repnik et&#160;al, 2013). Intriguingly, tau fibrils, which occur and can be released from cells in a number of pathologies, can damage lysosomes when endocytosed. Tau&#8208;induced damage could further decrease lysosomal fitness and thereby affect the capacity of cells to maintain protein homeostasis. The fact that p97 clears damaged lysosomes and also responds to the tau&#8208;induced lysosomal damage adds an unanticipated aspect to the emerging picture of p97 as a critical modulator of neurodegeneration (Rubinsztein, 2006; Ling et&#160;al, 2013).</text>

Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (15&#160;min, 16,000&#160;&#215;&#160;g, 4&#176;C). GFP&#8208;tagged proteins were affinity&#8208;isolated using anti&#8208;GFP nanobodies. As described previously (Eiteneuer et&#160;al2014), His&#8208;tag nanobodies, purified from BL21(DE3), were coupled to NHS&#8208;activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE) at 2&#160;mg per ml bead slurry according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitations were performed for 2&#160;h at 4&#176;C rotating. Beads were washed 4 times in IP buffer and eluted with 2&#215; SDS sample buffer (95&#176;C for 5&#160;min) for Western blot analysis. For immunoprecipitations upon chemical cross&#8208;linking, the cells were incubated for 10&#160;min at RT in 0.4% PFA and subsequently quenched by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 125&#160;mM. Samples were harvested in IP buffer as above with additional 0.5% Na&#8208;deoxycholate. During the 20&#8208;min lysis incubation on ice, the samples were sonicated twice (15&#160;s). Cleared lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 2&#160;h rotating at 4&#176;C and additionally with Protein G Agarose for 1&#160;h. Beads were washed as above and eluted in 2&#215; SDS sample buffer at 95&#176;C for 10&#160;min to also reverse the chemical cross&#8208;link. Samples were resolved by SDS&#8211;PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham, GE Healthcare). Immunoblot analysis was performed with the indicated antibodies and visualized with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce).
