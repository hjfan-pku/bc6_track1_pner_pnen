      <text>Recent studies have shown that tissue macrophages (M&#934;) arise from embryonic progenitors of the yolk sac (YS) and fetal liver and colonize tissues before birth. Further studies have proposed that developmentally distinct tissue M&#934; can be identified based on the differential expression of F4/80 and CD11b, but whether a characteristic transcriptional profile exists is largely unknown. Here, we&#160;took advantage of an inducible fate&#8208;mapping system that facilitated the identification of CD45+c&#8208;kit&#8722;CX3CR1+F4/80+ (A2) progenitors of the YS as the source of F4/80hi but not CD11bhi M&#934;. Large&#8208;scale transcriptional profiling of M&#934; precursors from the YS stage to adulthood allowed for building computational models for F4/80hi tissue macrophages being direct descendants of A2 progenitors. We further identified a distinct molecular signature of F4/80hi and CD11bhi M&#934; and found that Irf8 was vital for M&#934; maturation. Our data provide new cellular and molecular insights into the origin and developmental pathways of tissue M&#934;.</text>

      <text>Macrophages (M&#934;) play an important role in maintaining tissue integrity and contribute to adaptive and innate immune responses. They are part of the mononuclear phagocyte system and were classically thought to derive from blood monocytes (van Furth &amp; Cohn, 1968). This concept prevailed for nearly half a century (Ginhoux &amp; Jung, 2014). Accumulating evidence, however, including recent studies using sophisticated fate&#8208;mapping approaches, has determined that some tissue M&#934; and their precursors are established embryonically in the yolk sac (YS) and fetal liver before the onset of hematopoiesis in the bone marrow (Ginhoux et&#160;al, 2010; Hoeffel et&#160;al, 2012; Schulz et&#160;al, 2012; Epelman et&#160;al, 2014; Molawi et&#160;al, 2014; Gomez et&#160;al, 2015). However, conflicting reports have recently been published suggesting a different origin for all tissue macrophages except microglia from sources of the definitive hematopoiesis (Sheng et&#160;al, 2015). Thus, the origin of tissue macrophages still awaits its full discovery. We therefore adapted our recently established Cx3cr1CreER fate&#8208;mapping system (Goldmann et&#160;al, 2013; Yona et&#160;al, 2013) to unequivocally determine the temporal and spatial origin of tissue macrophages and to investigate their full transcriptional program during ontogeny from the YS until adulthood.</text>

      <text>Regardless of their origin, tissue M&#934; can maintain themselves in adulthood through self&#8208;renewal and thus independently of blood monocytes (Ajami et&#160;al, 2007; Mildner et&#160;al, 2007; Hashimoto et&#160;al, 2013; Sieweke &amp; Allen, 2013; Yona et&#160;al, 2013). Recent studies have further proposed that the expression levels of the markers F4/80 and CD11b can be used to identify ontogenetically distinct M&#934; populations in various tissues, but failed to determine genetic traits underlying this supposed heterogeneity (Schulz et&#160;al, 2012; Bain et&#160;al, 2014). Previous gene expression profiling of M&#934; populations from several tissues has established that only a small number of mRNA transcripts were associate with all M&#934; but not DCs. However, a core gene signature of all macrophages could be detected (Gautier et&#160;al, 2012). The impact of the tissue environment on M&#934; signatures is now beginning to be unraveled. Epigenetic modifications are one of the conduits through which the organ&#8208;specific environment can influence the established M&#934; identities. The chromatin landscape, among other epigenomic features of a differentiated cell type, reflects both its developmental origin as well as its future potential. Two recent studies compared the tissue M&#934; enhancer repertoire that revealed a tissue&#8208;specific signature with considerable plasticity (Gosselin et&#160;al, 2014; Lavin et&#160;al, 2014).</text>

      <text>However, the regulatory networks, the precise ancestry, and the mechanisms that describe tissue M&#934; development from the YS stage to adulthood are largely unknown. By combining large&#8208;scale transcriptome profiling with fate mapping, immunophenotyping, and confocal imaging, we provide a detailed description of F4/80hi tissue M&#934; development from uncommitted erythromyeloid precursors (EMP; CD45&#8722;c&#8208;kit+) via the M&#934; ancestor populations A1 (CD45+c&#8208;kitloCX3CR1loF4/80lo) and A2 (CD45+c&#8208;kit&#8722;CX3CR1+F4/80+) in the YS to embryonic M&#934; and then fully differentiated M&#934; during adulthood. By using an A2 cell type&#8208;based fate&#8208;mapping system that tracks distinct YS cells, we can furthermore show that in contrast to a recent report (Sheng et&#160;al, 2015) several tissues contain F4/80hi M&#934; that are derived from the YS. Moreover, besides anticipated tissue environment&#8208;related genetic differences, we could identify a core signature in the embryonic and adult F4/80hi and CD11bhi M&#934; population.</text>

      <text>We further identified a transcriptional factor that is essential for both F4/80hi and CD11bhi M&#934; homeostasis in&#160;vivo. There are several transcription factors proven to be important for myeloid cell development including Pu.1, which affects multiple lineages of the hematopoiesis in an early stage including the development of M&#934; (Rosenbauer &amp; Tenen, 2007). Additional transcription factors have been reported to play a role in the differentiation of myeloid cells such as interferon regulatory factor (Irf) 8 as a transcriptional factor of the IRF family (Rosenbauer &amp; Tenen, 2007). IRF&#8208;8 interacts with other transcription factors such as IRF&#8208;1, IRF&#8208;2, IRF&#8208;4 and PU.1 (Tamura &amp; Ozato, 2002). It is known that Irf8 has critical roles in the differentiation of myeloid cells, promoting monocyte over granulocyte differentiation (Tamura &amp; Ozato, 2002). It is also a crucial regulator of many aspects of DC development, differentiation, and function (Tamura et&#160;al, 2008), thus holding an essential role in the establishment of innate immune responses. Although Irf8 is critical for the regulation of several myeloid cell lineages derived from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) including bone marrow&#8208;derived macrophages (Tamura &amp; Ozato, 2002), its role for tissue macrophages emerged from prenatal precursors from the YS or fetal liver, independent from HSCs, is unclear. In fact, recent work proposed a vital role of IRF&#8208;8 only for circulating monocytes but not for tissue macrophages (Hambleton et&#160;al, 2011). In contrast to that report we show that both M&#934; subsets (F4/80hi and CD11bhi) are strongly dependent on the transcription factor Irf8, which in our study influenced M&#934; homeostasis. Our findings substantially increase the understanding of the regulatory processes that characterize tissue M&#934; development in a highly dynamic microenvironment from the YS stage until adulthood.</text>

      <text>In mice, the first hematopoietic progenitors appear in the extra&#8208;embryonic YS where they generate nucleated erythrocytes and M&#934; starting at embryonic day (E) 7.5&#8211;8.0 (Bertrand et&#160;al, 2005; Cumano &amp; Godin, 2007). From E 8.0, multilineage erythromyeloid progenitors (EMPs) emerge in the YS as a second wave that are thought to give rise to tissue M&#934; in the brain (Kierdorf et&#160;al, 2013; Prinz &amp; Priller, 2014) and other tissues as well (Gomez et&#160;al, 2015). After E 9.0, the intra&#8208;embryonic mesoderm commits to the hematopoietic lineage and new waves of hematopoietic progenitors emerge: first in the para&#8208;aortic splanchnopleura (P&#8208;Sp) region and then in the aorta&#8208;gonad&#8208;mesonephros (AGM) region (Cumano &amp; Godin, 2007).</text>

      <text>To follow the fate of myeloid cells during early embryogenesis, we first used Cx3cr1GFP/WT mice, which have a GFP knock&#8208;in on one allele of the Cx3cr1 gene. CX3CR1 is expressed in mature monocytes as well as many tissue M&#934; and their precursors (Yona et&#160;al, 2013). To determine at which time point the YS contains progenitor cells with M&#934; features, we analyzed E 9.0 embryos by thorough confocal microscopy (Fig&#160;1A and B). We detected two distinct populations in the YS at this time point: CD31+c&#8208;kit+ EMPs and CX3CR1+F4/80+ early M&#934; (Bertrand et&#160;al, 2005). Notably, CX3CR1+F4/80+ cells were found in the YS but not in the P&#8208;Sp region indicating a largely YS&#8208;centered localization of early M&#934; progenitors at this developmental stage. By separation of CD45+ cells, we were able to discriminate between two M&#934; precursor subsets, CD45+CX3CR1loF4/80lo A1 cells and CD45+CX3CR1hiF4/80hi A2 progenitors as described before (Bertrand et&#160;al, 2005; Kierdorf et&#160;al, 2013) (Fig&#160;1C).</text>

      <text>From our previous studies, we know that microglia derive from the A2 progenitors of the YS (Kierdorf et&#160;al, 2013). Recently, it was suggested that the progenitor for microglia and other tissue M&#934; are different from each other (Hoeffel et&#160;al, 2015; Sheng et&#160;al, 2015). However, our hypothesis was that F4/80hi M&#934; derive from the A2 progenitors of the YS as well. To perform fate mapping and subsequent gene profiling of tissue M&#934; during ontogeny, we next adapted our recently developed Cx3cr1CreER mouse system (Goldmann et&#160;al, 2013; Yona et&#160;al, 2013) to target A2 progenitors only (Fig&#160;1D). Male Cx3cr1CreER: Rosa26&#8208;fl&#8208;STOP&#8208;fl&#8208;yfp (Cx3cr1CreER:Rosa26&#8208;yfp) mice were crossed to female wild&#8208;type mice, and plug&#8208;positive animals were injected with a single intraperitoneal dose of tamoxifen (TAM) at E 9.0. The application of TAM at E 9.0 induced the recombination of CX3CR1+ progenitor cells and therefore also targeted A2&#8208;derived microglia (Fig&#160;EV1A and B). Importantly, to prove the specificity of our approach, we additionally investigated the recombination efficiency in microglia of E 16.0 embryos after TAM application at E 7.0 and E 8.0 (Fig&#160;EV1B). TAM application at E 8.0 but not at E 7.0 was able to target a small population of A2&#8208;derived microglia (YFP+ cells&#160;=&#160;17.7&#160;&#177;&#160;1.3%) as well as liver (YFP+ cells&#160;=&#160;13.2&#160;&#177;&#160;1.4%) and kidney (YFP+ cells&#160;=&#160;15&#160;&#177;&#160;3.1%) F4/80hi M&#934;. This result shows that the TAM&#8208;induced Cre recombination is restricted to a very limited time window of maximal 1&#160;day. No CX3CR1+ HSCs were present in the E 10.0/E 10.5 AGM or fetal liver proving that we do not target HSCs in our approach (Fig&#160;EV1C and D). Therefore, specific targeting of A2 progenitors by TAM injection at E 9.0 induced efficient YFP labeling of 41.6&#160;&#177;&#160;0.6% brain microglia, 20.8&#160;&#177;&#160;2.5% F4/80hi Kupffer cells, 15.8&#160;&#177;&#160;2.2% F4/80hi kidney M&#934;, and 14.2&#160;&#177;&#160;1.9% MHC II+ CD11b+skin M&#934; at E 16.0, indicating robust labeling efficiency of various A2&#8208;derived M&#934; progeny (Fig&#160;1F). Microglia in 6&#8208;week&#8208;old animals retained the YFP label, demonstrating that A2&#8208;derived cells persists until adulthood, whereas labeling of Kupffer cells, Langerhans cells, and F4/80hi kidney cells was present but dropped after birth (Figs&#160;1E and F, EV1E and EV2). This might be due to a replacement by fetal liver&#8208;derived cells as suggested by others (Hoeffel et&#160;al, 2012; Gomez et&#160;al, 2015). In contrast, CD11bhi tissue M&#934; were not labeled in this approach (Fig&#160;1E and F). Collectively, these data suggest that F4/80hi tissue M&#934; are initially derived from CX3CR1+ A2 cells in the YS, whereas CD11bhi tissue M&#934; develop independently from A2 cells.</text>

      <text>After having established an A2 YS&#8208;dependent labeling system, we isolated EMP from E 8.0 YS, A1 and A2 cells from E 9.0 YS, and embryonic F4/80hi M&#934; from E 14.5 brain, liver, and kidney and performed a whole&#8208;genome expression analysis using the Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.1 ST Array. Subsequent investigation of the 1,000 most variable transcripts by hierarchical clustering (Fig&#160;1G) and generating a co&#8208;regulation network based on all expressed transcripts (Fig&#160;1H) revealed that EMPs represent an early step in M&#934; hierarchy followed by the YS populations A1 and A2, while A2 cells obviously represent a nodal point of tissue M&#934; development (Fig&#160;1G and H). These data suggest that the M&#934; populations analyzed gain their own tissue&#8208;specific signature once they have left the YS and that A2 YS progenitors are ancestors of embryonic F4/80hi tissue M&#934;.</text>

      <text>Once established in the CNS, microglia persist throughout the entire life of the organism without any significant input from circulating blood cells due to their longevity and their capacity for self&#8208;renewal (Ajami et&#160;al, 2007; Mildner et&#160;al, 2007). We therefore sought to use this unique feature of microglia to compare the kinetics of persistence with F4/80hi and CD11bhi cells from the kidney and liver. For this purpose, we induced adult Cx3cr1CreER:R26&#8208;yfp animals with TAM and determined M&#934; labeling at several time points after application (Fig&#160;2A&#8211;C). FACS analysis demonstrated long&#8208;term labeling of microglia and F4/80hi kidney M&#934; with virtually no turnover in microglia and low turnover in F4/80hi kidney M&#934; (exchange rate: approx. 2%/week). In contrast, YFP labeling rapidly dropped in CD11bhi cells in liver and kidney indicating higher turnover rates (approx. 32%/week for both organs). Notably, Kupffer cells dynamically express CX3CR1 during development but lose their expression shortly after birth which is why their turnover cannot be monitored during adulthood (Yona et&#160;al, 2013). To circumvent these limitations, we adapted our Cx3cr1CreER:R26&#8208;yfp system and induced recombination shortly after birth when F4/80hi Kupffer cells still express CX3CR1 (Fig&#160;2C). We successfully targeted at least a subpopulation of the F4/80hi Kupffer cells. Similar to their relatives in the brain, this Kupffer cell population remained a remarkably stable population until 9&#160;months of age. To evaluate a possible contribution of blood cells to the macrophage populations, we evaluated the contribution of both Ly6Chi and Ly6Clo monocytes. We first measured the expression of monocyte&#8208;related CCR2 that was absent on F4/80hi Kupffer cells, only partially present on F4/80hi kidney M&#934; but clearly present on CD11bhi M&#934; (Fig&#160;2D). Furthermore, we provide genetic evidence that Ly6Chi monocytes contributed to the homeostasis of F4/80hi kidney M&#934; as well as CD11bhi M&#934; shown by reduced cell numbers in mice lacking Ccr2 (Fig&#160;2E). In contrast, Ly6Clo monocytes were dispensable for F4/80hi and CD11bhi M&#934; development and homeostasis as mice lacking Nr4a1 presented with normal amounts of M&#934; subsets in liver and kidney (Fig&#160;2E). These data indicate that adult microglia and Kupffer cells are stable populations which do not undergo significant exchange with blood cells within the first 9&#160;months of life. In contrast, adult F4/80hi kidney M&#934; are partially replaced by blood monocytes, whereas adult CD11bhi M&#934; found in the liver and kidney have a fast and continuous exchange with circulating CCR2&#8208;dependent progenitors, most likely Ly6Chi monocytes.</text>

      <text>The results presented above suggested that microglia and F4/80hi M&#934; from liver and kidney are derived from CD45+CX3CR1hiF4/80hi A2 progenitors in the YS, whereas CD11bhi M&#934; seem to originate from later hematopoietic sources, for example, elements from the definitive hematopoiesis (Ginhoux &amp; Jung, 2014). Thus, we examined whether this divergent origin is mirrored by a distinct gene profile. To do so, we performed an unsupervised clustering analysis of genomewide expression arrays from embryonic (Fig&#160;3A) and adult (Fig&#160;3B) F4/80hi M&#934; in comparison with the CD11bhi populations. Hierarchical clustering based on the 1,010 most differentially expressed genes revealed that all F4/80hi M&#934; in the brain, liver, and kidney shared a common signature of expressed genes, which was clearly distinct from the CD11bhi cells. Importantly, F4/80hi versus CD11bhi M&#934; clustering was not only present prior to birth as described recently (Schulz et&#160;al, 2012) but was still detectable in adulthood (Fig&#160;3A and B). Based on the clear cut separation of F4/80hi versus CD11bhi M&#934; by hierarchical cluster analyses, we created two groups, including only the embryonic or adult F4/80hi (microglia, liver and kidney) or CD11bhi (liver and kidney) M&#934; and excluded genes that were significantly differentially expressed within one of the groups (Fig&#160;3C and D). This approach confirmed the hypothesis of robust similarities within M&#934; subgroups rather than within different M&#934; populations in the same organ (Fig 3D). Notably, only adult Langerhans cells were transcriptionally separate from both adult F4/80hi and CD11bhi M&#934; in other tissues emphasizing their distinct ancestry and kinetics compared to other M&#934; as described before (Hoeffel et&#160;al, 2012) (Fig&#160;3B and E). Up&#8208; and down&#8208;regulated genes in F4/80hi versus CD11bhi M&#934; were examined thoroughly (Fig&#160;3F&#8211;I). The hemoglobin Y, beta&#8208;like embryonic chain (Hbb&#8208;y), and hemoglobin X, alpha&#8208;like embryonic chain in Hba complex (Hba&#8208;x), were highly enriched in embryonic F4/80hi M&#934; of all tissues reflecting their common origin with erythrocytes from the EMP. Two E3 ubiquitin&#8208;protein ligases, namely Rnf135 and March8 that mediate ubiquitination of immune molecules such as CD86, MHC class II, and RIG&#8208;I, were more highly expressed in adult F4/80hi M&#934; compared to CD11bhi M&#934;. On the contrary, solute carrier family 7, member 11 (Slc7a11), involved in the protection from oxidative stress, and prostaglandin&#8208;endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2, also known as cyclooxygenase&#8208;2; Cox&#8208;2) involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses were highly up&#8208;regulated in adult CD11bhi M&#934;. Additionally, adult CD11bhi M&#934; were characterized by the enhanced expression of the chemokine receptor Ccr2 and the growth factor Flt3 that is present in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors. Complementary to the above data showing a contribution of Ly6Chi monocytes to F4/80hi kidney M&#934;, Ccr2 was also expressed in a high manner in this M&#934; population. Long&#8208;living adult F4/80hi M&#934;, however, expressed high levels of the transcription factor Maf and the macrophage colony&#8208;stimulating factor (Csf1r). We further visualized additional prominent examples of differentially expressed genes between F4/80hi and CD11bhi M&#934; in different tissues during embryogenesis and adulthood related to macrophage function such as cytokines and other secreted proteins, antigen capturing molecules, proteolytic enzymes, cell surface markers, and transcription factors (Fig&#160;EV3 and Table&#160;EV1). Taken together, our observations suggest that a distinct genetic profile of F4/80hi and CD11bhi M&#934; is present prenatally and in adulthood.</text>

      <text>In addition to CSF&#8208;R1, several transcription factors such as PU.1 (encoded by Sfpi) and Runx1 have been shown to be important for the lineage commitment in myeloid cells (Rosenbauer &amp; Tenen, 2007). It is well established that PU.1 can act alone or in association with other transcription factors such as IRF8 (Rosenbauer &amp; Tenen, 2007). To determine which transcription factors are present during macrophage development, we measured Runx1, Sfpi, and Irf8 levels in sorted EMP, A1 and A2 cells, embryonic microglia, and F4/80hi and CD11bhi M&#934; from kidney and liver (Fig&#160;4A). Irf8 and Sfpi were barely detectable in EMP, whereas Runx1 was strongly expressed. Notably, Irf8, Runx1, and Sfpi mRNA levels were continuously expressed during prenatal macrophage development, suggesting that these transcription factors play an important role for these macrophage populations. Since Irf8 was described to play an essential role in the development of microglia, especially in the maturation of the A1 to A2 progenitor populations in the YS (Kierdorf et&#160;al, 2013), we hypothesized that Irf8 might also be required for other YS&#8208;derived F4/80hi M&#934; populations. As expected, in the E 9.0 YS especially A2 cells expressed IRF8 as visualized in Irf8&#8208;VENUS PAC reporter mice (Fig&#160;4B).</text>

      <text>To further analyze the impact of Irf8&#8208;deficiency on tissue M&#934; under homeostatic conditions, we performed a detailed transcriptional analysis. The number of differentially expressed genes between Irf8+/+ and Irf8&#8722;/&#8722; mice was higher in the embryonic compared to the adult M&#934; cell populations (Fig&#160;6A). Moreover, Irf8 deficiency had an influence on the transcriptional pattern of both F4/80hi and CD11bhi M&#934; populations (Fig&#160;6A&#8211;C). The genes commonly up&#8208; (red) or down (blue)&#8208;regulated in embryonic and adult CD11bhi or F4/80hi M&#934; populations exhibited distinct gene ontology (GO) clusters (Fig&#160;6D). Obviously, genes related to the immune system were down&#8208;regulated in all Irf8&#8722;/&#8722; M&#934; populations suggesting an impact of IRF8 on the immune response of these cells. Quantitative RT&#8211;PCR performed with the adult M&#934; populations confirmed this finding by showing a down&#8208;regulation of Toll&#8208;like receptor 12 (Tlr12), major histocompatibility complex class II, DM alpha (H2&#8208;DMa), and basic leucine zipper transcription factor and ATF&#8208;Like 3 (Batf3) in Irf8&#8722;/&#8722; F4/80hi M&#934; (Fig&#160;6E). Moreover, Cd36, Fc fragment of IgG, high affinity Ia, receptor (Fcgr1 also known as Cd64), and Irf7 were down&#8208;regulated in Irf8&#8722;/&#8722; CD11bhi M&#934; (Fig&#160;6E). All of these genes are involved in immune response or regulation of type I interferons. Suppression of MHC class II expression on Irf8&#8722;/&#8722; M&#934; was additionally confirmed by immunohistochemistry (Fig&#160;EV5). In sum, these data provide clear evidence for an essential role of IRF8 for ensuring proper M&#934; maturation throughout development and adulthood in both F4/80hi and CD11bhi M&#934;.</text>

      <text>To date, F4/80hi M&#934; were mainly believed to be YS&#8208;derived, whereas CD11bhi M&#934; were shown to originate from the definitive hematopoiesis (Schulz et&#160;al, 2012; Gomez et&#160;al, 2015). However, this view was recently challenged by a study claiming that only microglia are YS&#8208;derived, whereas all other tissue M&#934; are fetal liver&#8208;derived (Sheng et&#160;al, 2015). In contrast, our data do not support the idea of a complete fetal liver origin of all tissue F4/80hi M&#934; except microglia but instead confirm earlier reports on the YS origin of most F4/80hi tissue M&#934; (Schulz et&#160;al, 2012; Gomez et&#160;al, 2015). These studies provided clear evidence that EMPs, localized in the YS, are the non&#8208;committed progenitors of tissue M&#934;. Our own data add exciting new facets to the YS origin of tissue M&#934;. Using a new fate&#8208;mapping strategy in Cx3cr1CreER:Rosa26&#8208;yfp mice combined with transcriptional analysis, we place the A2&#8208;progenitor population of the YS as the direct precursors of microglia and partially F4/80hi M&#934; in the liver and kidney as well as Langerhans cells. By confocal microscopy of E 9.0 and E 10.0/10.5 embryos and the E 9.0 YS, we proved that CX3CR1+ cells are exclusively present in the YS but not in the P&#8208;Sp/AGM or fetal liver at these time points and are therefore the only progenitor cells which are targeted by our fate&#8208;mapping strategy. Additionally, our results show that, except for microglia, the YS&#8208;derived F4/80hi M&#934; population in the liver and kidney as well as Langerhans cells was decreased during development suggesting a second source for these cell populations. These data support the previous findings that YS&#8208;derived Langerhans cell precursors are potentially replaced by fetal liver&#8208;derived HSCs and therefore present the main source of the adult Langerhans cells (Hoeffel et&#160;al, 2012). Our results suggest a similar scenario for adult F4/80hi M&#934; in kidney and liver. In contrast, CD11bhi M&#934; in liver and kidney were not targeted by our fate&#8208;mapping strategy demonstrating their origin from definitive hematopoiesis. Our data stand in contrast to a recent publication, which claims an exclusive origin of all M&#934; from the fetal liver (Sheng et&#160;al, 2015). Even though a contribution of bone marrow&#8208;derived HSCs to F4/80hi kidney M&#934; was previous suggested (Schulz et&#160;al, 2012), the maintenance and turnover of these cells as well as of F4/80hi Kupffer cells and CD11bhi liver M&#934; were so far not investigated. Using adult Cx3cr1CreER:Rosa26&#8208;yfp mice, we could identify a low but constant turnover rate for F4/80hi kidney M&#934; in contrast to a high turnover rate for CD11bhi M&#934;. To bypass the down&#8208;regulation of CX3CR1 expression in F4/80hi Kupffer cells during postnatal life, we directly targeted these cells after birth. So far, it was only shown indirectly that Kupffer cells have apparently no contribution from blood monocytes using either Ccr2&#8208;deficient (Bain et&#160;al, 2014) or parabiotic mice under homeostatic conditions (Epelman et&#160;al, 2014). However, a contribution of blood monocytes to F4/80hi Kupffer cells under disease conditions or after depletion was recently suggested (Bleriot et&#160;al, 2015; Scott et&#160;al, 2016). Our results provide therefore the first direct genetic proof that at least a subpopulation of the Kupffer cells has no turnover from birth until 9&#160;months of age under steady&#8208;state conditions. Recently, Clec4 has been identified as a specific gene for Kupffer cells (Scott et&#160;al, 2016) and this might open new possibilities to further study explicitly this cell population in future.</text>

      <text>A broad transcriptional analysis of different tissue M&#934; populations revealed that M&#934; gene expression is strongly dependent on the specific organ environment (Gautier et&#160;al, 2012). Moreover, separation of embryonic F4/80hi and CD11bhi tissue M&#934; by gene expression pattern was previously suggested (Schulz et&#160;al, 2012). In the present study, we additionally performed transcriptional microarray analysis of embryonic and adult F4/80hi and CD11bhi tissue M&#934; including microglia and adult Langerhans cells. Despite organ&#8208;specific expression patterns (data not shown), we identified robust similarities of F4/80hi versus CD11bhi M&#934; across organs which were present prenatally and in adulthood. Interestingly, only Langerhans cells were transcriptionally separated from both the adult F4/80hi and CD11bhi M&#934; indicating that they represent a unique tissue M&#934; population. Of note, we defined signature genes for tissue macrophages based on a previous analysis (Lavin et&#160;al, 2014) using linear support vector regression implemented in CIBERSORT (Newman et&#160;al, 2015) and could demonstrate that microglia and Kupffer cells in our analysis were mainly characterized by the same signature genes (data not shown). This suggests that our sorting strategy was compatible with previous approaches to determine tissue macrophages.</text>

      <text>PU.1 has been described as a key regulator of myeloid/macrophage development for a long time, reflected by a complete absence of mature macrophages in Pu.1&#8208;deficient animals (McKercher et&#160;al, 1996). In contrast, Irf8 was only described as a transcription factor regulating myeloid and lymphoid maturation (Holtschke et&#160;al, 1996; Hambleton et&#160;al, 2011). More recently, we described that Irf8 is essential for the maturation of the YS A1&#8208; to A2&#8208;progenitor populations (Kierdorf et&#160;al, 2013; Shiau et&#160;al, 2015). The importance of Irf8 for microglia from the early wave of hematopoiesis was also observed in zebrafish (Shiau et&#160;al, 2015). Interestingly, in their study, the impact on peripheral M&#934; was limited to the embryonic stage, whereas the effect on microglia was long&#8208;lasting. However, the role of Irf8 for other murine tissue M&#934; was not studies so far. Therefore, we analyzed if the YS&#8208;derived F4/80hi tissue M&#934; are dependent on the transcription factor Irf8 concerning maturation and homeostasis. Surprisingly, we identified a remarkably high expression of Irf8 in both F4/80hi and CD11bhi M&#934; and indeed found an impact of Irf8 on cell morphology and/or cell number of all tissue M&#934;. Moreover, Irf8 deficiency showed considerable impact on the gene expression profile of F4/80hi and CD11bhi M&#934; derived from all organs and both during embryogenesis and adulthood leading to the down&#8208;regulation of genes related to immune function. In summary, we report that F4/80hi tissue M&#934; are A2 YS progenitor&#8208;derived, whereas CD11bhi tissue M&#934; are exclusively derived from the definitive hematopoiesis independent from A2 precursors. Furthermore, we identified distinct gene profiles of the two tissue M&#934; populations. We were, for the first time, able to analyze the turnover rate of tissue M&#934; in the liver and kidney and show a low but constant turnover rate of F4/80hi kidney M&#934;, a high turnover rate for CD11bhi tissue M&#934;, and no turnover of F4/80hi liver M&#934;. Moreover, we found that Irf8 is crucial for proper maturation of microglia as well as liver and kidney M&#934;.</text>

For histology, organs were transferred to 4% PFA. For the preparation of single&#8208;cell suspension&#160;for flow cytometry, brain, liver, and kidney were cut into&#160;small pieces. The tissue of the liver and kidney was transferred&#160;to enzymatic solutions (1&#160;mg/ml collagenase D (Roche, Darmstadt, Germany)&#160;+&#160;2.4&#160;mg/ml dispase (Roche, Darmstadt, Germany)&#160;+&#160;0.2&#160;mg/ml DNase (Sigma&#8208;Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) in 1&#215;&#160;PBS for the liver and 1&#160;mg/ml collagenase D in 1&#215;&#160;PBS for the kidney) and incubated for 30&#160;min at 37&#176;C on a shaker. Cell suspensions were filtered through a mesh (100 or 70&#160;&#956;m, restrictively). The liver samples were centrifuged at 54&#160;g for 3&#160;min, 4&#176;C. Supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Liver and kidney samples were centrifuged for 5&#160;min 251&#160;g, 4&#176;C. Erythrocytes were removed by RBC lysis buffer (eBioscience, San Diego, USA). Brain tissue was homogenized and filtered through a 70&#160;&#956;m mesh. After centrifugation (10&#160;min 251&#160;g, 4&#176;C), the pellet was resuspended in 70% Percoll (Sigma&#8208;Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) and was underlay to a Percoll density gradient (30 and 37%). Density gradient centrifugation was performed for 30&#160;min, 800&#160;g at 4&#176;C without brake. Microglia were collected from the interphase 70% to 37% Percoll. For skin samples, ears were separated and dermis was put on a 0.2&#160;mg/ml dispase solution o/n 4&#176;C, dermis and epidermis were separated, and the epidermis was cut in small pieces followed by enzymatic (1.5&#160;mg/ml collagenase V, Life technologies, Darmstadt, Germany) digestion for 1.5&#160;h at 37&#176;C. Homogenates were filtered through a 100&#160;&#956;m mesh and centrifuged (251&#160;g, 5&#160;min, 4&#176;C). Cell suspensions from isolated YS were obtained by mechanical homogenization, using passage through 22&#8211;25 gauge needles as described before (Bertrand et&#160;al, 2005).</text>

      <text>The turnover rate per week was calculated as following: For CD11bhi M&#934;, the difference of YFP+ CD11bhi M&#934; at 6&#160;days to YFP+ CD11bhi M&#934; at 4&#160;weeks was defined. This value was calculated per week and then given as % of YFP+ CD11bhi M&#934; at 6&#160;days. The same calculation was done for kidney F4/80hi M&#934; using the 2&#8208;week and 35&#8208;week time point.</text>

      <text>For immunofluorescence staining with cryosections, tissues were fixed overnight at 4&#176;C, dehydrated in 30% sucrose solution, and embedded in Tissue&#8208;Tek&#174; O.C.T.TM Compound (Sakura Finetek Europ B.V., Netherlands); 12&#8208; or 30&#8208;&#956;m parasagittal sections were cut on a cryotome and mounted onto microscope slides (Langenbrinck, Emmendingen, Germany) for staining. The organ slices were fixed in acetone for 20&#160;min at &#8722;20&#176;C and rehydrated in PBS. Blocking was performed with 5% BSA, 0.1% Triton X&#8208;100 in PBS for 1&#160;h. The 12&#8208;&#956;m sections were incubated with the primary antibodies anti&#8208;GFP (1:1,000, Cat. No. 600&#8208;101&#8208;215S, Rockland, Limerick, USA) and anti&#8208;Iba1 (1:500, Cat. No. 019&#8208;19741, Wako, Osaka, Japan) in 1% BSA in PBS at 4&#176;C overnight, whereas 30&#8208;&#956;m sections were incubated with anti&#8208;F4/80 (1:200, Cat. No. MCA&#8208;497, Serotec, D&#252;sseldorf, Germany) or anti&#8208;Iba1 for two nights followed by the incubation with the secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 555, Alexa Fluor 647 or Alexa Fluor 488, 1:500, Life technologies, Darmstadt, Germany) in 1% BSA in PBS for 1&#160;h at RT in the dark. Nuclei were counterstained with 4,6&#8208;diamidino&#8208;2&#8208;phenylindole (DAPI, 1:10,000, Cat. No. 236276, Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) for 10&#8211;15&#160;min, and the slides were mounted using Mowiol (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany).

      <text>3D reconstruction of tissue macrophages was done using the IMARIS software (Bitplane, Z&#252;rich, Switzerland) as described previously (Erny et&#160;al, 2015). In brief, F4/80 or Iba&#8208;1 immunostained 30&#8208;&#956;m cryosections from adult brain, liver, and kidney were used. Imaging was performed on an Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) using a 20&#160;&#215;&#160;0.95 NA objective. Z stacks were done with 3&#215; zoom in 1.14&#160;&#956;m steps in z direction; 1,024&#160;&#215;&#160;1,024 pixel resolution was recorded and analyzed using IMARIS software (Bitplane, Z&#252;rich, Switzerland). At least six F4/80+GFP+ cells were reconstructed per analyzed mouse using the surface plug&#8208;in on the GFP or F4/80 signal.</text>

      <text>The Robust Multi&#8208;array Average (RMA) function was used to normalize the data during import of the raw Affymetrix data (CEL files) of a total of 81 samples into Partek Genomics Suite (PGS). The background value was defined as the median of the entire normalized dataset using all probes. Gene probes were only kept for further analysis if their mean expression values were higher than the background in at least one group or condition within the whole dataset. Next, multiple probes for one gene locus were filtered allowing only one probe with the highest overall mean expression. These pre&#8208;processing steps resulted in 17,888 unique genes to be present in at least one group or condition. These genes were retained for further analyses.</text>

      <text>Differentially expressed (DE) genes were defined in PGS by analysis of variance (ANOVA) models by setting certain fold change (FC) thresholds and false discovery rate [FDR, (Hochberg &amp; Benjamini, 1990)] adjusted P&#8208;value cutoffs to determine differences between two comparable groups, for example, cells derived from Irf8&#8722;/&#8722; versus Irf8+/+ mice. The respective cutoffs used for a particular comparison are described in the result section. For comparison of DE genes between different pairs of cell populations, we applied Venn diagrams. When comparing all cell populations between Irf8&#8722;/&#8722; versus Irf8+/+ mice, the absolute numbers of up&#8208; and down&#8208;regulated genes from each cell population were normalized to the number of present genes and then visualized as bar plots. The most variable genes were determined in ANOVA models to compare the variations throughout groups by t&#8208;test, that is, genes with most significant P&#8208;values. Hierarchical clustering using the Euclidean distance on both genes and samples was performed and used for visualization of DE genes between or most variable genes of particular cell populations.</text>

      <text>The differentially expressed genes comparing F4/80hi against CD11bhi in adult (755 DE genes) and embryo (1,010 DE genes) were filtered by a list of known murine cytokines (233 cytokines), by a list of antigen capturing molecules (34 molecules [Scavenger receptors in homeostasis and immunity] [Myeloid C&#8208;type Lectin Receptors in Pathogen Recognition and Host Defense]), by a list of proteolytic enzymes (754 enzymes [Twenty years of the MEROPS database of proteolytic enzymes, their substrates and inhibitors. Nucleic Acids Res 44, D343&#8208;D350]), by a list of surface markers (3,705 marker), by a list of transcription factors (929 factors [The TRANSFAC project as an example of framework technology that supports the analysis of genomic regulation]), and by a list of secreted molecules (1,139 molecules). Only the top 10 genes among the differentially expressed molecules from the above mentioned categories were visualized in a heat map using Mayday&#8211;Integrative Analytics for Expression Data (Battke et al, 2010). The top 10 genes were selected by the highest FC comparing F4/80hi against CD11bhi in adult and embryo for each category, respectively.</text>

      <text>BioLayout Express3D (BioLayout) is a powerful tool for the visualization and analysis of network graphs based on co&#8208;expression (Theocharidis et&#160;al, 2009). BioLayout was applied to discriminate different cell populations during embryonic M&#934; development. Sample&#8211;sample correlation was calculated and transformed into 3D coordinates. A Pearson's correlation coefficient cutoff of 0.92 was used to keep stronger connections (higher correlation) between samples, and subsequently, the co&#8208;regulation network was constructed and visualized in 3D space.</text>

      <text>Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and GO network visualization. To link the data to prior knowledge, GO enrichment analysis was applied by using the Cytoscape plug&#8208;in BiNGO (v2.44) (Maere et&#160;al, 2005). To include only significant results, the FDR q&#8208;value threshold was set to 0.05 as default. The Cytoscape plugins Enrichment Map (v1.1) (Merico et&#160;al, 2010) and Word Cloud (Oesper et&#160;al, 2011) were used to visualize the GO networks. To decrease the size of the networks and to define certain cutoffs for the similarity of GO terms, the default settings of Jaccard coefficients (0.25) and their FDR q&#8208;values (0.1) were utilized.</text>
