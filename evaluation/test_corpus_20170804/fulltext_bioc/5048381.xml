      <text>K63&#8208; and Met1&#8208;linked ubiquitylation are crucial posttranslational modifications for TNF receptor signaling. These non&#8208;degradative ubiquitylations are counteracted by deubiquitinases (DUBs), such as the enzyme CYLD, resulting in an appropriate signal strength, but the regulation of this process remains incompletely understood. Here, we describe an interaction partner of CYLD, SPATA2, which we identified by a mass spectrometry screen. We find that SPATA2 interacts via its PUB domain with CYLD, while a PUB interaction motif (PIM) of SPATA2 interacts with the PUB domain of the LUBAC component HOIP. SPATA2 is required for the recruitment of CYLD to the TNF receptor signaling complex upon TNFR stimulation. Moreover, SPATA2 acts as an allosteric activator for the K63&#8208; and M1&#8208;deubiquitinase activity of CYLD. In consequence, SPATA2 substantially attenuates TNF&#8208;induced NF&#8208;&#954;B and MAPK signaling. Conversely, SPATA2 is required for TNF&#8208;induced complex II formation, caspase activation, and apoptosis. Thus, this study identifies SPATA2 as an important factor in the TNF signaling pathway with a substantial role for the effects mediated by the cytokine.</text>

      <text>Non&#8208;degradative ubiquitylation is a crucial posttranslational modification for signaling through the TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). Upon TNF ligation to its receptor, K63&#8208;linked and M1&#8208;linked (linear) ubiquitylation is mediated by ubiquitin ligases, which are recruited to the TNFR1 signaling complex (TNF&#8208;RSC), such as TRAF2/5, cIAP&#8208;1 and cIAP&#8208;2, and LUBAC 1, 2, 3, 4. Upon stimulation of the TNFR1, the generation of K63&#8208;linked ubiquitin chains results in the recruitment of TAB 2 or TAB 3, and thereby the kinase TAK1, as well as the LUBAC complex 4, 5, 6. LUBAC is composed of the components SHARPIN, HOIL&#8208;1, and the enzyme HOIP, the latter providing the E3 Ligase activity. So far, LUBAC is the only known ubiquitin ligase which is able to generate M1&#8208;linked ubiquitin chains 7, 8, 9. Together, K63&#8208;linked and linear ubiquitylation of TNF&#8208;RSC constituents creates a platform for the activation of the IKK (I&#954;B kinase) complex and the MAP kinases like MKK6. These kinases mediate NF&#8208;&#954;B and AP1 transcription factor activation and thereby inflammatory cytokine expression 10.</text>

      <text>The ubiquitylation in the TNF&#8208;RSC is counter&#8208;regulated by deubiquitinases (DUBs) such as CYLD, A20, and OTULIN. Thereby, DUB activity can modify the assembly and the disassembly of the complex, respectively, and influence the strength and the outcome of TNFR signaling. Among these DUBs, the deubiquitinase CYLD is unique, as it has been shown to hydrolyze K63&#8208;linked ubiquitin chains as well as M1&#8208;linked ubiquitin chains, thereby attenuating TNFR&#8208;induced NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.</text>

      <text>Upon TNFR1 stimulation, CYLD is recruited to the TNF&#8208;RSC by the LUBAC complex through the interaction with HOIP. This requires the peptide: N&#8208;glycanase/UBA or UBX&#8208;containing protein (PUB) domain of HOIP, but it is not clear whether the interaction of HOIP and CYLD is direct or not 16. The M1&#8208;specific deubiquitinase OTULIN also interacts with LUBAC through the HOIP's PUB domain 19, 20. However, in contrast to CYLD, OTULIN is not recruited to the TNF&#8208;RSC 16. In addition, the binding of CYLD and OTULIN to HOIP was shown to be mutually exclusive, while the reason for this is not understood 16.</text>

      <text>Within hours after TNFR1 stimulation, a second complex, originating from the TNF&#8208;RSC, is forming, termed TNFR complex IIa. This complex consists of TRADD, RIPK1, FADD, caspase&#8208;8, and cFLIP and can serve as a platform to activate the initiator caspase&#8208;8. The protein cFLIP, which represents a caspase&#8208;8 homologue lacking protease activity, is transcriptionally induced upon intact NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling 21. cFLIP hetero&#8208;dimerizes with caspase&#8208;8, thereby preventing maturation and the pro&#8208;apoptotic activity of caspase&#8208;8 22.</text>

      <text>However, an alternative route to TNF&#8208;mediated cell death exists, which is not controlled by NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling. Instead, it requires the kinase activity of RIPK1 and is mediated by a complex termed TNFR complex IIb, which forms, for example, upon inhibition of cIAP1/2 23. RIPK1, in its ubiquitylated form, serves independently of its kinase activity as a scaffold in complex I. Deubiquitylation of RIPK1 was described to be mediated by CYLD, and this is thought to result in the formation of complex IIb consisting of RIPK1, FADD, and caspase&#8208;8, mediating caspase&#8208;8 activation 11, 24. Thus, in the context of cell death regulation, the deubiquitinase activity of CYLD plays a central role, as CYLD was demonstrated to be required for TNF&#8208;induced cell apoptosis and necroptosis 25. The regulation of CYLD activity itself within the TNF&#8208;RSC, however, remains elusive.</text>

      <text>The opposite effect on cell death was observed for the LUBAC component HOIP. Mice with a homozygous deletion of HOIP exhibit mid&#8208;gestation embryonic lethality, which is mediated by the TNFR1, and HOIP knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are prone to TNF&#8208;induced cell death 26.</text>

      <text>To explore the regulation of CYLD, we performed a SILAC mass spectrometry experiment, in order to identify novel interaction partners of CYLD, potentially impacting on its regulation. CYLD&#8722;/&#8722; MEFs were infected with retrovirus encoding FLAG&#8208;CYLD or were left uninfected as a control, followed by a labeling of the two different populations with the respective isotopes. The cells were then treated with TNF, subjected to a FLAG&#8208;IP, and after mixing the two conditions, the CYLD interactome was analyzed (Fig 1A). Among a number of identified interactors, we found the by far highest heavy/light ratio for the protein SPATA2 (spermatogenesis&#8208;associated protein 2), identifying it as a promising candidate as a novel interaction partner of CYLD (Fig 1B).</text>

      <text>We first aimed at confirming the interaction between CYLD and SPATA2. Consistent with the results obtained by SILAC&#8208;MS, FLAG&#8208;tagged full&#8208;length CYLD, expressed in 293T cells, co&#8208;immunoprecipitated endogenously expressed SPATA2. The interaction with SPATA2 was also observed by immunoprecipitation of a FLAG&#8208;tagged C&#8208;terminal fragment of CYLD (CYLD 581&#8211;956), whereas an N&#8208;terminal fragment of CYLD (CYLD 1&#8211;581) did not interact with SPATA2 (Fig 1C). This interaction was also confirmed using CYLD&#8722;/&#8722; MEFs expressing FLAG&#8208;CYLD. Again, an anti&#8208;FLAG antibody co&#8208;immunoprecipitated endogenous SPATA2 (Fig 1D). The substantial enrichment of SPATA2 by co&#8208;immunoprecipitation with CYLD is consistent with a high affinity interaction.</text>

      <text>In a reverse approach, we expressed FLAG&#8208;SPATA2 in 293T cells and, in line with previous experiments, we were able to detect a co&#8208;immunoprecipitation of endogenous CYLD. A construct lacking the C&#8208;terminal part of SPATA2, but retaining the N&#8208;terminus including the PUB domain of the protein, co&#8208;immunoprecipitated CYLD to a similar extent. This demonstrated that SPATA2 binds CYLD via the N&#8208;terminal part of SPATA2, which contains the PUB domain of SPATA2 (Fig 1E).</text>

      <text>As SPATA2 interacts with CYLD, we postulated that SPATA2 is the bridging factor between CYLD and HOIP. We therefore tested whether SPATA2 interacts with HOIP. Indeed, we found that FLAG&#8208;HOIP co&#8208;immunoprecipitated with SPATA2 (Fig 2A). As shown previously for CYLD, the interaction of SPATA2 and HOIP also depended on an intact PUB domain of HOIP, as a PUB domain mutant, HOIPN102A, exhibited a largely reduced interaction with SPATA2 (Fig 2A).</text>

      <text>The M1&#8208;specific deubiquitinase OTULIN, which has been shown to also interact with the PUB domain of HOIP, requires a PUB interaction motif (PIM) for this association 19, 20. We tested the possibility that the interaction of SPATA2 and HOIP also depends on a PIM in SPATA2. We observed that SPATA2 contains a region with similarity to the OTULIN PIM and generated a SPATA2 PIM mutant in analogy to the OTULIN PIM Y56A mutation (which compromises the interaction of OTULIN with HOIP), by generating a SPATA2Y338A mutant 19, 20. As shown in Fig 2B, this SPATA2 mutant exhibited largely reduced binding to HOIP, while the interaction with CYLD was not affected. Together, these results demonstrate that SPATA2 interacts via a PUB interaction motif (PIM) with the PUB domain of HOIP.</text>

Strikingly, when we analyzed endogenous OTULIN, which co&#8208;immunoprecipitated with HOIP, we found that high expression of SPATA2 abrogated the binding of OTULIN to HOIP (Fig 2C). This indicates that it is the competition of SPATA2 and OTULIN, which underlies the mutual exclusive binding of CYLD and OTULIN to the LUBAC complex. Consistently, a direct interaction of SPATA2 and OTULIN did not take place (Fig 2D).</text>

      <text>Together, these data suggest that SPATA2 is a bridging protein between HOIP and CYLD. As HOIP recruits CYLD to the TNF&#8208;RSC, SPATA2 should also be recruited to the TNF&#8208;RSC upon TNF stimulation. To test this, we stimulated A549 cells with FLAG&#8208;tagged TNF, followed by FLAG&#8208;IP of the receptor complex, at various time points. We found that SPATA2 was recruited with similar kinetics to the TNF&#8208;RSC as TRADD, RIPK1, SHARPIN, and CYLD (Fig 2F). This finding identifies SPATA2 as a component of the TNF&#8208;RSC.</text>

      <text>To address this question, A549 cells expressing CRISPR/Cas9, targeting SPATA2, were generated. These cells were treated with FLAG&#8208;tagged TNF, followed by FLAG&#8208;IP of the receptor complex at various time points. As shown in Fig 3A, CYLD recruitment to the TNF&#8208;RSC was compromised to the same extent as the recruitment of SPATA2 in cells which were infected with CRISPR/Ca9 targeting SPATA2. This indicated that SPATA2 mediates the interaction between CYLD and HOIP. Importantly, the recruitment of HOIP and SHARPIN to the TNF&#8208;RSC was not affected upon SPATA2 reduction (Fig 3A).</text>

Upon treatment with FLAG&#8208;tagged TNF, followed by FLAG&#8208;IP of the receptor complex, CYLD recruitment to the TNF&#8208;RSC was increased only in the presence of SPATA2 corroborating the results we had obtained with A549 cells (Fig 3B).</text>

      <text>Linear ubiquitylation was reported to be the predominant linkage type in the TNFR signaling pathway 33. For this reason, and because CYLD is capable of counteracting M1&#8208;linked ubiquitylation, we specifically asked whether the absence of SPATA2&#8208;dependent recruitment of CYLD to the TNF&#8208;RSC results in increased M1&#8208;ubiquitylation on the TNF&#8208;RSC 14, 15. We tested this possibility using an antibody which is specific for M1&#8208;ubiquitin chains 34. Indeed, upon stimulation and isolation of the TNF&#8208;RSC with FLAG&#8208;HA&#8208;tagged TNF, the complexes from SPATA2 knockout cells exhibited increased M1&#8208;ubiquitylation (Fig 3B).</text>

      <text>In principle, the absence of SPATA2, and therefore, the lack of CYLD recruitment to the TNF&#8208;RSC, would explain the increased M1&#8208;ubiquitylation we observed. However, we considered the possibility that the strong direct interaction of SPATA2 and CYLD could have effects on the enzymatic activity of CYLD. CYLD had been shown previously to cleave M1&#8208; and K63&#8208;, but not K48&#8208;linked ubiquitin chains 14, 15. We tested this hypothesis in a DUB activity assay by combining recombinant M1&#8208;, K63&#8208;, and K48&#8208;linked diubiquitin with purified FLAG&#8208;CYLD, co&#8208;expressed with or without SPATA2, to assess CYLD DUB activity.</text>

      <text>We first retrovirally expressed FLAG&#8208;CYLDwt or the inactive mutant FLAG&#8208;CYLDC598A in CYLD&#8722;/&#8722; MEFs. These cells were infected with retrovirus encoding SPATA2, or control retrovirus. FLAG&#8208;CYLD was isolated by FLAG&#8208;IP and, as expected, SPATA2 co&#8208;purified with CYLD. The association did not depend on the enzyme activity of CYLD, as the inactive mutant FLAG&#8208;CYLDC598A also co&#8208;immunoprecipitated SPATA2 (Fig 4A&#8211;C). The purified proteins were then combined with M1&#8208;, K63&#8208;, or K48&#8208;linked diubiquitin substrate. As expected, and consistent with data from others, wild&#8208;type CYLD mediated proteolysis of the M1&#8208; and K63&#8208;linked diubiquitin, while the inactive CYLDC598A mutant did not 14. When assaying the DUB activity of FLAG&#8208;CYLD, which had been expressed in the presence of co&#8208;introduced SPATA2, we consistently observed an increased loss of the band representing diubiquitin, while the band representing mono&#8208;ubiquitin gained intensity (Fig 4A and B). In contrast, and consistent with previous findings by others, CYLD did not process K48&#8208;linked diubiquitins, and this was not influenced by the presence or absence of SPATA2 14, 15 (Fig 4C).</text>

      <text>Linear and K63&#8208;linked ubiquitylation are essential for inflammatory cytokine signaling and the prevention of TNF&#8208;mediated cell death 7, 23, 26. As CYLD has been shown to counteract linear and K63&#8208;linked ubiquitylation 14 and our data demonstrate that SPATA2 and CYLD might cooperate for this function, we explored whether SPATA2 has an influence on the activation of NF&#8208;&#954;B and MAPK signaling by TNF. To answer this question, MEFs lacking and retaining SPATA2 were generated by use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system and analyzed for NF&#8208;&#954;B and MAPK signaling. Upon treatment with TNF, SPATA2 knockout cells exhibited accelerated I&#954;B&#945; degradation as well as increased phosphorylation of p65, I&#954;B&#945;, JNK, p38, and ERK, as compared to control cells infected with a CRISPR/Cas9 construct targeting luciferase (Fig 5A).</text>

Strikingly, we found substantially reduced caspase&#8208;3 and PARP cleavage in cells lacking SPATA2. Necrostatin&#8208;1 suppressed caspase activation, indicating that the death signal, promoted by SPATA2, is dependent on RIPK1 activity (Fig 5C).</text>

Likewise, the proportion of apoptotic, Annexin V&#8208;positive cells was substantially reduced in cells deficient for SPATA2 (Fig 5E). These results suggested that SPATA2 affects the formation of complex II. Therefore, we performed a FADD immunoprecipitation to isolate complex II using lysates from TAK1&#8722;/&#8722; cells lacking or retaining SPATA2 after treatment with TNF. We observed an interaction of RIPK1 with FADD in SPATA2 wild&#8208;type cells, while in SPATA2 ko cells, the interaction of RIPK1 with FADD was largely reduced, indicating an abrogated formation of the TNFR complex II (Fig 5F).</text>

      <text>Our finding that SPATA2 promotes CYLD activity suggests two ways as to how SPATA2 promotes CYLD activity at the TNF&#8208;RSC. First, SPATA2 recruits CYLD to the TNF&#8208;RSC via its direct interaction with HOIP, and secondly, it promotes CYLD activity within the complex through an allosteric activation of the DUB. This mechanism suggests a role of SPATA2 as an important modulator for appropriate innate immune signaling. Indeed, our data show that the loss of SPATA2 substantially promoted NF&#8208;&#954;B and MAPK activation, and, strikingly, the absence of SPATA2 almost completely abrogated TNF&#8208;induced apoptosis.</text>

      <text>In initial reports, the most abundant expression of SPATA2 was observed in Sertoli cells of the testes, leading to the interpretation of a role of SPATA2 for spermatogenesis. However, while speculative, our finding that SPATA2 attenuates NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling is also compatible with the interpretation that the high expression levels of SPATA2 play a role for the immune privilege of testes. Interestingly, in one study on CYLD knockout mice, male CYLD&#8722;/&#8722; mice were reported to be infertile, which was explained by an absence of an early wave of germ cell apoptosis 11. We speculate that it is also possible that unchecked innate immune signaling may have resulted in this phenotype, and SPATA2 knockout mice will be informative to further explore this hypothesis.</text>

      <text>CYLD had been shown in a shRNA library screen with L929 cells to be required for apoptosis and necroptosis 25. It is not clear how exactly CYLD promotes TNF&#8208;induced cell death, and the molecular mechanism how SPATA2 acts in this context remains to be determined as well. We show that complex II formation is compromised in the absence of SPATA2. CYLD had been shown to deubiquitylate RIPK1, which was suggested to promote TNF&#8208;induced cell death 11, 24. Thus, the cell death&#8208;promoting role of SPATA2, which we have observed, would be compatible with the enhanced the DUB activity of CYLD, resulting in RIPK1 deubiquitylation. However, in agreement with data from others, we find RIPK1 to be ubiquitylated in complex II, indicating that the role RIPK1 ubiquitylation plays for cell death prevention has yet to be clarified 42, 44.</text>

      <text>In conclusion, with SPATA2 we have identified a so far unknown important component in the TNF receptor signaling pathway. Since it is very likely that this protein plays also a role for other innate immunity signaling pathways such as TLR or NOD signaling, our findings represent an important step toward a deeper understanding of the regulation of innate immunity.</text>

      <text>In order to generate SPATA2 ko cells, the lentiCRISPRv2 system was used as described by others 35. Therefore, three lentiviral vectors were designed encoding for three different guide RNAs targeting different sequences of exon 1 within the Spata2 gene. As control, a lentiviral vector was designed encoding for a guide RNA targeting luciferase sequence (Table 1). The production of lentiviral particles and subsequent infection and selection of target cells was performed as described for retroviral transduction above, using lentiviral packaging vectors. In this case 5 &#956;g of lentiCRISPRv2 vector, 1.5 &#956;g pMISSIONVSV&#8208;G (Sigma&#8208;Aldrich) and 3 &#956;g pMISSION GAG POL (Sigma&#8208;Aldrich) were transfected using PEI. Infected cells were selected using 4 &#956;g/ml puromycin for 4 days and mixed cultures were tested for Cas9 cleavage efficiency and NHEJ repair by performing a Surveyor assay. To do so, the exon 1 region of the Spata2 gene was amplified by PCR (primers used: 5&#8242;: GGCACCAGTCAGAAGGGTAA; 3&#8242;: CCAGGATGTCCATTTTGAGC). Then, the Surveyor assay was performed according to manufacturers' protocol (Integrated DNA technologies) to detect mismatches due to mutations, indicating Cas9 nuclease cleavage and repair by NHEJ. Single cell clones were generated and shifts in the open reading frame generating a premature STOP codon were verified via sequencing. Clones with identical deletions on both alleles resulting in a premature STOP codon were chosen (Figs EV1 and EV3). Control cell lines transfected with luciferase control vector were used as mixed cultures. In case of the A549 cell line, mixed cultures were used, without generating single clones.</text>

Beads were washed three times using lysis buffer. In the final wash step, the beads of both conditions were combined and protein complexes were eluted by adding Laemmli buffer (containing 50 mM DTT) diluted in lysis buffer. For MS sample preparation and measurements, samples were prepared with 1 mM DTT for 5 min at 95&#176;C and alkylated using 5.5 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at 25&#176;C.

      <text>Samples analyzed by MS were measured on LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled either to an Agilent 1200 nanoflow HPLC (Agilent Technologies) or an Eksigent NanoLC&#8208;ultra. HPLC&#8208;column tips (fused silica) with 75 &#956;m inner diameter were self&#8208;packed with Reprosil&#8208;Pur 120 ODS&#8208;3 to a length of 20 cm. No pre&#8208;column was used. Peptides were injected at a flow of 500 nl/min in 92% buffer A (0.5% acetic acid in HPLC gradient grade water) and 2% buffer B (0.5% acetic acid in 80% acetonitrile, 20% water). Separation was achieved by a linear gradient from 10 to 30% of buffer B at a flow rate of 250 nl/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in the data&#8208;dependent mode and switched automatically between MS (max. of 1 &#215; 10 ions) and MS/MS. Each MS scan was followed by a maximum of five MS/MS scans in the linear ion trap using normalized collision energy of 35% and a target value of 5,000. Parent ions with a charge states of z = 1 and unassigned charge states were excluded from fragmentation. The mass range for MS was m/z = 370&#8211;2,000. The resolution was set to 60,000. MS parameters were as follows: spray voltage 2.3 kV; no sheath and auxiliary gas flow; ion transfer tube temperature 125&#176;C.</text>
