      <text>Homologous recombination (HR) is a key pathway that repairs DNA double&#8208;strand breaks (DSBs) and helps to restart stalled or collapsed replication forks. How HR supports replication upon genotoxic stress is not understood. Using in&#160;vivo and in&#160;vitro approaches, we show that the MMS22L&#8211;TONSL heterodimer localizes to replication forks under unperturbed conditions and its recruitment is increased during replication stress in human cells. MMS22L&#8211;TONSL associates with replication protein A (RPA)&#8208;coated ssDNA, and the MMS22L subunit directly interacts with the strand exchange protein RAD51. MMS22L is required for proper RAD51 assembly at DNA damage sites in&#160;vivo, and HR&#8208;mediated repair of stalled forks is abrogated in cells expressing a MMS22L mutant deficient in RAD51 interaction. Similar to the recombination mediator BRCA2, recombinant MMS22L&#8211;TONSL limits the assembly of RAD51 on dsDNA, which stimulates RAD51&#8208;ssDNA nucleoprotein filament formation and RAD51&#8208;dependent strand exchange activity in&#160;vitro. Thus, by specifically regulating RAD51 activity at uncoupled replication forks, MMS22L&#8211;TONSL stabilizes perturbed replication forks by promoting replication fork reversal and stimulating their HR&#8208;mediated restart in&#160;vivo.</text>

      <text>All cells must replicate their DNA before each round of cell division. In humans, genome duplication is critically dependent on homologous recombination (HR), which protects stalled replication forks or restores integrity of collapsed forks (San Filippo et&#160;al, 2008). Recombination mechanisms are largely studied in the context of DSB repair, yet endogenous two&#8208;ended DSBs are relatively rare and usually repaired by a non&#8208;homologous end&#8208;joining pathway in mammals. In contrast, HR is required for the completion of replication even in the absence of exogenous DNA damage, as recombination&#8208;deficient human cells undergo only a very limited number of DNA replication rounds. However, how recombination supports replication remains mostly undefined (Petermann &amp; Helleday, 2010; Neelsen &amp; Lopes, 2015). Furthermore, mutations in several regulatory HR genes including breast cancer susceptibility protein 2 (BRCA2) or RAD51C predispose affected individuals to cancer, demonstrating that aberrant HR results in genome instability that drives tumorigenesis (Wooster et&#160;al, 1995; Meindl et&#160;al, 2010).</text>

      <text>A key player in the HR&#8208;mediated processes is the RAD51 recombinase, which assembles on ssDNA upon nuclease&#8208;mediated resection of the broken DNA ends. RAD51 nucleoprotein filament then invades homologous DNA, which serves as the repair template. The assembly of RAD51 filaments on ssDNA is regulated at multiple levels. First, resected ssDNA is rapidly coated and protected by RPA, which coordinates DNA damage signaling and repair. However, as RPA also competes with RAD51 for binding to ssDNA, proteins termed recombination mediators are required to load RAD51 on the RPA&#8208;coated ssDNA. This overcomes the inhibitory effect of RPA on RAD51&#8208;mediated DNA strand exchange and represents an important regulatory step that allows recombination on appropriate DNA substrates. These mediators including BRCA2 and the five RAD51 paralogues RAD51B/C/D and XRCC2/3 (San Filippo et&#160;al, 2008) help to form the RAD51&#8208;ssDNA filament in the presence of RPA, and particularly BRCA2 also prevents assembly of RAD51 on dsDNA (Sigurdsson et&#160;al, 2001b; Jensen et&#160;al, 2010; Liu et&#160;al, 2010; Thorslund et&#160;al, 2010; Taylor et&#160;al, 2015). However, although the recombination mediators appear to be key to understand how HR is fine&#8208;tuned, their exact roles and interplay at DNA damage sites are still poorly understood.</text>

      <text>The human MMS22L&#8211;TONSL complex and its budding yeast counterpart Mms22 play essential roles during DNA replication stress but their precise function remains elusive (Luke et&#160;al, 2006; Duro et&#160;al, 2008, 2010; O'Connell et&#160;al, 2010; O'Donnell et&#160;al, 2010; Piwko et&#160;al, 2010). Yeast Mms22 was proposed to be a putative substrate adaptor of the Rtt101 cullin E3 ubiquitin ligase functioning downstream of the histone H3&#8208;K56 acetylation pathway, which marks newly replicated DNA and is required for genome stability maintenance (Collins et&#160;al, 2007; Zaidi et&#160;al, 2008). Human cells expressing low levels of MMS22L or TONSL as well as yeast mms22&#916; mutants are hypersensitive to drugs such as camptothecin (CPT) inducing replication fork reversal or DSBs at replication forks, but not to ionizing radiation, suggesting specific defects in dealing with replication fork stalling or collapse (Luke et&#160;al, 2006; Duro et&#160;al, 2008, 2010; O'Connell et&#160;al, 2010; O'Donnell et&#160;al, 2010; Piwko et&#160;al, 2010; Ray Chaudhuri et&#160;al, 2012; Buser et&#160;al, 2016). Cells lacking MMS22L were unable to restart replication forks stalled upon treatment with CPT and were defective in RAD51 foci formation at collapsed replication forks and DSBs, and thus, MMS22L was suggested to act as a recombination mediator (Duro et&#160;al, 2010; O'Donnell et&#160;al,&#160;2010). The TONSL subunit is a reader of unmethylated histone H4 tails that mark newly replicated DNA, which was proposed to facilitate recombination when newly replicated DNA is&#160;available as a template for HR&#8208;based repair (Saredi et&#160;al, 2016).&#160;However, evidence for a direct involvement of MMS22L&#8211;TONSL in recombination has been missing. To this point, Arabidopsis thaliana TONSL homologue TONSOKU/BRU1 was implicated in reestablishing the chromatin state after DNA replication and&#160;TONSOKU mutants are characterized by loss of a transcriptional silencing phenotype closely resembling the phenotype exhibited with defects in chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF&#8208;1)&#160;(Takeda et&#160;al, 2004). Moreover, both yeast Mms22 and human MMS22L&#8211;TONSL&#160;were found in complexes with histones and chromatin remodeling factors, raising the possibility that they&#160;may act indirectly by regulating the chromatin milieu or the&#160;mobility of&#160;broken DNA (Duro et&#160;al, 2010; O'Connell et&#160;al, 2010; O'Donnell&#160;et&#160;al, 2010; Piwko et&#160;al, 2010; Buser et&#160;al, 2016).</text>

      <text>Here, we report that MMS22L&#8211;TONSL is present at replication&#160;forks under unperturbed conditions and its presence is enhanced at collapsed replication forks that had undergone extensive resection. MMS22L&#8211;TONSL recruitment to replication fork stall sites is facilitated via a direct interaction with RPA&#8208;coated ssDNA. Its activity at stalled replication forks leads to replication fork protection by RAD51&#8208;dependent fork reversal. We demonstrate that purified MMS22L&#8211;TONSL directly binds the RAD51 recombinase and favors the interaction of RAD51 with ssDNA, which promotes the formation of RAD51 presynaptic filaments and invasion of homologous DNA. These data demonstrate a direct involvement of MMS22L&#8211;TONSL in RAD51&#8208;dependent recombination and establish the heterodimer as a key factor that functions as a recombination regulator at stalled replication forks.</text>

      <text>MMS22L&#8211;TONSL accumulates as nuclear foci upon induction of DSBs in human cells (Duro et&#160;al, 2010; O'Donnell et&#160;al, 2010). To determine whether MMS22L recruitment to DSBs is cell cycle&#8208;regulated,&#160;we treated synchronized HeLa cells with the Topo II inhibitor etoposide. As expected, etoposide induced DSBs in all cell cycle phases, demonstrated by &#947;H2AX foci accumulation (Nitiss, 2009), but only S&#8208;phase cells showed MMS22L foci (Figs&#160;1A and B, and EV1A&#8211;C). When replication was inhibited by the polymerase&#8208;alpha inhibitor aphidicolin, the number of etoposide&#8208;induced MMS22L foci in S&#8208;phase cells was strongly reduced (Fig&#160;EV1D and E), suggesting that MMS22L is not generally recruited to DNA breaks but rather acts preferentially in the context of replication forks. Since Saccharomyces cerevisiae mms22&#916; cells are severely impaired in HR specifically induced by drugs that inhibit DNA replication&#160;(Duro et&#160;al, 2008), the function of MMS22L in promoting replication&#8208;linked recombination appears conserved in evolution.</text>

      <text>Key HR players such as RPA, recombination mediator BRCA2, and the strand exchange protein RAD51 accumulate as nuclear foci at DSBs (Raderschall et&#160;al, 1999; Tarsounas et&#160;al, 2004). To better understand the nature of replication stress&#8208;induced MMS22L foci, we investigated their colocalization and dependence on RPA, BRCA2, and RAD51 in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells. We observed that 47% BRCA2 and 43% RAD51 foci colocalized with MMS22L at stalled replication fork sites upon prolonged treatment with the Topo I inhibitor camptothecin (CPT) (Fig&#160;1C and D), indicating that MMS22L cooperates or functions alongside BRCA2 in the assembly of RAD51 presynaptic filaments at these sites. Colocalization of MMS22L foci was greatest with RPA2 (~63%) and the RPA2 and MMS22L foci signal intensity correlated with each other upon various replication stress conditions (Fig&#160;EV1F). Moreover, disrupting RPA accumulation upon replication stress by the depletion of the DNA end resection factor CtIP strongly reduced the number of MMS22L foci (Sartori et&#160;al, 2007; O'Donnell et&#160;al, 2010) (Fig&#160;EV1G and H), suggesting that RPA may recruit MMS22L&#8211;TONSL to stalled replication forks.</text>

      <text>To understand the recruitment of the complex to replication stress sites at the molecular level, we assessed whether MMS22L&#8211;TONSL directly interacts with ssDNA and RPA. We purified the full&#8208;length recombinant heterodimer and the MMS22L subunit from Sf9 cells (Fig&#160;EV2A and B). TONSL expressed without MMS22L was rapidly degraded and could not be obtained. On its own, recombinant MMS22L&#8211;TONSL was incapable to stably bind oligonucleotide&#8208;based DNA (data not shown, see also below), and we could only observe binding to plasmid&#8208;length DNA, which likely reflects its low DNA binding affinity (Fig&#160;EV2C). This limited DNA binding largely depends on the TONSL subunit, as the DNA&#8208;binding capacity of MMS22L was even lower than that of the heterodimer (Fig&#160;EV2D). Additionally, no difference between MMS22L&#8211;TONSL binding to ssDNA and dsDNA was observed (Fig&#160;EV2C). In solution, MMS22L&#8211;TONSL bound recombinant RPA directly but with a weak affinity (Fig&#160;EV2E and F), which could also be recapitulated in a yeast two&#8208;hybrid assay (Fig&#160;EV2G; note that the MMS22L subunit interacts directly with RPA). However, when we pre&#8208;bound RPA to ssDNA and introduced MMS22L&#8211;TONSL (Fig&#160;2A and B, lanes 6&#8211;10, and Fig&#160;EV2H&#8211;L), we observed a novel band likely corresponding to the ternary MMS22L&#8211;TONSL&#8208;RPA&#8208;ssDNA complex, since MMS22L&#8211;TONSL does not bind oligonucleotide&#8208;based ssDNA in the absence of RPA (Figs&#160;2A and EV2H, I and K, lanes 1&#8211;5). To verify these findings, we performed streptavidin pulldowns of biotinylated ssDNA incubated with RPA and His&#8208;tagged MMS22L&#8211;TONSL. We detected MMS22L&#8211;TONSL only when RPA was present in the reaction (Fig&#160;2C, compare lanes 3 and 5). Likewise, in NiNTA pulldowns, more RPA was obtained in reactions containing ssDNA (Fig&#160;2C, compare lanes 6 and 7). Thus, MMS22L&#8211;TONSL forms a stable complex with RPA bound to ssDNA, which is dependent on the MMS22L subunit (Fig&#160;EV2K&#8211;M). MMS22L&#8211;TONSL failed to form&#160;a complex with ssDNA coated with human mitochondrial ssDNA&#8208;binding protein (mtSSB), indicating that the binding to ssDNA&#8208;RPA is specific (Fig&#160;EV2N). Pulldowns with MMS22L fragments mapped the RPA interaction site to the N&#8208;terminal part of MMS22L (Fig&#160;EV3A), which could be further narrowed by yeast two&#8208;hybrid assay to a MMS22L region between residues 384 and 522 (Fig&#160;2D). This site corresponds to the MMS22L sequence that we previously identified as the region with strongest homology to yeast Mms22 protein (Piwko et&#160;al, 2010), implying that the RPA&#8208;binding domain is evolutionarily conserved. While the MMS22L &#916;384&#8211;522 mutant protein was unable to bind RPA, it still interacted with TONSL (Fig&#160;EV3B). Importantly, the MMS22L &#916;384&#8211;522 mutant deficient in the interaction with RPA was incapable to localize to CPT&#8208;induced &#947;H2AX foci in U2OS cells (Fig&#160;2E), consistent with results using transiently overexpressed truncated MMS22L variants lacking this region (Fig&#160;EV3C). We conclude that the RPA interaction facilitates MMS22L&#8211;TONSL recruitment to ssDNA present at or behind stalled and collapsed replication forks to promote their HR&#8208;mediated restart.</text>

      <text>We next wanted to understand whether MMS22L&#8211;TONSL acts directly at DNA replication forks. To assess MMS22L&#8211;TONSL dynamics at replication forks, we employed the isolation of proteins on nascent DNA (iPOND) assay (Sirbu et&#160;al, 2011) based on affinity purification of DNA pulse&#8208;labeled during replication with the thymidine analog ethynyl&#8208;deoxyuridine (EdU). We found both MMS22L and TONSL proteins at active forks with unperturbed conditions, and binding was strongly reduced to fully replicated chromatin (Fig&#160;3A; compare lane 9 with lanes 10&#8211;12). Hydroxyurea (HU) addition to stalled forks led to a prolonged MMS22L&#8211;TONSL retention on the nascent DNA (Fig&#160;3A; lanes 13&#8211;16), suggesting that the complex functions directly at stalled replication forks. These results are in agreement with a recent study using an iPOND technology coupled to mass spectrometry analysis, which also detected MMS22L and TONSL at replication forks (Dungrawala et&#160;al, 2015). We next stalled forks with a 30&#8208;min CPT treatment, followed by drug washout to monitor the recovery process over time. We observed gradual RPA2 reduction along with loading of the RAD51 recombinase directly to forks (Figs&#160;3B and C, and EV4A), and the MMS22L dynamics followed exchange of RPA for RAD51. As the MMS22L&#8211;TONSL complex is required for RAD51 foci formation upon DNA damage (Duro et&#160;al, 2010; O'Donnell et&#160;al, 2010), we next tested whether MMS22L&#8211;TONSL is required to recruit RAD51 to stalled forks. Using the CPT&#8208;recovery assay with cells depleted for MMS22L or TONSL, we observed a strong RAD51 reduction at CPT&#8208;stalled forks in the absence of either MMS22L (Fig&#160;3D and E) or TONSL (Fig&#160;EV4C and D). Moreover, ectopic expression of TONSL mutants defective in MMS22L interaction reduced RAD51 recruitment to stalled forks (Fig&#160;EV4B&#8211;D), indicating that an association of both components of the complex is required to promote RAD51 loading. These data strongly suggest that MMS22L&#8211;TONSL is involved in efficient recruitment and/or maintenance of the RAD51 recombinase directly on DNA replication forks immediately upon stalling.</text>

      <text>Stalled replication forks either may collapse resulting in single&#8208;ended DSBs or may be transiently stabilized through fork reversal (Neelsen &amp; Lopes, 2015). Micromolar CPT concentrations that induce replication&#8208;associated DSBs resulted in early MMS22L foci (Fig&#160;EV5A&#8211;C). In contrast, nanomolar CPT or HU that stall replication forks but do not lead to early DSBs (Petermann et&#160;al, 2010; Ray Chaudhuri et&#160;al, 2012) did not result in detectable MMS22L foci at similar time points (Fig&#160;EV5A&#8211;C). MMS22L foci number and intensity were strongly increased in HU&#8208;treated cells upon ATR kinase inhibition, which leaves stalled forks unprotected leading to fork collapse (Cimprich &amp; Cortez, 2008) (Fig&#160;EV5D and E). These observations suggest that MMS22L foci detectable by conventional microscopy mainly form upon DNA breakage, and thus also implicate MMS22L&#8211;TONSL in the recombination&#8208;mediated repair of collapsed replication forks (Fig&#160;1). However, although MMS22L&#8211;TONSL is also recruited to stalled forks early to support replication fork restart (Fig&#160;3A), this process does not create visible MMS22L foci (Fig&#160;EV5A&#8211;C).</text>

      <text>Recently, RAD51 activity at CPT&#8208;stalled forks has been linked to fork reversal in human cells (Zellweger et&#160;al, 2015). This first response to fork stalling allows transient fork pausing and was proposed as a mechanism to avoid collision with lesions or gaps on template DNA, thus preventing fork collapse (Neelsen &amp; Lopes, 2015). Importantly, lack of MMS22L prevents RAD51 foci formation as early as 1&#160;h after nanomolar CPT treatment (Figs&#160;4A and B, and EV5F). Electron microscopy analysis of in&#160;vivo psoralen&#8208;cross&#8208;linked replication intermediates from MMS22L&#8208;depleted U2OS cells revealed a marked reduction (~60%) in the frequency of CPT&#8208;induced reversed forks (Figs&#160;4C&#8211;E and EV5G), similar to defects recently reported upon depletion of RAD51 (Zellweger et&#160;al, 2015). Moreover, forks in CPT&#8208;treated MMS22L&#8208;depleted cells displayed significantly longer ssDNA regions (Fig&#160;4D and F), strongly suggesting that MMS22L&#8211;TONSL is recruited to extended ssDNA gaps on template DNA, thereby assisting fork reversal by loading RAD51 at these sites.</text>

      <text>The functional association of MMS22L&#8211;TONSL with RAD51 prompted us to test for a direct physical interaction between RAD51 and the heterodimer. We immobilized MBP&#8208;tagged MMS22L&#8211;TONSL or MMS22L on amylose resin and performed pulldowns with recombinant RAD51. We found that MMS22L&#8211;TONSL directly interacts with RAD51 (Fig&#160;5A), with up to two RAD51 molecules tightly bound by the heterodimer (we estimate the affinity in the nanomolar range, Figs&#160;5B and EV6A). MMS22L&#8211;TONSL binds RAD51 with similar affinities as the MMS22L subunit (Fig&#160;EV6B&#8211;D), suggesting that the interaction is mediated by MMS22L. This direct physical interaction between MMS22L and RAD51 was confirmed by yeast two&#8208;hybrid assays (Fig&#160;5C). To define the RAD51 interaction region in MMS22L, we searched for the previously described FXXA motif present in the BRC repeats of BRCA2, RECQ5L, and other RAD51&#8208;interacting proteins (Islam et&#160;al, 2012) and found three of these motifs in MMS22L (Fig&#160;5D). Whereas mutating either of the first two motifs had no effect on the interaction with RAD51, F1034A A1037D mutation dramatically reduced the capacity of MMS22L to interact with RAD51 in yeast two&#8208;hybrid assays, and an identical result was observed upon mutation of a single phenylalanine residue at position F1034 (Fig&#160;5D). Consistent with these results, purified recombinant MMS22L F1034A (FA)&#8208;TONSL heterodimer failed to interact with RAD51 in&#160;vitro (Fig&#160;5E), while the MMS22L FA mutation did not affect the interaction with RPA (Fig&#160;5F) or TONSL in&#160;vivo or in&#160;vitro (Figs&#160;5G and EV6E). To determine the effects of MMS22L mutations on the response to replication fork stalling by CPT or DSBs induced by ETP in&#160;vivo, we created stable&#160;U2OS cell lines expressing siRNA&#8208;resistant HSS (HA&#8208;2x Strep)&#8208;tagged RAD51 interaction&#8208;deficient MMS22L FA or RPA interaction&#8208;deficient MMS22L &#916;384&#8211;522 variants under the control of doxycycline&#8208;inducible promoter. Upon downregulation of endogenous MMS22L by RNAi, the mutant proteins were expressed as the sole variant of MMS22L in these cells. We noted that the CPT&#8208;induced foci of MMS22L FA mutant are weaker than the ones formed by the wild&#8208;type protein (Fig&#160;EV6F), suggesting that binding of MMS22L&#8211;TONSL to RAD51 (presumably nucleofilaments) stabilizes the heterodimer at DNA damage sites. Strikingly, whereas the wild&#8208;type MMS22L was capable to restore DNA damage&#8208;dependent RAD51 foci upon all tested conditions, the two MMS22L variants failed to do so (Figs&#160;5H&#8211;K and EV6G&#8211;J). Together, these results demonstrate a direct physical and functional interaction between the C&#8208;terminal region of the MMS22L and RAD51.</text>

      <text>To determine whether MMS22L&#8211;TONSL directly promotes RAD51&#8208;dependent recombination, we employed in&#160;vitro DNA strand exchange assays (Fig&#160;6A). While ssDNA&#8208;bound RAD51 filaments are the active species capable to search and invade homologous DNA, RAD51 bound to dsDNA is inhibitory for recombination (Benson et&#160;al, 1994; Sigurdsson et&#160;al, 2001a). Reconstituted strand exchange reactions thus show a very narrow RAD51 concentration optimum. After RAD51 fully saturates ssDNA (~130&#160;nM, Fig&#160;6B), further increase in RAD51 concentration results in its binding to dsDNA, which inhibits DNA strand exchange (Benson et&#160;al, 1994). When supplemented with MMS22L&#8211;TONSL (75&#160;nM), the reaction optimum was reached at a similar RAD51 concentration (~130&#160;nM, Fig&#160;6C), but strikingly the inhibition at higher RAD51 concentrations was partially alleviated (Fig&#160;6C and D). A comparable behavior was observed in strand exchange reactions with both 3&#8242;&#8208; and 5&#8242;&#8208;tailed as well as gapped DNA (Fig&#160;EV7A&#8211;C), showing that the stimulatory effect of MMS22L&#8211;TONSL is not limited to a specific DNA structure and does not require a terminus, in keeping with the fork reversal model described above. All reactions were ATP dependent and required RAD51 (Fig&#160;EV7D and E), implying that MMS22L&#8211;TONSL is not capable of DNA strand exchange alone, but functions via promoting RAD51&#8208;dependent reactions (Sung, 1994). We then used a high RAD51 concentration (270&#160;nM) and titrated MMS22L&#8211;TONSL or MMS22L into the reactions. The heterodimer promoted strand exchange in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner showing saturation at ~50&#160;nM (Fig&#160;6E), while the MMS22L subunit alone was largely inactive (Figs&#160;6E and EV7F and G). The fact that both subunits of the MMS22L&#8211;TONSL complex are required for the stimulatory effect at high RAD51 concentrations (Fig&#160;6E), while MMS22L is sufficient for the interaction with RAD51 (Figs&#160;5D and EV6C), implies that the stimulatory effect of MMS22L&#8211;TONSL is not a simple result of chelating and reducing the free RAD51 pool. Together, these results demonstrate that MMS22L&#8211;TONSL promotes DNA strand exchange at high RAD51 concentrations.</text>

      <text>Our results presented in Fig&#160;6A&#8211;E infer that the heterodimer might affect RAD51&#8208;binding capacity to single&#8208; or double&#8208;stranded DNA. Specifically, MMS22L&#8211;TONSL might function similar to the BRCA2 tumor suppressor by reducing RAD51 affinity for dsDNA (Jensen et&#160;al, 2010; Liu et&#160;al, 2010; Thorslund et&#160;al, 2010). To directly test whether MMS22L&#8211;TONSL affects DNA&#8208;binding capacity of RAD51, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays with RAD51 and&#160;the MMS22L&#8211;TONSL heterodimer. Indeed, MMS22L&#8211;TONSL reduced RAD51 binding to dsDNA in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner, but had no effect on RAD51 binding to ssDNA (Figs&#160;6F and EV7H and I), which we also confirmed by DNA footprinting assays with DNaseI (data not shown). This activity was specific to the heterodimer, as the MMS22L subunit did not alter binding to either ssDNA or dsDNA (Fig&#160;EV7H and I). In contrast, MMS22L&#8211;TONSL was incapable to promote DNA strand exchange in the presence of RPA (Fig&#160;EV7J), which is another key capacity of BRCA2 and the RAD51 paralogues (Sigurdsson et&#160;al, 2001b; Jensen et&#160;al, 2010; Liu et&#160;al, 2010; Thorslund et&#160;al, 2010; Taylor et&#160;al, 2015). This shows that MMS22L&#8211;TONSL is incapable to relieve inhibition of DNA strand exchange imposed by RPA, and infers that it may function with additional partners. Finally, we used competition pulldown assays to test whether the reduction in RAD51&#8208;binding capacity to dsDNA might promote its affinity for ssDNA (Fig&#160;6G&#8211;I). As expected (Jensen et&#160;al, 2010), increasing the amount of dsDNA resulted in correspondingly less RAD51 bound to ssDNA (Fig&#160;6H). Conversely, titration of MMS22L&#8211;TONSL into reactions containing both ssDNA and dsDNA resulted in more RAD51 bound to ssDNA, an effect not observed with the MMS22L subunit (Fig&#160;6I). Finally, we observed that MMS22L&#8211;TONSL but not MMS22L was capable to bind an active RAD51 nucleoprotein filament in the presence of ATP (Fig&#160;EV7K). Under reaction conditions that are optimal for RAD51 filament formation, the binding of MMS22L&#8211;TONSL to ssDNA was stronger than binding to RPA&#8208;ssDNA (Fig&#160;EV7K and L). These results suggest that the capacity of MMS22L to bind RAD51 filaments might facilitate the retention of the heterodimer at DNA damage sites, consistent with the reduced DNA damage&#8208;dependent MMS22L foci in cells expressing the MMS22L FA variant incapable of interacting with RAD51 (Fig&#160;EV6F). Together, these results demonstrate that the MMS22L&#8211;TONSL heterodimer reduces the RAD51 capacity to bind dsDNA, which likely facilitates RAD51 assembly on stretches of ssDNA at perturbed replication forks, and thereby promotes HR&#8208;mediated events.</text>

      <text>The integrity and repair of stalled or collapsed replication forks is assured by homologous recombination through largely undefined mechanisms. Previous reports indicated that the human MMS22L&#8211;TONSL heterodimer plays a crucial role in this process. Here, we demonstrate that MMS22L&#8211;TONSL directly promotes DNA recombination upon replication stress. We show that MMS22L&#8211;TONSL is present at nascent DNA under unperturbed conditions, and MMS22L specifically interacts with RPA&#8208;coated ssDNA and the strand exchange protein RAD51. These interactions are required for the accumulation of MMS22L&#8211;TONSL at DNA damage sites during replication stress, as well as for efficient RAD51 foci formation upon DNA damage. Mechanistically, MMS22L&#8211;TONSL promotes replication fork reversal upon stalling at DNA damage sites, which helps to prevent replication fork collapse. Our data suggest that MMS22L&#8211;TONSL directly stimulates invasion of homologous DNA by limiting the capacity of RAD51 to interact with dsDNA. This activity promotes recombination leading to replication fork reversal, which permits fork restoration or repair (Fig&#160;7).</text>

Our results suggest that MMS22L&#8211;TONSL heterodimers control fork metabolism by reducing the capacity of RAD51 to bind dsDNA, which facilitates the formation of RAD51 filaments on stretches of ssDNA and initiates fork reversal. This prevents fork collapse and allows subsequent replication fork restoration.</text>

      <text>Why is MMS22L&#8211;TONSL particularly important for the repair of replication forks? A unique feature of MMS22L is its ability to preferentially bind RPA&#8208;coated ssDNA. This interaction may allow MMS22L&#8211;TONSL to dynamically associate with ssDNA produced by DNA unwinding during DNA replication or with extended ssDNA tracts that accumulate upon replication fork stalling. Indeed, in our iPOND experiments MMS22L&#8211;TONSL and RPA2 abundances correlate at replication forks (Fig&#160;3). The interaction with RPA&#8208;coated ssDNA also enables the enrichment of MMS22L at collapsed replication forks that had undergone extensive resection. In addition, TONSL has been shown to directly bind histones (Duro et&#160;al, 2010) and the specific interaction with histone H4 unmethylated at K20 contributes to the recruitment of the MMS22L&#8211;TONSL complex to newly replicated DNA, when a homologous template is available for repair (Saredi et&#160;al, 2016). This interaction could also facilitate the access of MMS22L&#8211;TONSL to post&#8208;replicative ssDNA gaps. Thus, the MMS22L&#8211;TONSL complex seems ideally equipped to participate in the repair of stalled and collapsed replication forks that accumulate stretches of ssDNA. Since the basal fork localization of the complex precedes the activation of the S&#8208;phase checkpoint, MMS22L&#8211;TONSL may be among the first factors helping to nucleate RAD51 filaments not only upon replication stress but also upon endogenous fork pausing conditions. In support of this, depletion of human MMS22L or TONSL, as well as the deletion of yeast MMS22 gene, leads to accumulation of spontaneous DNA breaks during unperturbed S phase (Luke et&#160;al, 2006; Duro et&#160;al, 2010; O'Connell et&#160;al, 2010; O'Donnell et&#160;al, 2010; Piwko et&#160;al, 2010). This is in agreement with our observations that MMS22L&#8211;TONSL promotes fork reversal (Fig&#160;4), which emerged as an important global response to replication stress and can occur in the absence of DNA breaks (Ray Chaudhuri et&#160;al, 2012; Neelsen &amp; Lopes, 2015; Zellweger et&#160;al, 2015). Given that MMS22L&#8208; or TONSL&#8208;depleted cells are hypersensitive to low nanomolar CPT treatments that induce robust fork reversal but not to ionizing radiation causing DSBs (Duro et&#160;al, 2010), it is tempting to speculate that promotion of RAD51&#8208;dependent fork reversal represents the essential activity of the MMS22L&#8211;TONSL complex. Interestingly, a recent study found that BRCA2&#8208;deficient cells still load RAD51 on nascent DNA on stressed replication forks, which is sufficient to promote sister chromatid exchange (Chaudhuri et&#160;al, 2016). This infers BRCA2&#8208;independent mechanisms to load RAD51 on DNA and promote recombination upon replication stress. It will be of particular interest to investigate the role of MMS22L&#8211;TONSL heterodimer under these conditions. Our data suggest that MMS22L&#8211;TONSL&#8208;facilitated nucleation of RAD51 on extended RPA&#8208;coated ssDNA prevents DSB formation by assisting fork reversal, but we cannot exclude that it may also function at a subset of forks that unavoidably collapsed, as MMS22L&#8211;TONSL&#8208;depleted cells are also impaired in homologous recombination reporter assays initiated by a dsDNA break (Duro et&#160;al, 2010; O'Connell et&#160;al, 2010; O'Donnell et&#160;al, 2010).</text>

      <text>How does MMS22L&#8211;TONSL promote recombination? We demonstrate that recombinant MMS22L directly binds the RAD51 recombinase, and provide evidence for a direct involvement of MMS22L&#8211;TONSL in promoting DNA strand exchange by RAD51 (Fig&#160;6). The activity of the complex favors interaction of RAD51 with ssDNA over dsDNA, therefore promoting the formation of RAD51&#8208;ssDNA presynaptic nucleoprotein filaments at high RAD51 concentrations. This process is a prerequisite for the invasion of homologous DNA and further steps in the HR pathway. MMS22L&#8211;TONSL thus acts as a regulator by a mechanism similar to human BRCA2 (Jensen et&#160;al, 2010). However, unlike BRCA2, MMS22L&#8211;TONSL cannot catalyze the assembly of RAD51 filaments on ssDNA coated with RPA, even though it is directly recruited to such substrates in&#160;vitro and in&#160;vivo. This suggests that MMS22L&#8211;TONSL does not regulate RAD51 on its own, but the process likely requires the interplay with additional factors. We hypothesize that the MMS22L&#8211;TONSL heterodimer might functionally interact with other recombination mediators such as the RAD51 paralogues in the efficient assembly of RAD51 filaments upon replication stress in&#160;vivo. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the yeast RAD51 paralogues Rad55&#8208;Rad57 protect Rad51&#8208;ssDNA filaments from disruption by the antirecombinase Srs2 (Liu et&#160;al, 2011), while the RAD51 paralogues RFS&#8208;1/RIP&#8208;1 from Cenorabditis elegans are able to directly remodel and stabilize open conformation of ssDNA&#8208;RAD&#8208;51 filaments (Taylor et&#160;al, 2015). Human RAD51 paralogues have functions that partially overlap with those of BRCA2 (Sigurdsson et&#160;al, 2001b). Our data establish that MMS22L&#8211;TONSL belongs to the growing group of factors that regulate recombination, but in contrast to the other mediators, its function seems highly specific to stalled or collapsed replication forks. Elucidating the precise relationship between the various recombination mediators and the MMS22L&#8211;TONSL complex at stalled replication forks represents an exciting future challenge.</text>

      <text>The strong connections between defects in HR and tumorigenesis suggest that mutations in the MMS22L and TONSL genes might be associated with cancer development. It has been demonstrated that defects in recombination mediators including BRCA2, RAD51B, and RAD51C frequently associate with breast and ovarian cancers (Wooster et&#160;al, 1995; Meindl et&#160;al, 2010; Golmard et&#160;al, 2013). Indeed, cancer genome sequencing projects identified several somatic mutations in the MMS22L and TONSL genes (Forbes et&#160;al, 2015), but at present none of these alterations has been confirmed as tumorigenic. Here, we demonstrate that the two point mutations in TONSL (E1089K D1104N) identified in a genome of an ovarian cancer patient could potentially be tumorigenic (Forbes et&#160;al, 2015), as they abolish the interaction with MMS22L and negatively influence the recruitment of RAD51 to distressed replication forks (Fig&#160;EV4). Moreover, we identified several additional cancer patient&#8208;derived point mutations in both MMS22L and TONSL that affect protein stability, suggesting that misregulation of the MMS22L&#8211;TONSL&#8208;dependent processes might be involved in promoting carcinogenesis. We therefore speculate that genome instability in some types of ovarian and possibly breast cancers might be promoted by MMS22L or TONSL mutations.</text>

      <text>U2OS (R. Aebersold, ETH Zurich) and HeLa (S. Taylor, University of Manchester) cell lines were grown in a humidified incubator at 37&#176;C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, PAA), 0.2&#160;mM L&#8208;glutamine, and standard antibiotics. The FRT&#8208;TetR&#8208;HeLa cell line (kindly provided by S. Taylor, University of Manchester) for creating stable cell lines using the Flp&#8208;In system (Invitrogen) was maintained as described previously (Tighe et&#160;al, 2008). For transient overexpression and stable cell line generation, DNA plasmid transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The stable HeLa cell line for doxycycline&#8208;inducible downregulation of MMS22L was obtained by transfection of FRT&#8208;TetR&#8208;HeLa cells with the shMMS22L&#8208;expressing vector based on pSUPERIOR.puro (OligoEngine) and maintained in the presence of 0.5&#160;&#956;g/ml puromycin (Gibco). The stable cell lines for doxycycline&#8208;inducible expression of HSS&#8208;tagged MMS22L and TONSL constructs were obtained by transfecting FRT&#8208;TetR U2OS or HeLa cell lines with the pcDNA5 (Invitrogen)&#8208;based constructs of the respective MMS22L/TONSL variants and maintained in the presence of 100&#160;&#956;g/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Stable cell lines for MMS22L expression were treated with 2.5&#160;mM sodium butyrate (Sigma) for 48&#160;h to revert silencing of the CMV promoter and subsequently maintained in the medium containing 10% tetracycline&#8208;free FBS (Bioconcept) to prevent resilencing of the integrated constructs. To induce expression in the FRT&#8208;TetR system, 1&#160;&#956;g/ml doxycycline (Sigma&#8208;Aldrich) was used. Thymidine block and release experiments were performed as described previously (Piwko et&#160;al, 2010). In brief, cells were synchronized at the G1/S transition by 16&#8208;h incubation in medium containing 2&#160;mM thymidine (Sigma&#8208;Aldrich), washed twice with pre&#8208;warmed DMEM, followed by incubation for 9&#160;h. Subsequently, thymidine was added and cells were incubated for another 16&#160;h. Next, cells were washed twice with DMEM and incubated for 2&#160;h to obtain S&#8208;phase cells and 11&#160;h to obtain M (including 5&#160;h of treatment with 0.23&#160;&#956;M nocodazole) and G1&#8208;synchronized cells. Subsequently, cells were treated with 5&#160;&#956;M etoposide for 3&#160;h prior to fixation.</text>

      <text>The procedure was essentially performed as previously described (Zellweger et&#160;al, 2015). Asynchronous subconfluent cultures of U2OS cells were treated with 25&#160;nM CPT for 1&#160;h. 4,5&#8242;,8&#8208;trimethylpsoralen (10&#160;&#956;g/ml final concentration) followed by irradiation pulses with UV 365&#8208;nm monochromatic light (UV Stratalinker 1800; Agilent Technologies) was used for in&#160;vivo psoralen cross&#8208;linking of DNA. For DNA extraction, the cells were first lysed with cell lysis buffer (buffer C1: 1.28&#160;M sucrose, 40&#160;mM Tris&#8211;HCl [pH 7.5], 20&#160;mM MgCl2, and 4% Triton X&#8208;100; Qiagen) and then digested in digestion buffer (Qiagen buffer G2: 800&#160;mM guanidine&#8211;HCl, 30&#160;mM Tris&#8211;HCl [pH 8.0], 30&#160;mM EDTA [pH 8.0], 5% Tween&#8208;20, and 0.5% Triton X&#8208;100) and 1&#160;mg/ml proteinase K at 50&#176;C for 2&#160;h. Chloroform/isoamylalcohol (24:1) was used to collect DNA via phase separation through centrifugation at 11,300&#160;g for 20&#160;min, followed by DNA precipitation by adding 0.7&#215; volume of isopropanol. About 70% EtOH was used to wash DNA. After air&#8208;drying, the DNA was resuspended in 200&#160;&#956;l TE (Tris&#8211;EDTA) buffer. 100&#160;U restriction enzyme (PvuII high fidelity, New England Biolabs) was used to digest 12&#160;&#956;g mammalian genomic DNA for 4&#8211;5&#160;h. Replication intermediates enrichment was performed by Poly&#8208;Prep chromatography columns. Benzoylated naphthoylated DEAE&#8211;cellulose granules were resuspended in 10&#160;mM Tris&#8211;HCl (pH 8.0) and 300&#160;mM NaCl to a final concentration of 0.1&#160;g/ml. The columns were washed and equilibrated with 10&#160;mM Tris&#8211;HCl (pH 8.0), followed by 1&#160;M NaCl and 10&#160;mM Tris&#8211;HCl (pH 8.0), and 300&#160;mM NaCl, respectively. DNA was then loaded and incubated for 30&#160;min. The columns were then washed with high NaCl solution (10&#160;mM Tris&#8211;HCl [pH 8.0] and 1&#160;M NaCl) and eluted in caffeine solution (10&#160;mM Tris&#8211;HCl [pH 8.0], 1&#160;M NaCl, and 1.8% [wt/vol] caffeine). To purify and concentrate the DNA, Amicon size&#8208;exclusion column was used. DNA was then resuspended in TE buffer. DNA was then spread by the &#8220;BAC method&#8221; and loaded on carbon&#8208;coated 400&#8208;mesh copper grids. We used a High Vacuum Evaporator MED 020 (BalTec) to coat DNA with platinum. Microscopy was performed with a transmission electron microscope (Tecnai G2 Spirit; FEI; LaB6 filament; high tension &#8804;&#160;120&#160;kV) and acquired with a side mount charge&#8208;coupled device camera (2,600&#160;&#215;&#160;4,000 pixels; Orius 1000; Gatan, Inc.). To perform statistics, at least 70 replication fork molecules were analyzed for each experimental condition. DigitalMicrograph version 1.83.842 (Gatan, Inc.) and ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) were used to process and analyze the images.</text>

      <text>Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the 6&#215; His&#8208;tagged amino&#8208;terminal fragment (1&#8211;325) of MMS22L were described previously (Piwko et&#160;al, 2010). Additional rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the carboxy&#8208;terminal peptide (GQMGQDEMQRLENDNT) of MMS22L (used in Figs&#160;EV5F and EV6I and J) were raised (Eurogentec, Belgium). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against TONSL were raised (Animal Facility, University of Zurich, Switzerland) and affinity&#8208;purified against a 6&#215; His&#8208;tagged fusion protein encoding amino acids 934&#8211;1,012 of TONSL. The following commercial antibodies were used: anti&#8208;RAD51 (H&#8208;92, Santa Cruz Biotech, 1:2,000), anti&#8208;PCNA (PC10, Santa Cruz Biotech, 1:5,000), anti&#8208;RPA2 (9H8, Imgenex, 1:2,000), anti&#8208;RPA2 pS33 (A300&#8211;246A, Bethyl Laboratories, 1:1,000), anti&#8208;RPA2 pS4/8 (A300&#8211;245A, Bethyl Laboratories, 1:1,000), anti&#8208;MCM4 (clone B01P, Abnova, 1:1,000), anti&#8208;&#945;&#8208;tubulin (DM1A, Sigma&#8208;Aldrich, 1:10,000), anti&#8208;HA.11 (16B12, Covance, 1:2,000), anti&#8208;ASF1A (C6E10, Cell Signaling, 1:5,000), anti&#8208;GAPDH (MAB374, Millipore, 1:5,000), and peroxidase&#8208;conjugated anti&#8208;mouse or anti&#8208;rabbit antibodies (Pierce, 1:5,000).</text>

      <text>The genes coding for MMS22L or TONSL were amplified from cDNA (Piwko et&#160;al, 2010) by PCR using primers hMMS22L&#8208;F (5&#8242;&#8208;GGCTAGCTGGGCCCGCTAGCGGATCCATGGAGAACTGTTCTGCT&#8208;3&#8242;) and hMMS22L&#8208;R (5&#8242;&#8208;CGCAAATCCTCGAGCCCGGGAGTATTATCATTTTCCAGTCTCT&#8208;3&#8242;) for MMS22L and hTONSL2&#8208;F (5&#8242;&#8208;GGCTAGCTGGGCCCGCTAGCGGATCCATGAGCCTGGAGCGCGAGCTTC&#8208;3&#8242;) and hTONSL&#8208;R (5&#8242;&#8208;CGCAAATCCTCGAGCCCGGGTCAGAGGCGCCGAAAGAAGAGC&#8208;3&#8242;) for TONSL. The PCR products of MMS22L were digested with ApaI and XhoI restriction endonucleases and cloned into ApaI and XhoI sites of pFB&#8208;MBP&#8208;Mlh3&#8208;his vector (Ranjha et&#160;al, 2014), generating pFB&#8208;MBP&#8208;MMS22L&#8208;his. The PCR products of TONSL were digested with NheI and XhoI sites into pFB&#8208;GST&#8208;Top3 vector (Cejka &amp; Kowalczykowski, 2010), generating pFB&#8208;GST&#8208;TONSL. The MMS22L&#8211;TONSL complex was expressed in Sf9 insect cells upon co&#8208;infection with MMS22L and TONSL baculoviruses according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Invitrogen). The proteins were extracted from Sf9 cell pellets with 325&#160;mM NaCl as described previously for Sgs1 (Cejka &amp; Kowalczykowski, 2010). The protein was then bound to amylose resin (New England Biolabs) via the MBP tag on the MMS22L subunit. Both MBP and GST tags were then cleaved off by PreScission protease. The GST&#8208;tag was not used in our final purification protocol due to low binding efficiency of the recombinant construct to glutathione sepharose resin. The final protein complex was obtained by affinity purification on NiNTA agarose (Qiagen) via a His&#8208;tag on the C&#8208;terminus of MMS22L. The NaCl concentration was kept at 200&#160;mM during the washing steps on both amylose and NiNTA resins to avoid disassembly of the complex. The MMS22L protein was prepared similarly, except 1&#160;M NaCl was used during the washing steps. The final sample was dialyzed against dialysis buffer containing 50&#160;mM Tris&#8211;HCl (pH 7.5), 5&#160;mM &#946;&#8208;mercaptoethanol, 100&#160;mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.5&#160;mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The MMS22L F1034A&#8208;TONSL heterodimer was expressed and purified as the wild&#8208;type heterodimer, but the yield of the variant was much lower.</text>

      <text>RAD51 was expressed from a pTXB3 vector (New England Biolabs) where it was fused to an intein tag at its C&#8208;terminus. Human RAD51 ORF was amplified by PCR from the plasmid pFB530 (Benson et&#160;al, 1994) using the following primers: 5&#8242;&#8208;GGGAATTCCATGGCAATGCAGATGCAGCTT&#8208;3&#8242; and 5&#8242;&#8208;AAGGCCGCTCTTCCGCAGTCTTTGGCATCTCCCACTCC&#8208;3&#8242;. The resulting PCR product was digested with NcoI and SapI and inserted in pTXB3 (New England Biolabs), creating a fusion of RAD51 with a self&#8208;cleavable affinity tag containing a chitin&#8208;binding domain. The fusion construct was expressed in E.&#160;coli BL21 cells and purified on chitin&#8208;binding resin (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The cleavage of the intein tag was carried out in a cleavage buffer containing 50&#160;mM Tris&#8211;HCl (pH 8.0), 500&#160;mM NaCl, 1&#160;mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 100&#160;mM dithiothreitol for 32&#160;h at 4&#176;C. The cleaved RAD51 was eluted with the same buffer without dithiothreitol, diluted with 50&#160;mM Tris&#8211;HCl (pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 200&#160;mM NaCl, and loaded onto pre&#8208;equilibrated HiTrap Q HP column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with R buffer containing 20&#160;mM Tris&#8211;HCl (pH 8.0), 1&#160;mM EDTA, 0.5&#160;mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol supplemented with 150&#160;mM NaCl. RAD51 was eluted with 10&#160;ml gradient of 150&#8211;700&#160;mM NaCl in R buffer supplemented with 1&#160;M NaCl. The final sample was dialyzed against dialysis buffer containing 20&#160;mM Tris&#8211;HCl (pH 8.0), 20% glycerol, 100&#160;mM NaCl, 1&#160;mM dithiothreitol. Human RPA was purified as described previously (Thangavel et&#160;al, 2015).</text>

      <text>The binding reactions with RPA and MMS22L&#8211;TONSL (or MMS22L) were carried out in a 15&#8208;&#956;l volume in 25&#160;mM Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 2&#160;mM magnesium acetate, 1&#160;mM dithiothreitol, 0.1&#160;mg/ml bovine serum albumin (New England Biolabs), 32P&#8208;labeled DNA substrate (1&#160;nM, ssDNA, 5&#8242;&#8208;tailed DNA, or 3&#8242;&#8208;tailed DNA), and recombinant proteins as indicated for 30&#160;min at 37&#176;C. Where indicated, RPA (8&#160;nM for ssDNA, 64&#160;nM for 3&#8242;&#8208; and 5&#8242;&#8208;tailed DNA) was pre&#8208;bound to the DNA on ice for 5&#160;min; subsequently, MMS22L&#8211;TONSL or MMS22L was added and the reaction was further incubated for 30&#160;min at 37&#176;C. 5&#160;&#956;l of loading dye containing 50% glycerol and 0.01% bromophenol blue was added and the reactions were separated at 4&#176;C on 6% polyacrylamide gels in TBE buffer (89.1&#160;mM Tris&#8211;base, 88.6&#160;mM boric acid, 2&#160;mM EDTA) or on 4% polyacrylamide gels in TBE buffer for reaction containing RPA at 4&#176;C. The gels were dried, exposed to a Phosphorimager screen (GE Healthcare), and analyzed by Typhoon FLA 9500 (GE Healthcare). The ssDNA was oligonucleotide X12&#8208;3, the 3&#8242;&#8208;tailed DNA was prepared by annealing oligonucleotides X12&#8208;3 SC and X12&#8208;4 NC, and the 5&#8242;&#8208;tailed DNA was prepared by annealing oligonucleotides X12&#8208;3 and X12&#8208;4 SC.

      <text>The binding assays (15&#160;&#956;l volume) with RAD51 and MMS22L&#8211;TONSL or MMS22L were performed similarly as described previously (Carreira et&#160;al, 2009). The binding buffer contained 20&#160;mM Tris&#8211;HCl (pH 7.5), 10&#160;mM magnesium acetate, 1&#160;mM dithiothreitol, 0.1&#160;mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2&#160;mM ATP, 2&#160;mM calcium chloride, DNA substrate, and recombinant proteins. For ssDNA reactions, we used unlabeled 3&#160;nM poly dA40 oligonucleotide and 1&#160;nM 32P&#8208;radiolabeled poly dA40. For dsDNA binding, the dA40 oligonucleotide was annealed with a complementary dT40. We used 29&#160;nM unlabeled poly dA40:dT40 and 1&#160;nM 32P&#8208;radiolabeled poly dA40:dT40 dsDNA. The concentration of RAD51 was 150&#160;nM in reactions with dsDNA and 640&#160;nM in reactions with ssDNA. The reaction products were analyzed as described above.</text>

      <text>Purified MMS22L&#8211;TONSL (with a MBP tag on the MMS22L subunit, 5.65&#160;&#956;g in a 150&#8208;&#956;l reaction volume) was mixed with a 5&#215; excess of recombinant RAD51 or RPA in a binding buffer containing 50&#160;mM Tris&#8211;HCl (pH 7.5), 2&#160;mM beta&#8208;mercaptoethanol, 50&#160;mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% NP&#8208;40. The reaction was mixed with 30&#160;&#956;l pre&#8208;equilibrated amylose resin (New England Biolabs) and incubated at room temperature for 30&#160;min with occasional stirring. The resin was then washed four times with 300&#160;&#956;l binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with 60&#160;&#956;l protein loading buffer (50&#160;mM Tris [pH 6.8], 10% glycerol, 1.6% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.1&#160;M dithiothreitol, 0.01% bromophenol blue) by boiling at 95&#176;C for 3&#160;min. The samples were analyzed on 10% SDS&#8211;PAGE and visualized by silver staining. Pulldowns with MMS22L (3.27&#160;&#956;g in a 210&#8208;&#956;l reaction volume) were carried out as above, except for the binding buffer also contained 10&#160;mM imidazole and NiNTA agarose (Qiagen) was used instead of amylose resin, exploiting the C&#8208;terminal His&#8208;tag on MMS22L. The resin was then washed four times with 450&#160;&#956;l binding buffer. Quantitative analysis of bound RAD51 was performed by a comparison with known amounts of the recombinant RAD51 or MMS22L&#8211;TONSL/MMS22L that were loaded on the same gel and used as protein standards, as described previously (Jensen et&#160;al, 2010).</text>

Then,&#160;MMS22L&#8211;TONSL and MMS22L (both 50&#160;nM) were added and incubated for further 15&#160;min at 37&#176;C. In reactions lacking RPA or MMS22L&#8211;TONSL/MMS22L, the reaction was mock&#8208;incubated under the same experimental conditions. Reaction mixture was subsequently mixed with 15&#160;&#956;l pre&#8208;equilibrated Streptavidin Dynabeads (Invitrogen, M&#8208;280) or NiNTA agarose (Qiagen) and incubated at 4&#176;C for 30&#160;min.

      <text>The assays (Fig&#160;6G&#8211;I) were performed essentially as described previously (Jensen et&#160;al, 2010) in a 20&#8208;&#956;l reaction volume. RAD51 (200&#160;nM) alone or with MMS22L&#8211;TONSL or MMS22L (20, 80, and 150&#160;nM) was pre&#8208;incubated at 37&#176;C for 15&#160;min in a binding buffer containing 20&#160;mM Tris&#8211;HCl (pH 7.5), 120&#160;mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X&#8208;100, 2&#160;mM calcium chloride, 10&#160;mM magnesium acetate, 2&#160;mM ATP, 1&#160;mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1&#160;mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Then, biotinylated B&#8208;90&#8208;mer (for sequence, see above; 1&#160;nM) was added with or without cold dsDNA (X12&#8208;3 annealed with X12&#8208;4 C (Cejka &amp; Kowalczykowski, 2010); 10&#160;nM) and incubated for 5&#160;min at 37&#176;C. Reactions were further incubated upon adding pre&#8208;equilibrated Streptavidin Dynabeads (15&#160;&#956;l, Invitrogen, M&#8208;280) at 4&#176;C for 30&#160;min while stirring occasionally.

The RAD51 protein bound to ssDNA was detected by Western blotting using a polyclonal anti&#8208;RAD51 antibody (Simandlova et&#160;al, 2013). The assays in Figs&#160;5E and F, and EV7K and L were performed as above with the following modifications. Biotinylated oligonucleotide B&#8208;90 (20&#160;nM) was premixed with RPA (100&#160;nM) in a 50&#8208;&#956;l volume in a reaction buffer as above and incubated for 10&#160;min at 37&#176;C. Then, MMS22L&#8211;TONSL, MMS22L FA&#8208;TONSL, MMS22L, or MMS22L FA (all proteins 50&#160;nM) was added either without or with RAD51 (500&#160;nM) and further incubated for 10&#160;min at 37&#176;C. Next, pre&#8208;equilibrated Streptavidin Dynabeads (5&#160;&#956;l) were added to the reaction and incubated at 4&#176;C for another 30&#160;min while stirring occasionally, washed, and eluted as above. Eluted proteins were detected by Western blotting with antibodies as indicated above or anti&#8208;FLAG (Sigma, F3165, 1:2,000).</text>

      <text>The reactions (15&#160;&#956;l) were performed essentially as described previously (Jensen et&#160;al, 2010). First, non&#8208;labeled DNA substrate (2.5&#160;nM, either ssDNA, 5&#8242;&#8208;tailed, 3&#8242;&#8208;tailed, or gapped DNA) was pre&#8208;incubated with the indicated amounts of RAD51 in a binding buffer containing 25&#160;mM Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 3&#160;mM magnesium acetate, 2&#160;mM calcium chloride, 0.1&#160;mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1&#160;mM ATP, and 1&#160;mM DTT for 5&#160;min at 37&#176;C. Subsequently, MMS22L&#8211;TONSL or MMS22L was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 5&#160;min at 37&#176;C. Next, 32P&#8208;radiolabeled dsDNA (2.5&#160;nM) was added and the reaction was further incubated for 30&#160;min at 37&#176;C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 5&#160;&#956;l STOP buffer (150&#160;mM EDTA, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 30% glycerol, 0.1% bromophenol blue) and 1&#160;&#956;l proteinase K (14&#8211;24&#160;mg/ml, Roche) for 10&#160;min at 37&#176;C. The reaction products were separated on 8% polyacrylamide gels in TBE buffer (89.1&#160;mM Tris&#8211;base, 88.6&#160;mM boric acid, 2&#160;mM EDTA). Where indicated, RPA was pre&#8208;bound to the DNA for 5&#160;min at 37&#176;C in the binding buffer containing 25&#160;mM Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 0.66&#160;mM magnesium acetate, 2&#160;mM calcium chloride, 0.1&#160;mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1&#160;mM ATP, and 1&#160;mM DTT; subsequently MMS22L&#8211;TONSL or MMS22L was added and incubated for 5&#160;min at 37&#176;C. Upon addition of 32P&#8208;radiolabeled dsDNA (2.5&#160;nM), the reaction was further incubated for 30&#160;min at 37&#176;C. The gel was dried and exposed to a Phosphorimager screen (GE Healthcare) and analyzed by Typhoon FLA 9500 (GE Healthcare). The ssDNA was oligonucleotide RJ&#8208;167&#8208;mer, the 3&#8242;&#8208;tailed DNA was prepared by annealing oligonucleotides RJ&#8208;167&#8208;mer and RJ&#8208;PHIX&#8208;42&#8208;1, the 5&#8242;&#8208;tailed DNA was prepared by annealing oligonucleotide RJ&#8208;5&#8242;TAIL&#8208;167&#8208;mer and RJ&#8208;PHIX&#8208;42&#8208;1, the gapped DNA was prepared by annealing oligonucleotide RJ&#8208;167&#8208;mer, RJ&#8208;PHIX&#8208;42&#8208;1, and RJ&#8208;END, and the dsDNA was prepared by annealing oligonucleotide RJ&#8208;Oligo1 and RJ&#8208;Oligo2. The sequences of oligonucleotides were described previously (Jensen et&#160;al, 2010), except RJ&#8208;END (5&#8242;&#8208;TAAATAAGATAAGGA&#8208;3&#8242;).</text>

      <text>For iPOND (Sirbu et&#160;al, 2011), HeLa cells were incubated in DMEM containing 10&#160;&#956;M EdU (Invitrogen) for 10&#160;min. For the CPT&#8208;recovery assay, EdU&#8208;labeled cells were first treated with 1&#160;&#956;M CPT for 30&#160;min, then washed three times with 10&#160;mM thymidine&#8208;containing medium, and incubated for indicated times. For the experiment in Fig&#160;3D and E, stably transfected HeLa cells with doxycycline&#8208;inducible shMMS22L were treated with doxycycline for 48&#160;h before performing CPT&#8208;recovery iPOND. For the experiment in Fig&#160;EV4B and C, endogenous TONSL was depleted by siRNA targeting 3&#8242;UTR for 24&#160;h and TONSL variants were expressed from a doxycycline&#8208;inducible promoter for additional 24&#160;h before the CPT&#8208;recovery assay. To cross&#8208;link proteins to DNA, cells were incubated in PBS containing 1% formaldehyde for 20&#160;min at room temperature. To quench excess of cross&#8208;linker, glycine was added to a final concentration of 125&#160;mM for 10&#160;min. Cells were washed three times with PBS and collected by centrifugation. For cell permeabilization, pellets were resuspended in PBS containing 0.25% Triton X&#8208;100 and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and incubated at 4&#176;C for 20&#160;min. Permeabilized cells were washed once with PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Roche). Cells were incubated in Click reaction buffer (PBS containing 10&#160;mM sodium ascorbate (Sigma&#8208;Aldrich), 10&#160;&#956;M Azide&#8208;PEG11&#8208;Biotin Conjugate (Tocris Bioscience), and 2&#160;&#956;M CuSO4) for 90&#160;min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and resuspended in lysis buffer (25&#160;mM Tris&#8211;HCl [pH 7.0], 150&#160;mM NaCl, 0.2% NP&#8208;40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, complete protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche). Suspension was sonicated on ice using Branson 250 sonifier and then centrifuged for 30&#160;min at 20,800&#160;g. Supernatants were collected, and Streptavidin MyOne T1 magnetic beads (Life Technologies) was added and incubated for 1&#160;h at 4&#176;C. Beads were washed twice with lysis buffer, once with 1&#160;M NaCl, and finally once with lysis buffer. Captured proteins were eluted by boiling for 30&#160;min at 95&#176;C and detected by Western blotting.</text>

      <text>DNA sequence encoding MMS22L was fused to the LexA DNA&#8208;binding domain by cloning into pLexA&#8208;N/C plasmids (Dualsystems, Switzerland); human MMS22L, RAD51, RAD51C, and RPA1 gene sequences were fused to the GAL4 activation domain in plasmid pGAD&#8208;HA (Dualsystems, Switzerland). Yeast strain L40 was transformed with each plasmid and plated onto SD&#8211;Leu&#8211;Trp medium and incubated at 30&#176;C. For RPA1&#8208;binding assays, myc&#8208;RPA2 and flag&#8208;RPA3 were cloned into YIpDCE1 plasmid (Stearman et&#160;al, 1998), subsequently integrated in L40 to allow co&#8208;expression of all RPA subunits. For survival assays, equal numbers of cells were spotted on SD&#8211;Leu&#8211;Trp control plates and SD&#8211;Leu&#8211;Trp&#8211;His plates containing 20&#160;mM 3&#8208;aminotriazole (3&#8208;AT; Sigma) and incubated at 30&#176;C for 3&#160;days. For monitoring &#946;&#8208;galactosidase expression, pellets of yeast cells grown in SD&#8211;Leu&#8211;Trp medium corresponding to OD600&#160;=&#160;1.5 was washed with 1&#215; PBS, resuspended in 100&#160;&#956;l X&#8208;Gal reagent (0.1% (w/v) X&#8208;Gal (Sigma&#8208;Aldrich), 0.05% (v/v) &#946;&#8208;mercaptoethanol, 0.1% (w/v) SDS in 1&#215; PBS) and transferred to 96&#8208;well plate. Suspensions were incubated at room temperature until the reaction color developed and scanned.</text>
