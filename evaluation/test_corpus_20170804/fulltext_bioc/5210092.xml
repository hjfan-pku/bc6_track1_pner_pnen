      <text>Coenzyme Q (CoQ) is an electron acceptor for sulfide&#8208;quinone reductase (SQR), the first enzyme of the hydrogen sulfide oxidation pathway. Here, we show that lack of CoQ in human skin fibroblasts causes impairment of hydrogen sulfide oxidation, proportional to the residual levels of CoQ. Biochemical and molecular abnormalities are rescued by CoQ supplementation in&#160;vitro and recapitulated by pharmacological inhibition of CoQ biosynthesis in skin fibroblasts and ADCK3 depletion in HeLa cells. Kidneys of Pdss2 kd/kd mice, which only have ~15% residual CoQ concentrations and are clinically affected, showed (i) reduced protein levels of SQR and downstream enzymes, (ii) accumulation of hydrogen sulfides, and (iii) glutathione depletion. These abnormalities were not present in brain, which maintains ~30% residual CoQ and is clinically unaffected. In Pdss2 kd/kd mice, we also observed low levels of plasma and urine thiosulfate and increased blood C4&#8208;C6 acylcarnitines. We propose that impairment of the sulfide oxidation pathway induced by decreased levels of CoQ causes accumulation of sulfides and consequent inhibition of short&#8208;chain acyl&#8208;CoA dehydrogenase and glutathione depletion, which contributes to increased oxidative stress and kidney failure.</text>

      <text>Coenzyme Q (CoQ), or ubiquinone, is a lipid antioxidant and electron carrier, present in all cell membranes, and involved in many biological processes (Bentinger et&#160;al, 2010). Mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in CoQ biosynthesis cause primary CoQ deficiency, an autosomal recessive mitochondrial disorder associated with five major clinical phenotypes: (i) encephalomyopathy, (ii) severe infantile multi&#8208;systemic disease, (iii) cerebellar ataxia, (iv) isolated myopathy, and (v) steroid&#8208;resistant nephrotic syndrome (Desbats et&#160;al, 2015). This heterogeneity in the clinical presentation suggests that multiple pathomechanisms may exist. Because of its essential function as electron carrier from mitochondrial complexes I and II to complex III as well as an endogenous antioxidant, the effects of CoQ deficiency on mitochondrial bioenergetics and oxidative stress have been assessed in&#160;vitro (Lopez et&#160;al, 2014) and in&#160;vivo (Licitra &amp; Puccio, 2014). Increased oxidative stress and ATP depletion have been described as initial events promoting mitochondrial&#8208;mediated apoptotic cell death (Lopez et&#160;al, 2014) and/or autophagy (Rodriguez&#8208;Hernandez et&#160;al, 2009).</text>

      <text>CoQ&#8208;deficient fission yeast have been shown to produce high sulfide levels (Zhang et&#160;al, 2008), and more recently, proteomics studies revealed decreased protein levels of SQR in CoQ&#8208;deficient mice carrying a missense mutation in COQ9, a protein involved in the biosynthesis of CoQ through regulation of the levels of the hydroxylase COQ7 (Lohman et&#160;al, 2014; Luna&#8208;S&#225;nchez et&#160;al, 2015). However, whether the H2S metabolism is impaired in CoQ deficiency, and whether H2S metabolism impairment has a role in the pathogenesis or the progression of this disorder, has not yet been investigated.</text>

      <text>Sulfide (H2S) is a gas modulator (like nitric oxide and carbon monoxide) produced endogenously via the cysteine catabolism by&#160;the cytoplasmic enzymes cystathionine&#8208;&#946;&#8208;synthase (CBS), cystathionine&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lyase (CSE, CTH), and 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate by 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST). CBS is predominantly active in the nervous system, kidney, and liver; CSE in liver, intestine, smooth muscle, and pancreas (Stipanuk &amp; Beck, 1982; Hosoki et&#160;al, 1997; Zhao et&#160;al, 2001; Enokido et&#160;al, 2005; Tiranti &amp; Zeviani, 2013; Gao et&#160;al, 2015), and 3&#8208;MST, a mitochondrial and cytoplasmic enzyme, is active mainly in the nervous system (in particular cerebellum), kidney, and vascular endothelium, where it exerts an important cytoprotective role (Steegborn et&#160;al, 1999; Shibuya et&#160;al, 2009, 2013).</text>

      <text>H2S physiologically modifies cysteine residues in numerous proteins by S&#8208;sulfhydration, affecting their functions (Mustafa et&#160;al, 2009), and it is involved in several physiological functions such as neural development, angiogenesis, cardioprotection, prevention of oxidative stress, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (Bouillaud &amp; Blachier, 2011). However, if accumulated in the order of micromolar concentrations, it becomes toxic through interaction with heme&#8208;containing proteins, causing severe cytochrome c oxidase (COX, complex IV) deficiency, through rapid heme a inhibition that maintains the complex in a constant reduced state and accelerates long&#8208;term degradation of COX subunits (Di Meo et&#160;al, 2011). In addition, sulfide inhibits the enzymatic activity of short&#8208;chain acyl&#8208;CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD), causing dicarboxylic aciduria (Pedersen et&#160;al, 2003), and is implicated in vasorelaxation by opening ATP&#8208;sensitive K+ channels in vascular smooth muscle (Yang et&#160;al, 2008), inflammation (Yang et&#160;al, 2013), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Eghbal et&#160;al, 2004).</text>

      <text>H2S is catabolized in the mitochondria by the cooperation of at least four proteins, which sequentially perform the oxidation of the sulfide into a sulfate ion (Fig&#160;1). In the first step of sulfide catabolism, sulfide&#8208;quinone reductase (SQR), an enzyme bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane, which belongs to the family of flavoprotein disulfide oxidoreductases, transfers sulfane sulfur atoms from the toxic sulfides to free sulfites, generating thiosulfate. During this reaction, electrons are shuttled from sulfide to the mitochondrial electron transport chain by reduction of ubiquinone (CoQ) to ubiquinol (Jackson et&#160;al, 2012). The product of this reaction, thiosulfate, is then oxidized in the mitochondrial matrix by a sulfurtransferase (TST, Rodhanese). TST mediates the conversion of thiosulfate to sulfite, transferring sulfane sulfur to a &#8211;SH&#8208;containing acceptor, like glutathione (GSH). The sulfur dioxygenase ethylmalonic encephalopathy protein 1 (ETHE1 or persulfide dioxygenase), a mitochondrial matrix protein, participates in the conversion of thiosulfate to sulfite. The terminal component of this known pathway is the sulfide oxidase SUOX, which oxidizes sulfite to sulfate, which is subsequently secreted into the blood and eliminated through the urine (Muller et&#160;al, 2004; Hildebrandt &amp; Grieshaber, 2008).</text>

      <text>SQR converts sulfide into thiosulfate by transferring two electrons from the H2S oxidation to ubiquinone (CoQ). Thiosulfate is then converted into sulfite by TST and ETHE1; this reaction requires a sulfur acceptor (glutathione, GSH). Excess of sulfite is converted into sulfate by SUOX.</text>

      <text>So far, molecular defects in ETHE1 and SUOX, responsible for autosomal recessive ethylmalonic encephalopathy (EE) and sulfite oxidase deficiency (or sulfocysteinuria), respectively, and the rare molybdenum cofactor deficiency, are the only cause of sulfide metabolism impairment associated with human diseases (Johnson et&#160;al, 2002; Tiranti et&#160;al, 2009).</text>

      <text>Here, we show that in human fibroblasts, mutations in CoQ biosynthetic genes reduce SQR levels and biochemical activity proportionally to CoQ levels, followed by compensatory up&#8208;regulation of enzymes of the downstream pathway. Biochemical and molecular abnormalities are partially reverted by CoQ supplementation in&#160;vitro and recapitulated by pharmacologic inhibition of CoQ biosynthesis in wild&#8208;type skin fibroblasts and by depletion in HeLa cells of ADCK3, an atypical protein kinase involved in CoQ biosynthesis regulation (Stefely et&#160;al, 2015). In contrast, in kidneys, the only affected organ of Pdss2 kd/kd mice, a mouse model of CoQ deficiency, severely reduced SQR levels are associated with down&#8208;regulation of all the downstream enzymes of the pathway, GSH depletion, and reduction of thiosulfates. Furthermore, accumulation of H2S in Pdss2 kd/kd mice causes short&#8208;chain CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) inhibition, as shown by increased blood levels of C4&#8208;C6 acylcarnitines. The shutdown of the H2S oxidation pathway observed in kidneys of Pdss2 kd/kd mice was reproduced by severe knockdown of SQR in HeLa cells. Taken together, these findings demonstrate multiple downstream effects of CoQ deficiency on sulfide metabolism.</text>

      <text>To evaluate the possible relationship between CoQ10 deficiency and impairment of the hydrogen sulfide oxidation pathway, we measured CoQ10 levels in human skin fibroblasts from patients carrying molecular defects in different genes encoding proteins involved in the CoQ biosynthesis (COQ genes; Table&#160;1 and Fig&#160;2). Patient skin fibroblasts showed variable levels of CoQ10 deficiency ranging from 52 to 54% of normal (P1 and P5) to 28.9% (P2), and 18 and 13.4% (P3 and P4), confirming previous published findings in the same cell lines (Table&#160;1). Intermediates of CoQ10 biosynthesis were not detected in the chromatograms of any of the patients.</text>

      <text>In order to assess sulfide oxidation in primary human CoQ10 deficiencies, we evaluated oxygen consumption in the presence of NaHS, a hydrogen sulfide donor, in permeabilized human fibroblasts from patients with CoQ10 deficiency (P1&#8211;P5). Complex I inhibitor rotenone and the uncoupler FCCP were used to inhibit endogenous respiration and to ensure a maximal oxidation rate, respectively. Infusion of 60&#160;&#956;M NaHS allowed oxygen consumption by permeabilized cells, through the SQR&#8208;CoQ10 system, which was blocked by antimycin, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III. Figure&#160;3A (solid lines) shows representative experiments of SQR&#8208;driven respiration for each cell line. In contrast, the complex IV&#8208;driven oxygen consumption rate was evaluated under the same conditions using TMPD/ascorbate, instead of NaHS, as substrates (Appendix&#160;Fig S2). The maximal respiration rate of complex IV was used to normalize sulfide oxidation values. As expected, while complex IV&#8208;driven oxygen consumption was comparable in all the tested cell lines (Appendix&#160;Fig S2), CoQ10 depletion caused a significant impairment of SQR&#8208;driven respiration in comparison with control fibroblasts, which correlated well with the residual amount of CoQ10 (Table&#160;1). Fibroblasts from patients P2, P3, and P4 with a residual CoQ concentration below 30% showed a larger decrease in sulfide oxidation, while fibroblasts from patients P1 and P5 with a residual CoQ concentration of ~50% only showed a partial decrease in SQR&#8208;driven respiration (Fig&#160;3A and B). Interestingly, after an initial linear decline, we observed a progressive decrease in SQR&#8208;driven oxygen consumption in patient&#8208;derived cells. This phenomenon could be explained by the reduced ability of CoQ&#8208;deficient fibroblasts to oxidize sulfide, which subsequently accumulates in the reaction media and gradually inhibits complex IV activity.</text>

      <text>To assess whether exogenous CoQ10 can restore the ability of CoQ10&#8208;deficient fibroblasts to oxidize sulfide, fibroblasts of patients P3, P4, and P5 were cultured 1&#160;week in the presence of 5&#160;&#956;M of CoQ10, before Oxygraph&#174; analysis was performed (Fig&#160;3A, dashed lines). While control cells did not show a significant increase in sulfide oxidation rate, COQ&#8208;mutant fibroblasts showed a significant increase in SQR&#8208;driven respiration (Fig&#160;3B). These data confirm that CoQ10 is the electron acceptor essential for SQR activity and that human primary CoQ10 deficiency causes impairment of sulfide oxidation.</text>

      <text>To investigate the consequences of reduced SQR activity/protein levels on the other mitochondrial enzymes of the H2S oxidation pathway, we measured protein levels of TST, ETHE1, and SUOX and found them to be increased in fibroblasts from patients P1&#8211;P4 (TST: 188&#8211;489% of controls; SUOX: 159&#8211;355% of controls; and ETHE1: 255% of controls in P4; for TST: P&#160;=&#160;0.16, P&#160;=&#160;0.0115, P&#160;=&#160;0.097, P&#160;=&#160;0.0115; for SUOX: P&#160;=&#160;0.014, P&#160;=&#160;0.007, P&#160;=&#160;0.007, P&#160;=&#160;0.007; for ETHE1: P&#160;=&#160;0.37, P&#160;=&#160;0.076, P&#160;=&#160;0.83, P&#160;=&#160;0.002; Fig&#160;4C&#8211;E).</text>

      <text>To assess whether exogenous CoQ10 was able to restore SQR protein levels, we cultured the two cell lines with lower CoQ10 and SQR levels (P3, with 49% of residual SQR, P&#160;=&#160;0.006, and P4, with 39% residual SQR, P&#160;=&#160;0.006) with 5&#160;&#956;M of CoQ10 for 1&#160;week. We observed that CoQ10 supplementation completely restored SQR protein levels in P3 patient cell line (102% of controls, P&#160;=&#160;1) and partially increased SQR protein levels in P4 (56% of controls, P&#160;=&#160;0.093; Fig&#160;5A and B). The other enzymes of the H2S oxidation pathway were unchanged by CoQ10 supplementation (Fig&#160;5A and C&#8211;E). In summary, these data show that severe CoQ10 deficiency is&#160;associated with proportional reduction in SQR, and increased levels of the enzymes of the downstream pathway. CoQ10 supplementation increases the levels of SQR, without normalizing the levels of the enzymes of the downstream pathway, suggesting that these depend on SQR levels, rather than CoQ10 levels.</text>

      <text>To assess whether the molecular abnormalities in the H2S oxidation pathway observed in patient fibroblasts were caused by CoQ10 deficiency independently from the primary molecular defects, we used two approaches: (i) We pharmacologically inhibited CoQ10 biosynthesis in wild&#8208;type skin fibroblasts with 4&#8208;nitrobenzoate (4&#8208;NB), an analogue of 4&#8208;hydroxybenzoate (4HB) that specifically inhibits the activity of COQ2 and causes CoQ10 deficiency (Forsman et&#160;al, 2010; Quinzii et&#160;al, 2012), and (ii) we knocked down ADCK3 in HeLa cells. ADCK3 is an atypical protein kinase, whose mutations cause CoQ10 deficiency in humans and whose yeast homologue has been shown to regulate CoQ biosynthesis (Acosta et&#160;al, 2016).</text>

These data indicate that (i) SQR may be degraded only in the presence of severe and constitutive CoQ10 depletion, which was not the case in 4&#8208;NB&#8208;treated fibroblasts, and (ii) transcriptional activation of SQR might compensate for the lack of protein activity and stability.</text>

To prove that H2S oxidation impairment and consequent H2S accumulation caused by CoQ deficiency increases the levels of protein S&#8208;sulfhydration, we assessed H2S&#8208;mediated protein sulfhydration in P1 (~50% residual CoQ; normal SQR protein levels) and P4 (~15% residual CoQ; ~26% SQR protein). As expected, we found increased protein sulfhydration in patient cell lines compared with controls (Fig&#160;7; Appendix Table&#160;S1); however, there was no difference in the magnitudes of the increases in the two patient cell lines (1.61&#8208; and 1.49&#8208;fold increase, respectively, compared with controls; Fig&#160;7; Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S1), indicating that in P1, although SQR protein levels are normal, the partial lack of CoQ is enough to reduce SQR activity, as shown by the experiment of SQR&#8208;driven respiration.</text>

      <text>To assess the relationship between CoQ levels and sulfide metabolism in&#160;vivo, we measured mRNA and protein levels of the enzymes involved in H2S oxidation pathway in kidney and brain of Pdss2 kd/kd mice, which carry a homozygous mutation in Pdss2, a subunit of the first enzyme of CoQ biosynthesis (Peng et&#160;al, 2004). We previously demonstrated that kidney, the only clinically affected organ of these animals, had 14% residual CoQ9 (the form of CoQ more abundant in mice) concentrations, while brain, which was clinically unaffected, had 30% residual CoQ9 concentrations (Quinzii et&#160;al, 2013). Consistent with our observation in mutant fibroblasts, SQR protein levels were severely reduced in kidneys of mutant (16% of controls; P&#160;=&#160;0.0001) as compared with control animals (Fig&#160;8A). In contrast to our observations in fibroblasts, which had increased TST, ETHE1, and SUOX protein levels, but consistent with the results in SQR&#8208;depleted cells, these proteins were all significantly decreased in the kidney tissue of Pdss2 kd/kd mice (30, 34 and 45% of controls, respectively; P&#160;=&#160;0.0001, P&#160;=&#160;0.003, and P&#160;=&#160;0.003) as compared with wild&#8208;type mice (Fig&#160;8B&#8211;D).</text>

We found that the amount of thiosulfate was significantly reduced in the urine (21% of controls; P&#160;=&#160;0.02), and mildly, although not significantly reduced in plasma (60% of controls) of Pdss2 kd/kd as compared with wild&#8208;type mice (Fig&#160;10C and D).</text>

      <text>Here, we have addressed the role of an impairment of H2S oxidation in the pathogenesis of CoQ deficiency. We demonstrated that CoQ&#8208;deficient fibroblasts carrying mutations in different COQ genes have decreased SQR&#8208;driven respiration, which is associated with variably reduced SQR steady&#8208;state levels, depending on the severity of CoQ deficiency, and subsequent compensatory up&#8208;regulation of the levels of the downstream proteins of the pathway. We hypothesize that if the levels of CoQ are very low, SQR activity is decreased and SQR becomes unstable and is probably degraded. Partial reduction in SQR and/or its activity leads to up&#8208;regulation of the enzymes of the downstream pathway (TST, ETHE1, and SUOX), which is more evident at the translational than at transcriptional level. The molecular abnormalities observed in COQ&#8208;mutant fibroblasts are due to reduced CoQ levels, because they can be rescued by CoQ supplementation and are partially recapitulated by pharmacological inhibition of CoQ biosynthesis via 4&#8208;NB in wild&#8208;type fibroblasts and by ADCK3 depletion in HeLa cells. 4&#8208;NB is an analogue of 4&#8208;HB and inhibitor of 4&#8208;para&#8208;hydroxybenzoate:polyprenyl transferase (COQ2; Forsman et&#160;al, 2010). We previously showed that 4&#8208;NB at a concentration of 4&#160;mM causes a CoQ deficiency of ~40% and consequent reduced ATP and ATP/ADP levels, increased ROS and oxidative stress resulting in cell death (Quinzii et&#160;al, 2012). Here, we found that the same dose of 4&#8208;NB is associated with normal levels of SQR protein. We hypothesize that the decrease in CoQ levels is not severe enough to cause protein instability, or that in fibroblasts SQR is degraded only if CoQ deficiency is chronic, and that the limited timeframe of pharmacologic inhibition of CoQ biosynthesis might decrease SQR activity, but not its protein levels. Consistent with the first possibility is our observation that COQ&#8208;mutant fibroblasts with more severe CoQ deficiency (P3 and P4) have the lowest levels of SQR. P2 and fibroblasts treated with 4&#8208;NB show transcriptional up&#8208;regulation of SQR mRNA, not evident in the other cell lines. We cannot explain why the response of the H2S oxidation pathway to CoQ deficiency differs among patient cell lines at transcriptional levels. However, the effect of CoQ synthesis inhibition on SQR mRNA levels was striking, suggesting that changes in CoQ levels modulate gene expression, possibly through this antioxidant function. Indeed, a role of CoQ in several biological processes, such as lipid metabolism, inflammation, and cell signaling through regulation of genes expression, has been previously proposed (Schmelzer et&#160;al, 2008; Fischer et&#160;al, 2016). The level of the enzymes of the pathway downstream SQR appears to be regulated by SQR activity and/or level: Partial SQR depletion as observed in patient fibroblasts, 4&#8208;NB&#8208;treated wild&#8208;type fibroblasts, and ADCK3&#8208;depleted HeLa cells causes up&#8208;regulation of the other enzymes, while severe SQR depletion shuts down the pathway, suggesting a mechanism of regulation of the pathway downstream SQR possibly dependent on the availability of catabolites generated by SQR activity. Although our data suggest a tight regulation at both transcriptional and translational level, this regulatory mechanism needs further investigation.</text>

      <text>As a consequence of sulfide accumulation, COQ&#8208;mutant fibroblasts have increased protein S&#8208;sulfhydration. Although we observed a correlation between degree of CoQ deficiency and SQR&#8208;driven respiration defect, these changes were not correlated with the magnitude of protein sulfhydration increase. This may be due to (i) experimental conditions, since SQR&#8208;driven respiration is measured adding excess of NaHS as substrate, while protein sulfhydration was measured under physiological conditions, or (ii) presence of other compensatory mechanisms regulating H2S levels, for example, effect on the upstream H2S biosynthesis pathway, depending on CoQ levels or genetic background of the fibroblasts. Regardless, CoQ deficiency clearly causes disregulation of an important post&#8208;translational modification, which may affect multiple physiological processes (Mustafa et&#160;al, 2009; Paul &amp; Snyder, 2012).</text>

      <text>Interestingly, we found normal levels of SQR and an increase in protein levels for TST, ETHE1, and SUOX in brain of Pdss2 kd/kd mice, which harbor a spontaneous mutation in the gene encoding the subunit 2 of polyprenyl&#8208;diphosphate synthase (Pdss2), the first enzyme of the CoQ biosynthetic pathway. Homozygous Pdss2 kd/kd mice are apparently healthy for the first 8&#160;weeks of life, but from 12&#160;weeks of age onward, histological analysis of the kidney (which has only 15% residual CoQ) reveals a mononuclear cell infiltrate and tubular dilatation. Adult Pdss2 kd/kd mice develop a typical nephrotic syndrome, leading to kidney failure (Peng et&#160;al, 2004; Madaio et&#160;al, 2005). In brain, which has ~30% residual CoQ concentrations and does not show any clinical phenotype, SQR was detectable only in mutant mice, and the downstream H2S oxidation pathway was normal. It is noteworthy that we detected SQR in brain of mutant and not wild&#8208;type animals, since although SQR mRNA has been reported to be present in brain, the presence of SQR protein in brain is still under debate (Ackermann et&#160;al, 2011; Linden et&#160;al, 2012). In contrast, in kidney of Pdss2 kd/kd mice, we did not find an up&#8208;regulation of the sulfide oxidation pathway, but rather decreases in all the enzymes of the pathway. Moreover, we observed reduced GSH in kidney and very low levels of thiosulfate in the urine of Pdss2 kd/kd mice, suggesting a shutdown of the oxidation pathway, as observed in SQR&#8208;depleted HeLa cells cultured for 48&#160;h.</text>

      <text>As a consequence of the shutdown of the H2S catabolic pathway, we observed a mild accumulation of H2S in mutant mice kidney compared with controls. This quantification may be inaccurate, because H2S is extremely volatile and therefore difficult to measure in tissues (Vitvitsky et&#160;al, 2012). The only moderate increase in H2S concentrations we observed may explain the absence of COX deficiency in the affected tissues of the Pdss2 kd/kd mice (Quinzii et&#160;al, 2012). Although COX inhibition is considered the primary mechanism of H2S toxicity (Nicholls &amp; Kim, 1982), it is possible that in CoQ deficiency, where SQR activity is reduced but not completely absent, H2S levels are not high enough to suppress COX activity in contrast to ethylmalonic aciduria, which presents with a much more severe phenotype and COX deficiency in patients (Tiranti et&#160;al, 2009). Furthermore, it is important to note that the ethylmalonic aciduria mouse model shows normal COX activity and level in kidney and liver, in spite of high thiosulfate and H2S concentrations. This may reflect the presence of tissue&#8208;specific alternative metabolic pathways for H2S detoxification, or different buffering mechanisms (Tiranti et&#160;al, 2009). Nevertheless, other mechanisms of H2S toxicity, including inhibition of short&#8208;chain fatty acid oxidation, GSH depletion (Truong et&#160;al, 2006), and the ability of H2S to generate ROS (Bouillaud &amp; Blachier, 2011), may play a role in the pathogenesis of CoQ deficiency and EE&#8208;deficient mice. We previously demonstrated increased ROS production and oxidative stress in kidney tissue of Pdss2 kd/kd mice (Quinzii et&#160;al, 2013). The role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of CoQ deficiency is supported by the observation of CoQ deficiency and oxidative stress in the brain of Coq9&#8208;mutant mice (Garcia&#8208;Corzo et&#160;al, 2013). Moreover, in COQ&#8208;mutant fibroblasts, and in wild&#8208;type fibroblasts treated with 4&#8208;NB, we showed that reduced cell viability correlated with increased ROS production and oxidative stress (Lopez et&#160;al, 2010; Quinzii et&#160;al, 2010, 2012). We also observed in one COQ&#8208;mutant cell line (P2 in this work) a trend toward a decrease in total GSH content accompanied by a slight decrease in the activities of the glutathione enzymes GPx and GRd (Quinzii et&#160;al, 2008). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that tissue&#8208;specific abnormalities of H2S metabolism may contribute to oxidative stress in CoQ deficiency through alteration of the glutathione system. For example, H2S autoxidation could produce reactive sulfur and oxygen radical causing GSH depletion (Truong et&#160;al, 2006), or synthesis of GSH could be down&#8208;regulated to balance the increase in GSH caused by decrease in TST. However, the causes of GSH reduction can be independent of H2S oxidation impairment. Since CoQ is an antioxidant, both via direct prevention of lipid peroxidation and indirect regeneration of other antioxidants such as vitamins C and E, as well as an electron carrier in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, lack of CoQ may cause an increase in ROS production and oxidative stress because antioxidant defenses are reduced and electron transport in the respiratory chain is impaired. Therefore, chronic oxidative stress due to the lack of CoQ could be responsible for depletion of antioxidant defenses, including GSH. Importantly, Luna&#8208;S&#225;nchez et&#160;al (2017) showed reduced GSH levels in brain of Coq9&#8208;mutant mice. However, they also observed that SQR&#8208;depleted cells have GSH levels comparable to controls, supporting the hypothesis that reduction of GSH is independent of SQR levels, or is a tissue&#8208; or cell&#8208;specific effect of low SQR (Luna&#8208;S&#225;nchez et&#160;al, 2017).</text>

      <text>We cannot discern between the single factors in the overall increase in oxidative stress in states of CoQ deficiency. ROS have been shown to have a role in the pathogenesis of nephrotic syndrome (Greenbaum et&#160;al, 2012; Emma et&#160;al, 2016); however, the relationship between oxidative stress and hydrogen sulfides in renal pathology is controversial. Although most of the literature supports the notion that hydrogen sulfide protects against oxidative stress and thus generally also against renal disease (Koning et&#160;al, 2015; Lobb et&#160;al, 2015), some recent studies suggest that treatment with the CSE inhibitor propargylglycine (PAG) inhibits endogenous H2S production and increases antioxidant enzyme expression while significantly improving renal function reducing renal damage, fibrosis, and inflammation. Another study demonstrated that PAG&#8208;treated animals exhibited significantly improved renal function and decreased renal necrosis as well as decreased ROS production, oxidative stress, and caspase activation following gentamicin treatment (Francescato et&#160;al, 2012).</text>

      <text>We postulate that the discrepancy in levels of SQR between human fibroblasts and mouse kidney is mostly tissue related. Tissue specificity is typical of human and murine mitochondrial disorders, and fibroblasts are not clinically affected. We previously observed that Pdss2&#8208;mutant fibroblasts do not show the detrimental effects of CoQ deficiency observed in Pdss2&#8208;mutant mice kidney. The molecular and biochemical abnormalities observed in patient fibroblasts reflect more severe abnormalities or a selective vulnerability to the effects of CoQ deficiency of the kidney, which is often clinically affected in CoQ deficiency, independently of the molecular defect.</text>

      <text>In conclusion, we demonstrate that impairment of hydrogen sulfide oxidation may play a synergistic role with CoQ deficiency in the pathogenesis of nephrotic syndrome, one of the most common phenotypes of human CoQ deficiency through generation of additional oxidative stress. Our results provide insight into a novel disease mechanism and into the unresolved mechanisms responsible for the efficacy of CoQ10 treatment in nephrotic syndrome (Saiki et&#160;al, 2008; Emma et&#160;al, 2016).</text>

      <text>Furthermore, we describe for the first time a defect of fatty acid oxidation to be associated with primary CoQ deficiency. This observation deserves further confirmation in human patients, because it might explain some of the clinical features present in CoQ deficiency with a severe early&#8208;onset multi&#8208;organ phenotype, and has clear therapeutic implications.</text>

      <text>To measure the steady&#8208;state protein levels of the enzymes known to be involved in sulfide metabolism, we performed Western blots. Proteins were extracted from cell pellets by sonication and from mouse tissues by mechanical homogenization in lysis buffer (50&#160;nM Tris&#8211;HCl, 150&#160;mM NaCl, 1&#160;mM EDTA). To prevent protein degradation, a protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete Mini&#174;, EDTA&#8208;free, 11836170001, Roche) was added to the protein extract and the samples were kept at &#8722;80&#176;C. Cell lysates were quantitated for total protein content using the Bradford system (ThermoScience) and analyzed by electrophoresis in a 12&#8211;15% PAGE gel or Novex 10&#8211;20% Glycine Gel (EC61355, Invitrogen) loading 10/40&#160;&#956;g of protein for sample.

Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay. Equal amount (1.2&#160;mg) of proteins from each sample was incubated with 200&#160;&#956;M NM&#8208;biotin for 30&#160;min with occasionally gentle mixing at room temperature, and subsequently precipitated by cold acetone. After centrifugation, pellets of precipitated proteins from each sample were washed individually with the cold acetone twice and then suspended in denaturation buffer containing urea. The denatured, biotinylated proteins were then diluted with 10 volumes of the suspension buffer and incubated with modified porcine trypsin with mixing for 18&#160;h at 30&#176;C. After the digestion, trypsin was inactivated by incubation at 95&#176;C for 10&#160;min; then, four reaction mixtures (C1, C2, P1, and P4) were mixed separately with the streptavidin&#8208;conjugated agarose beads and incubated at 4&#176;C for 18&#160;h following extensive washes in the presence of low concentration of SDS.

      <text>Mutant skin fibroblasts from patients with CoQ deficiency have reduced SQR&#8208;driven respiration and SQR levels, which correlate with the level of CoQ. Biochemical and molecular abnormalities are partially rescued by CoQ supplementation and recapitulated by down&#8208;regulation of CoQ biosynthesis in fibroblasts and in HeLa cells. Kidneys, the clinically affected organ of the CoQ&#8208;deficient Pdss2&#8208;mutant mice, show reduction in the levels of SQR, and of the other enzymes of the H2S oxidation pathway, accumulation of H2S, and reduced total glutathione levels. Pdss2&#8208;mutant mice have also reduced urine thiosulfate levels and plasma accumulation of C4&#8208;C6 acylcarnitines.</text>
