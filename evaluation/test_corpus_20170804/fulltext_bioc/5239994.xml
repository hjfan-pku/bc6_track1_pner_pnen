      <text>The transcription factor ISGF3, comprised of IRF9 and tyrosine&#8208;phosphorylated STATs 1 and 2, transmits the signal from the type I interferon receptor to the genome. We have discovered a novel phosphorylation of STAT2 on T387 that negatively regulates this response. In most untreated cell types, the majority of STAT2 is phosphorylated on T387 constitutively. In response to interferon&#8208;&#946;, the T387A mutant of STAT2 is much more effective than wild&#8208;type STAT2 in mediating the expression of many interferon&#8208;stimulated genes, in protecting cells against virus infection, and in inhibiting&#160;cell growth. Interferon&#8208;&#946;&#8208;treated cells expressing wild&#8208;type STAT2 contain much less ISGF3 capable of binding to an interferon&#8208;stimulated response element than do cells expressing T387A STAT2. T387 lies in a cyclin&#8208;dependent kinase (CDK) consensus sequence, and CDK inhibitors decrease T387 phosphorylation. Using CDK inhibitors to reverse the constitutive inhibitory phosphorylation of T387 of U&#8208;STAT2 might enhance the efficacy of type I interferons in many different clinical settings.</text>

      <text>Interferons (IFNs) are classified into types I, II, and III (Walter et&#160;al, 1998). The IFNAR1&#8211;IFNAR2 heterodimeric receptor for type I IFNs is ubiquitously expressed and, following IFN binding, transmits the signal through two receptor&#8208;associated tyrosine kinases, tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) and Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), resulting in the phosphorylation of STAT1 at Y701 and STAT2 at Y690. The tyrosine&#8208;phosphorylated STATs hetero&#8208;dimerize and bind to IFN&#8208;regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to form the active transcription factor IFN&#8208;stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). ISGF3 initiates transcription by binding to IFN&#8208;stimulated response elements (ISREs) in the promoters of interferon&#8208;stimulated genes (ISGs) (Platanias, 2005).</text>

      <text>Unlike other family members, STAT2 does not bind to DNA directly (Bluyssen &amp; Levy, 1997). In ISGF3, STAT2 provides a potent transcriptional activation domain that recruits additional co&#8208;factors required to initiate gene expression, including p300/CBP, GCN5, and DRIP150 (Bhattacharya et&#160;al, 1996). Mutant U6A cells, which lack STAT2, do not respond to type I IFNs unless STAT2 expression is restored (Leung et&#160;al, 1995) and mice lacking STAT2 have impaired immune systems and are vulnerable to virus infection (Park et&#160;al, 2000).</text>

      <text>In addition to the essential tyrosine phosphorylations, post&#8208;translational modifications of the STATs contribute important modulation of their functions. For example, STAT1 and STAT3 carry important regulatory phosphorylations on serine 727 residues (Decker &amp; Kovarik, 2000), and STAT3 has a number of regulatory di&#8208;methylations of lysine residues that impact its function (Yang et&#160;al, 2010; Dasgupta et&#160;al, 2015). Compared to other STATs, relatively few post&#8208;translational modifications of STAT2 have been&#160;described. The acetylation of K390 of STAT2 positively regulates the induction of antiviral genes by enhancing the interaction between STAT1 and&#160;STAT2 (Tang et&#160;al, 2007), and mutants of S287 of STAT2 enhance the ability of ISGF3 to bind to DNA (Steen et&#160;al, 2013).</text>

      <text>We now find that a major fraction of STAT2 is constitutively phosphorylated on T387 in most untreated cell types, and that this phosphorylation inhibits signaling in response to type I IFN. Mutation of T387 to A significantly enhances the formation and binding to DNA of the ISGF3 that is formed in response to type I IFN, and this mutation also enhances the antiviral and anti&#8208;proliferative responses of cells treated with IFN&#8208;&#946;.</text>

      <text>We used mass spectrometry to analyze STAT2 immunoprecipitated from 293T cells expressing the Flag&#8208;tagged wild&#8208;type protein. Three different chymotryptic peptides containing pT387 were identified: TSNQKTLpTPEKGQSQGL (C380&#8211;396), TSNQKTLpTPEKGQSQGLIW (C380&#8211;398), and NILTSNQKTLpTPEKGQSQGL (C377&#8211;396). The MS/MS spectrum for the phosphorylated chymotryptic peptide C380&#8211;398 is shown in Fig&#160;1A. This doubly charged peptide has an observed m/z of 1,098.5372&#160;Da and is within &#8722;1.2&#160;ppm of the expected mass. The spectrum is dominated by H3PO4 loss, consistent with the presence of a phosphorylated S or T residue. The mass difference between the y12 and y11 ions is consistent with phosphorylation at T387. The degree of modification, determined from chromatograms of the unmodified and modified forms of the T387 chymotryptic peptides C380&#8211;396 and C380&#8211;398 (Fig&#160;1B, left), was 85% in the untreated sample (Fig&#160;1B, right).</text>

      <text>STAT2 does not recognize the ISRE element by binding to DNA directly; rather, it contributes a potent transcriptional activation domain to ISGF3. T387 is located in the so&#8208;called DNA&#8208;binding domain of STAT2 (Fig&#160;1C), which is defined by its homology to similar regions on other STAT family members. The amino acid sequence surrounding T387 in human STAT2 is highly conserved across several other mammalian species (Fig&#160;1D), consistent with the possibility that the phosphorylation of this residue might have an important function.</text>

      <text>We mutated threonine 387 to alanine to prevent its phosphorylation and then expressed either Flag&#8208;tagged wild&#8208;type or T387A STAT2 in STAT2&#8208;deficient U6A cells, followed by analysis of the IFN&#8208;&#946;&#8208;induced expression of some typical ISGs by quantitative real&#8208;time PCR (qPCR). The T387A mutation dramatically enhanced the expression of IFIT1, IFIT3, DDX58 and OAS1 at 4&#160;h, but did not affect the expression or tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 or STAT2 (Figs&#160;2A and EV1A). As a control, we repeated the same experiment in 293T and human mammary epithelial (HME) cells to show that increased levels of STAT2, due to expression of the Flag&#8208;tagged wild&#8208;type protein, did not change gene expression in response to IFN&#8208;&#946; substantially (Fig&#160;EV1B and C). We also analyzed IFN&#8208;&#946;&#8208;induced gene expression in U6A cells stably expressing the phospho&#8208;mimetic T387D mutant of STAT2. Compared with the wild&#8208;type protein, the T387D mutant showed higher ISG induction in response to IFN&#8208;&#946;, similar to the effect of the T387A mutation (Fig&#160;2B). Therefore, a phosphoryl group at T387, and not just a negative charge, is required for the negative regulatory effect on STAT2 function.</text>

      <text>We used an Illumina Gene Expression Array to understand in more detail how T387 phosphorylation affects ISG induction. mRNA preparations from U6A cells expressing wild&#8208;type or T387A STAT2, treated with IFN&#8208;&#946; for 0, 4, 8, or 24&#160;h, were analyzed. Of the 20,292 genes on the array, 124 were induced in cells containing wild&#8208;type STAT2 after 4&#160;h, 139 after 8&#160;h, and 155 after 24&#160;h. Of the total of 260 genes that responded to treatment with IFN&#8208;&#946;, 83 were induced more strongly in cells containing the T387A mutant than in cells containing wild&#8208;type STAT2 (Fig&#160;2C and Table&#160;EV1). A total of 13 genes (listed in Table&#160;1) were preferentially induced at all three times. Most of these genes are well&#8208;known ISGs, encoding proteins that are vital for IFN&#8208;&#946;&#8208;induced functions, especially antiviral defense. Therefore, phosphorylation of T387 STAT2 regulates the transcriptional activity of ISGF3 negatively. We also compared the time courses of induction of many genes in U6A cells expressing T387A STAT2 to their induction in cells expressing the wild&#8208;type protein (Fig&#160;2D). The T387A mutation affects more genes at the early time of 4&#160;h after treatment with IFN&#8208;&#946; than after 24&#160;h.</text>

      <text>To determine whether the differences in gene expression between wild&#8208;type and T387A STAT2 translate into an improved antiviral defense, we studied immortalized HME cells, which are derived from normal tissue and are not tumorigenic. Since the basal expression of STAT2 is low in HME cells, we stably expressed either Flag&#8208;tagged wild&#8208;type, T387A, or T387D STAT2, at comparable levels in these cells (Fig&#160;3A). The cells were infected for 2&#160;h with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a negative single&#8208;stranded RNA virus, with or without IFN&#8208;&#946; pre&#8208;treatment. Without IFN&#8208;&#946;, all the cells were infected, as shown by the presence of GFP&#8208;tagged VSV (Fig&#160;EV2A). We also quantified VSV&#8208;M protein expression by Western blot (Fig&#160;3A). In the presence of IFN&#8208;&#946;, expression of the viral M&#8208;protein and virus replication was dramatically inhibited in HME cells expressing either T387A or T387D STAT2, compared to cells expressing wild&#8208;type STAT2. A similar result was observed with U6A cells expressing wild&#8208;type or mutant STAT2 proteins (Fig&#160;EV2B and C). We also examined the effect of preventing T387 phosphorylation after several cycles of virus replication. HME cells expressing wild&#8208;type, T387A, or T387D STAT2 were infected with VSV at multiplicities of infection (MOI) from 10 to 10&#8722;3. VSV eventually lysed the infected cells, and we measured the number of cells surviving after 48&#160;h by crystal violet staining and by using the Sigma MTT assay (Fig&#160;3B and C). Cells expressing wild&#8208;type STAT2 were killed completely at 10&#8722;1 MOI of VSV, but cells expressing T387A or T387D STAT2 were &gt;&#160;100 times more resistant to VSV in both assays. We also found that the expression of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) protein ICP0 was strongly inhibited by the T387A mutation, with or without treatment with exogenous IFN&#8208;&#946; (Fig&#160;EV2D). Together, these results reveal that the T387A and T387D mutants of STAT2 significantly enhance the antiviral response to IFN&#8208;&#946;.</text>

      <text>Type I IFNs also inhibit tumor cell proliferation by triggering cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. To investigate whether the phosphorylation of T387 impacts the effect of IFN&#8208;&#946; on cell growth, U6A cells expressing wild&#8208;type or mutant STAT2 proteins were treated with IFN&#8208;&#946; for 96&#160;h and cell viability was measured by the MTT assay (Fig&#160;EV3A). Expression of T387A or T387D STAT2 enhanced the cell growth inhibitory effect of IFN&#8208;&#946; by about 40%, compared to cells expressing wild&#8208;type STAT2 (Fig&#160;3D). A similar result was also observed with HCC827 cells expressing T387A or wild&#8208;type STAT2 (Fig&#160;EV3B). Taken together, these results show that the lack of T387 phosphorylation sensitizes cells to IFN&#8208;&#946; and indicate that the phosphorylation of T387 is a crucial modification of STAT2 that compromises the ability of type I IFNs to inhibit virus replication and cell growth.</text>

      <text>We generated an antibody against a STAT2 peptide with phosphorylated T387 to allow us to investigate the level of T387 phosphorylation in different cells. Endogenous STAT2 from 293T and DLD1 (human colon carcinoma cells) was enriched by immunoprecipitation and analyzed with this antibody (Fig&#160;EV4A). From the mass spectrometric analysis, we found that about 85% of T387 is phosphorylated in 293T cells expressing Flag&#8208;tagged STAT2 (Fig&#160;1B). By determining the ratios of the signals in Western blots for phospho&#8208;threonine 387 and total STAT2 in 293T cells, we calculated the percentage of STAT2 phosphorylated on T387 in other cells. We analyzed two immortalized normal human cell lines (HME cells and BJ foreskin fibroblasts) and five cancer cell lines (HCC827 non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung adenocarcinoma cells, H1650 non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung adenocarcinoma cells, MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma cells, SKBR3 breast adenocarcinoma cells, and LNCaP prostate adenocarcinoma cells). The steady&#8208;state levels of T387 phosphorylation are high in HCC827 and HME cells, but low in H1650 and BJ cells (Figs&#160;4A and EV4B). A high level of endogenous T387 phosphorylation inhibits the sensitivity of specific cells to type I IFN, compromising the ability of type I IFN to inhibit virus replication and cell growth in specific types of cells (Fig&#160;EV4C).</text>

      <text>Human mammary epithelial cells are cultured in a special medium containing five supplements, including EGF, GA1000 (Gentamicin and Amphotericin), BPE (Bovine Pituitary Extract), insulin, and hydrocortisone. Since we observed a high proportion of T387 phosphorylation before IFN&#8208;&#946; treatment, we postulated that one of the five supplements might be responsible. When we deprived the cells of all supplements, they stopped growing and the level of T387 phosphorylation decreased dramatically (Fig&#160;4C). Replenishing all five components at once induced the phosphorylation of T387; when each component was added individually, only hydrocortisone induced this phosphorylation (Fig&#160;4C, lane 3). Since the cells were re&#8208;exposed to the supplements for only 4&#160;h, we surmise that the phosphorylation of T387 of STAT2 is likely to be induced by glucocorticoid signaling. We also observed decreased T387 phosphorylation when we withdrew only hydrocortisone from the complete medium (Fig&#160;EV5A). To understand the function of hydrocortisone in type I IFN&#8208;dependent signaling better, HME cells were pre&#8208;treated with hydrocortisone and then treated with IFN&#8208;&#946;. As shown in Fig&#160;4D, ISG induction is inhibited by hydrocortisone in a dose&#8208;dependent manner. We conclude that hydrocortisone, which activates the glucocorticoid signaling pathway, induces T387 phosphorylation by an as yet unknown mechanism.</text>

      <text>We compared the amino acid sequence surrounding T387 in STAT2 to the sequences that are preferentially recognized by different kinases. Four kinase families, ERK, p38, JNK, and CDK, have consensus sequences containing a threonine&#8211;proline motif (Fig&#160;4E). When we tested specific inhibitors against each, only the pan&#8208;CDK inhibitor affected the phosphorylation of T387 (Fig&#160;4F). We also tested whether this inhibitor enhanced ISG induction by limiting T387 phosphorylation. However, the inhibitor not only inhibited T387 phosphorylation but also entirely ablated ISG induction (Fig&#160;EV5B), making a conclusion impossible. We also used mass spectrometry to analyze proteins bound to STAT2 in U6A cells expressing wild&#8208;type STAT2. CDK1 and CDK9 were identified in this analysis (Table&#160;EV2). In summary, it is likely that one or more kinases in the CDK family are responsible for T387 phosphorylation.</text>

      <text>In response to IFN&#8208;&#946;, STAT2, STAT1, and IRF9 combine to form ISGF3. We observed that more STAT1 and STAT2 were bound to IRF9 in IFN&#8208;&#946;&#8208;treated cells containing the T387A mutant than in cells containing wild&#8208;type STAT2 (Fig&#160;5B, center). We also observed a strong interaction of CDK9 with STAT2 and IRF9, supporting the possibility that CDK9 phosphorylates T387. In untreated cells, the interaction of STAT2 and STAT1 was greatly inhibited by the T387A mutation (Fig&#160;5B, right). We used IRF9&#8208;null U2A cells (Li et&#160;al, 1996) to show that, without IFN&#8208;&#946; treatment and in the absence of IRF9, STAT2 lacking tyrosine phosphorylation (U&#8208;STAT2) forms a heterodimer with U&#8208;STAT1, and wild&#8208;type U&#8208;STAT2 binds to U&#8208;STAT1 much more efficiently than T387A U&#8208;STAT2 (Fig&#160;5C). However, when the tyrosine residues of the two STATs were phosphorylated following treatment with IFN&#8208;&#946; for 4&#160;h, the amount of P&#8208;STAT1/P&#8208;STAT2 heterodimer was similar for wild&#8208;type and T387A mutant STAT2 (Fig&#160;5C). We also tested the effect of STAT2 T387 phosphorylation in the absence of STAT1. More IRF9 was bound to STAT2 in IFN&#8208;&#946;&#8208;treated cells expressing the T387A mutant than in cells expressing wild&#8208;type STAT2 (Fig&#160;5D). It has been reported previously that STAT2 can direct an ISGF3&#8208;like transcriptional response in the absence of STAT1 (Blaszczyk et&#160;al, 2015). We also observed T387 phosphorylation negatively affects this non&#8208;canonical function of STAT2 (Fig&#160;EV5C). These results indicate that the phosphorylation of T387 favors the formation of U&#8208;STAT1/U&#8208;STAT2 heterodimers at the expense of tyrosine&#8208;phosphorylated heterodimers and ISGF3.</text>

      <text>We used whole&#8208;cell lysates for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with an ISRE probe to assess the ability of ISGF3 to bind to DNA. In control U6A cells (which lack STAT2), ISGF3 does not form (Fig&#160;5E, lanes 2 and 5). In U6A cells that express wild&#8208;type STAT2, ISGF3 was detected readily (lanes 3 and 6), but there was much more ISGF3 (normalized to total protein) in the extract of cells expressing the T387A mutant of STAT2 (lane 7). Controls with unlabeled competitor DNA (lane 1) and with antibodies to STAT1, STAT2, or IRF9 (lanes 8&#8211;10) show that the indicated band is indeed ISGF3. We conclude that the amount of ISGF3 capable of binding to an ISRE sequence is greatly enhanced by the T387A mutation of STAT2, either because less ISGF3 is formed when T387 is phosphorylated, or because the threonine&#8208;phosphorylated ISGF3 has a lower affinity for DNA, or both.</text>

The level of STAT2 T387 phosphorylation varies in different cells and decreases after long&#8208;term treatment with IFN&#8208;&#946;. Hydrocortisone inhibits type I IFN&#8208;dependent signaling by increasing STAT2 T387 phosphorylation, consistent with its well&#8208;known function as a negative regulator of the immune response. CDKs, and especially CDK9, are responsible for phosphorylating T387 in untreated cells. T387 phosphorylation increases the level of U&#8208;STAT1/U&#8208;STAT2 heterodimers and decreases the amount of ISGF3 that is formed in response to IFN&#8208;&#946; (Fig&#160;6).</text>

      <text>Although the structure of the U&#8208;STAT1/U&#8208;STAT2 heterodimer is not known, it is very likely to be different from that of the P&#8208;STAT1/P&#8208;STAT2 heterodimer and to resemble the antiparallel structure of the U&#8208;STAT1 homodimer (Mao et&#160;al, 2005; Mertens et&#160;al, 2006). The anti&#8208;parallel homodimer of U&#8208;STAT1 is stabilized by reciprocal interactions between the coiled&#8208;coil domain of one monomer and the DNA&#8208;binding domain of the other (Mertens et&#160;al, 2006). An anti&#8208;parallel conformation of U&#8208;STAT1/U&#8208;STAT2 would need to be rearranged to form functional ISGF3, in which the STAT1 and STAT2 moieties are parallel to each other. This need for this rearrangement can explain the delayed and weaker responses to type I IFN in cells expressing wild&#8208;type STAT2, compared with cells expressing the T387A mutant protein. It is interesting that the phospho&#8208;mimetic mutation T387D has an effect similar to that of T387A, suggesting that T387 phosphorylation functions through a specific mechanism, such as the one proposed above, and not simply by adding a negative charge to this residue.</text>

      <text>Type I IFNs trigger an antiviral state by inducing the expression of genes whose products interfere with many stages of virus replication by many different mechanisms (Yan &amp; Chen, 2012; McNab et&#160;al, 2015). We show that CDK inhibitors decrease T387 phosphorylation, and that the phosphorylation&#8208;deficient T387A mutation increases biological responses to IFN&#8208;&#946;. Viruses achieve resistance to interferon by a variety of mechanisms, including the aberrant activation of certain kinases, and CDK inhibitors have been shown to be potential antiviral drugs by targeting cellular proteins rather than viral proteins (Schang et&#160;al, 2006). We find that CDK9 binds strongly to STAT2 and that CDK inhibitors reduce the phosphorylation of T387. Unlike the other CDKs, CDK9 is involved in the control of gene transcription rather than the cell cycle. It is important to note that a CDK9 inhibitor prevents replication of multiple DNA viruses (Yamamoto et&#160;al, 2014). Our work provides a rationale for using a CDK inhibitor as an antiviral agent in conjunction with type&#160;I IFN.</text>

      <text>Type I IFN can inhibit cancer cell proliferation by inducing the expression of ISGs whose protein products lead to apoptosis and differentiation (Asmana Ningrum, 2014). Type I IFN also regulates the cell cycle by inhibiting the MEK&#8208;ERK signaling pathway (Romerio et&#160;al, 2000). Endogenous IFN induced by DNA damage is required for cancer drugs to eliminate cancer cells (Yu et&#160;al, 2015). However, some cancer cells develop resistance to type I IFN, and we propose that T387 phosphorylation of STAT2 might be one of these mechanisms. Type I IFN also plays important roles in the development and maturation of immune cells (Zitvogel et&#160;al, 2015), and it has been reported that the response of immune cells to type I IFN is compromised by an unknown mechanism in different cancer patients (Critchley&#8208;Thorne et&#160;al, 2009). Cancer cells might take advantage of their microenvironment by releasing cytokines and hormones that activate downstream kinases to phosphorylate STAT2 T387 in immune cells as well as cancer cells. In summary, the phosphorylation of T387 is not only a marker for measuring the responsiveness of cancer cells to type I IFN, but also a pharmaceutical target to sensitize cancer cells to treatment with type I IFNs.</text>

      <text>The findings described in this study indicate that CDK inhibitors may accelerate and augment responses to type I IFNs by decreasing the phosphorylation of T387 of STAT2. Co&#8208;administration of a CDK inhibitor and type I IFN might be a novel strategy for treating cancers such as melanoma, which respond significantly to this therapy (Asghar et&#160;al, 2015), and for treating multiple sclerosis and virus infections. Much more work remains to be done, including understanding how the phosphorylation of T387 modulates the interaction between U&#8208;STAT1 and U&#8208;STAT2, determining which CDKs catalyze T387 phosphorylation, and determining which phosphatases lead to T387 de&#8208;phosphorylation in response to IFN&#8208;&#946;.</text>

      <text>STAT2 protein was purified from 293T cells expressing STAT2 Flag by using Anti&#8208;FLAG&#174; M2 Magnetic Beads (Sigma). For protein digestions, the bands were cut from the gels as closely as possible and washed and de&#8208;stained in 50% ethanol, 5% acetic acid. The gel pieces were then dehydrated in acetonitrile, dried in a Speed&#8208;vac, and digested by adding 5&#160;&#956;l 10&#160;ng/&#956;l of trypsin or chymotrypsin, in 50&#160;mM ammonium bicarbonate, followed by incubation overnight. The peptides were extracted into two portions of 30&#160;&#956;l each 50% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid. The combined extracts were evaporated to &lt; 10&#160;&#956;l in a Speed&#8208;vac and then re&#8208;suspended in 1% acetic acid to make up a final volume of ~30&#160;&#956;l for LC&#8208;MS analysis. The LC&#8208;MS system was a Finnigan LTQ&#8208;Orbitrap Elite hybrid mass spectrometer system. The HPLC column was a Dionex 15&#160;cm&#160;&#215;&#160;75&#160;&#956;m id Acclaim PepMap C18, 2&#160;&#956;m, 100&#160;&#197; reversed&#8208;phase capillary chromatography column. Five microliters of volume of the extract was injected and the peptides, eluted from the column in an acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid gradient at a flow rate of 0.25&#160;&#956;l/min, were introduced into the source of the mass spectrometer online. The micro&#8208;electrospray ion source was operated at 2.5&#160;kV. The digest was analyzed in both a survey manner and a targeted manner. The survey experiments were performed using the data&#8208;dependent multitask capability of the instrument, acquiring full scan mass spectra to determine peptide molecular weights and product ion spectra to determine amino acid sequences in successive instrument scans. The LC&#8208;MS/MS data was searched with the programs Mascot and Sequest against both the full human reference sequence database and specifically against the sequence of Stat2. The parameters used in this search include a peptide mass accuracy of 10&#160;ppm, fragment ion mass accuracy of 0.6&#160;Da, carbamidomethylated cysteines as a constant modification, and oxidized methionine and phosphorylation at S, T, and Y as a dynamic modification. The results were filtered based on Mascot ion scores and Sequest XCorr scores. All positively identified phosphopeptides were manually validated. The targeted experiments involve the analysis of specific STAT2 peptides, including the phosphorylated and unmodified forms of the T387 peptides. The chromatograms for these peptides were plotted based on known fragmentation patterns, and the peak areas of these chromatograms were used to determine the extent of phosphorylation. The mass spectrometry data from this publication have been submitted to the PRIDE database and assigned the project accession PXD005008.</text>
