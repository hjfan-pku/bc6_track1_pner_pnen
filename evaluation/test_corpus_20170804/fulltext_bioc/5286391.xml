      <text>Elongator is a ~850 kDa protein complex involved in multiple processes from transcription to tRNA modification. Conserved from yeast to humans, Elongator is assembled from two copies of six unique subunits (Elp1 to Elp6). Despite the wealth of structural data on the individual subunits, the overall architecture and subunit organization of the full Elongator and the molecular mechanisms of how it exerts its multiple activities remain unclear. Using single&#8208;particle electron microscopy (EM), we revealed that yeast Elongator adopts a bilobal architecture and an unexpected asymmetric subunit arrangement resulting from the hexameric Elp456 subassembly anchored to one of the two Elp123 lobes that form the structural scaffold. By integrating the EM data with available subunit crystal structures and restraints generated from cross&#8208;linking coupled to mass spectrometry, we constructed a multiscale molecular model that showed the two Elp3, the main catalytic subunit, are located in two distinct environments. This work provides the first structural insights into Elongator and a framework to understand the molecular basis of its multifunctionality.</text>

      <text>The Elongator complex is an evolutionarily conserved multisubunit protein complex initially identified as a component of the elongating form of RNA polymerase II 1. Subsequent studies revealed that Elongator participates in various processes, including histone acetylation 2, transcription regulation 3, 4, &#945;&#8208;tubulin acetylation 5, and tRNA modification 6. In particular, Elongator plays an essential role in the addition of 5&#8208;methoxycarbonylmethyl and 5&#8208;carbamoylmethyl to the wobble base pair of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) that stabilizes codon&#8211;anticodon interactions and facilitates translation 7. Because of its broad range of activities, deficiencies in human Elongator have been shown to give rise to serious pathological conditions such as familial dysautonomia and other neurological disorders 8, 9, 10, 11.</text>

      <text>Elongator consists of six unique subunits (Elp1, Elp2, Elp3, Elp4, Elp5, and Elp6), with two copies of each protein associating into a dodecameric ~850 kDa holo&#8208;complex 12, 13. Previous biochemical studies have shown that the Elongator subunits are organized into two subassemblies: one composed of Elp1, Elp2, and Elp3 (Elp123), and the other one composed of Elp4, Elp5, and Elp6 (Elp456) 12, 14. Elp123 houses Elp3, the main catalytic subunit, which contains both a Gcn5&#8208;related N&#8208;acetyltransferase histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain and a radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) domain 15. Elp456 forms a heterohexameric RecA&#8208;like ATPase ring, which possesses ATP&#8208;modulated tRNA binding activity 13. How the multiple catalytic domains of Elongator are regulated is poorly understood.</text>

      <text>Despite a fairly extensive understanding of the domain composition of Elongator and recent advances in delineating the structural properties of individual Elongator subunits (e.g., Elp1 C&#8208;terminal domain, Elp2, and Elp456) 13, 16, 17, 18, the overall architecture and subunit organization of this complex remain unclear. We have isolated the holo&#8208;Elongator complex from yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and obtained the first structural data on this complex using an integrative approach combining single&#8208;particle electron microscopy (EM), cross&#8208;linking coupled to mass spectrometry (CXMS), and multiscale modeling. Our data revealed an unexpected asymmetric overall architecture and subunit organization of Elongator and provided a framework to understand the molecular basis of Elongator's multifunctionality.</text>

      <text>We isolated the full Elongator complex from a S. cerevisiae strain encoding C&#8208;terminally FLAG&#8208;tagged Elp1 (Fig 1A). Densitometry analysis showed that the peak fraction obtained from an identical gradient run without cross&#8208;linker contains stoichiometric quantities of each of the six Elongator subunits (Table EV1), confirming that this procedure preserved the integrity of Elongator. Negative stain EM analysis of purified Elongator showed elongated, bilobal particles with dimensions of approximately 300 &#197; &#215; 200 &#197; (Fig 1B). Subsequent two&#8208;dimensional (2D) classification analysis revealed that Elongator adopts an overall shape resembling a moth, with two prominent triangular&#8208;shaped &#8220;wings&#8221; connected at two corners by a small central density (Fig 1C panel 1).</text>

      <text>The Elongator subunits have been proposed to associate into a symmetric complex, with two Elp123 subcomplexes connected to one another via the hexameric ring assembly formed by Elp456 15. To our surprise, our 2D analysis showed that the majority of Elongator adopts an asymmetric architecture (Fig EV1A). In particular, the most populated 2D class averages of intact Elongator show particles with a ring&#8208;shaped density perched on top of one of the two wings. Interestingly, no particles containing two ring&#8208;shaped densities were observed in our dataset (Fig EV1A). In addition to the unique asymmetric architecture, our 2D analysis also revealed variability in the distance between the two lobes of the complex, with some particles showing a more &#8220;open&#8221; conformation (Fig 1C panel 3, and Fig 1D panel 1) and others a more &#8220;closed&#8221; conformation (Fig 1C panel 4, and Fig 1D panel 3).</text>

      <text>The overall dimensions and hexameric shape of the ring&#8208;shaped density resemble that of the projection view of the Elp456 crystal structure (Fig 1E). To determine whether Elp456 constitutes this density, we isolated the Elp123 subcomplex from the Elp1&#8208;FLAG strain using a high salt purification strategy that dissociates Elp456 from the full Elongator complex 14. Class averages obtained from 2D EM analysis of purified Elp123 show particles with both lobes lacking the ring&#8208;shaped density (Figs 1D and EV1B and C). This result not only confirmed that Elp456 indeed binds to only one half of the Elp123 dimer in the intact complex but also showed that two Elp123 subcomplexes can dimerize in the absence of Elp456.</text>

      <text>We next took an EM&#8208;based labeling approach to further investigate the organization of Elp123. We isolated Elongator containing C&#8208;terminal maltose binding protein (MBP) tagged Elp2 or Elp3 and localized the MBP labels by negative stain EM. We found that Elongator containing either MBP&#8208;tagged Elp2 or Elp3 displays additional densities at either the furthest corners or the posterior edge of the Elongator &#8220;wings&#8221; (Fig 1F and G). Only one Elp3&#8208;MBP density could be resolved from our 2D analysis. We attribute this to the class averaging procedure aligning one copy of the tag, while the variable relative position of the second tag resulted in its density being averaged down to background levels. To map the location of Elp1 C&#8208;terminus, we applied a similar EM&#8208;based approach using antibody&#8208;based labeling (Fig 1H). We observed an additional density corresponding to the antibody attaching to the tube&#8208;like density connecting the two Elongator lobes, a location consistent with recent findings that the Elp1 C&#8208;terminal domain mediates complex dimerization 16. Collectively, these results indicate that Elp2 and Elp3 are positioned along the distal corners and posterior edges of the moth&#8208;shaped complex, respectively, while the Elp1 C&#8208;terminus likely forms the bridge between the two lobes of Elongator.</text>

      <text>The limited yield of our native complex purification has prevented us from preparing vitrified specimens and characterizing this complex at higher resolution by cryo&#8208;EM. We therefore determined a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) reconstruction of Elongator from our negative stained specimens (Figs 1I and EV2). The resulting ~25 &#197; resolution structure confirmed that one of the two wing&#8208;shaped lobes houses an additional density with size and shape resembling the Elp456 hexamer. The plane of the Elp456 hexamer is angled approximately 30 degrees away from the complex plane (Fig 1I, top view) with the posterior edge closest to the Elp123 core complex. Aside from the putative Elp456 hexamer, each lobe can be divided into three main densities arranged adjacent to each other. Based on our MBP&#8208;tagging experiments, we assigned the distal and central densities as Elp2 and Elp3, respectively (Fig 1J). Furthermore, the EM density map revealed a slender cavity, approximately 80 &#197; deep, that projects into the Elp123 lobe through the center of the Elp456 hexamer (Fig 1K).</text>

      <text>To gain further insights into the subunit connectivity of Elongator, we generated knockouts of three elp genes (elp1&#916;, elp2&#916;, or elp3&#916;) in a FLAG&#8208;tagged Elp4 background strain, and performing mass spectrometry analysis of anti&#8208;FLAG affinity purified samples from these three yeast strains to determine the effects of these mutations on complex formation (Fig 2A). We found that Elp5 and Elp6 co&#8208;purified with Elp4 in all three mutants, suggesting that the Elp456 ring can assemble independently of Elp123. Our analysis also showed that Elp1 is essential to the binding of Elp2 and Elp3 to Elp456, while Elp2 deletion has no effects on the association of Elp1 and Elp3 to Elp456. Finally, Elp3 deletion severely disrupts Elp2 but not Elp1 binding to Elp4. Results from these studies are consistent with the observed peripheral location of Elp2 and in addition indicated that Elp1 not only mediates complex dimerization but also serves as the major scaffold for other Elongator subunits to assemble.</text>

We hypothesized that these loops are important for Elp2's role in Elongator function, possibly in stabilizing major interaction interfaces. We introduced alanine mutations to the conserved residues within four loops (Fig 3A) and examined their effects on Elongator function. We found that mutations in loops 1, 3, and 4 of Elp2 cause impaired growth on plates containing caffeine (Fig 3B). These mutants are also resistant to the Kluyveromyces lactis toxin zymocin, which specifically cleaves tRNA harboring U34 (wobble position) modification (Fig 3C) 20. Both these phenotypes are consistent with impaired Elongator function 12, 21.</text>

      <text>We next evaluated the association of these Elp2 mutants to other Elongator subunits. We purified Elongator from strains expressing the Elp2 loop mutants and Elp4&#8208;FLAG using anti&#8208;FLAG affinity chromatography and probed the eluted proteins by Western blot (Fig 3D). We found that the Elp2 loop 2 mutations did not affect co&#8208;purification with Elp4&#8208;FLAG. By contrast, the loop 1 mutation results in substantially reduced level of Elp2 co&#8208;purified with Elp4 (Fig 3D). The loop 3 and 4 mutations led to a mild reduction in co&#8208;purification, suggesting that these loops mediate Elp2 function aside from complex assembly. These results confirm that the highly cross&#8208;linked, conserved residues in the loop 1, loop 3, and loop 4 regions of Elp2 are critical for Elongator function.</text>

      <text>To visualize the overall architecture of Elongator, we took a multiscale modeling approach that involves integrating: (i) EM mapping data; (ii) the subunit cross&#8208;linking patterns; (iii) the available crystal structures of Elp1 C&#8208;terminal domain 16, Elp2 17, and the core Elp456 hexamer 13; and (iv) and homology models of the Elp1 N&#8208;terminal WD40 and the Elp3 HAT and radical SAM domains to derive a &#8220;best fit&#8221; multiscale model representing the approximate overall architecture of Elongator (Fig 4). The Elp1 N&#8208;terminal tandem WD40 domains fitted to two stacked disk&#8208;shaped density in the junction between the two Elongator lobes (Fig 4A). Fitting of the Elp1 C&#8208;terminal dimerization domain, Elp2, and Elp3 was all consistent with the EM labeling experiments: Elp2 to the distal ends of the complex, Elp3 to the center of each lobe, and Elp1 C&#8208;terminus in the slender junction bridging the two lobes of the complex (Fig 4A). The X&#8208;ray structure of Elp456 fit unambiguously to the six&#8208;membered ring&#8208;shaped density consistent found in both 2D and 3D reconstructions of the intact complex (Fig 4B). The cavity through the center of the Elp456 ring is large and deep enough for a tRNA molecule to bind (Fig 4C).</text>

      <text>Our model is consistent with our CXMS results, with direct access between cross&#8208;linked lysine pairs (Fig 4D). However, the distance between several Elp2&#8208;Elp1N cross&#8208;links exceeds the predicted DSS length. This is likely due to a combination of imperfect homology modeling of the Elp1 N&#8208;terminal WD40 domains and potential conformational flexibility of the Elp123 lobe. Flexibility within macromolecules often result in the violation of the allowable intersubunit cross&#8208;linking length 22, 23, and movement within the Elp123 lobe may transiently shorten the distance between Elp1 and Elp2.</text>

      <text>The resulting model shows that the two Elp1 subunits form a central scaffold and dimerize at their C&#8208;terminal regions, linking the two wing&#8208;shaped lobes. Elp1, Elp2, and Elp3 constitute the three adjoining densities forming the central framework of the complex. The lone Elp456 ring is anchored to one of the two Elp123 lobes. The 80 &#197; deep cavity spanning the center of Elp456 contacts the Elp3 HAT and radical SAM domains extensively (Fig 5B). Since residues lining the center of the hexamer were shown to be important for tRNA binding 13, and that this cavity can accommodate a tRNA molecule (Fig 5C), we speculate that this cavity might serve as the tRNA binding site.</text>

      <text>Our Elongator molecular model showed that the two Elp123 lobes are arranged in an asymmetric fashion. An implication of this finding is that Elp123 undergoes a conformational change upon binding of one Elp456 ring. To characterize this structural rearrangement further, we determined the three&#8208;dimensional reconstruction of the Elp123 subcomplex and then overlaid this structure into the EM density map of full Elongator (Figs 5C and EV4). Our analysis revealed that Elp123 adopts a more extended conformation (Figs 5C, front view, and EV4E) and a different rotational state relative to the putative Elp1 C&#8208;terminal bridge (Figs 5C, top view, and EV4F) compared to Elp123 within the full Elongator.</text>

      <text>In addition to potentially enhancing interaction between Elp456 and Elp123, the observed conformational change of Elp123 might function to preclude the loading of a second Elp456 ring on the opposite Elp123 lobe. To test this hypothesis, we first need to verify that native Elongator contains only one Elp456 ring. Because Elp456 is sensitive to dissociation from the holo&#8208;complex in high salt conditions, we isolated Elongator from yeast cells using low salt buffer conditions (75 mM NaCl). Despite the presence of higher amount of contaminants in the purified complex, we were able to conduct 2D EM analysis on this &#8220;low salt&#8221; sample. The most populated class averages from this analysis show asymmetric, single Elp456&#8208;loaded particles that are indistinguishable from those obtained for Elongator purified using 150 mM NaCl (Figs 6A and B, and EV5A). However, to our surprise, we did detect a minor population of particles that contain prominent densities on both lobes (Fig 6B, class average indicated by a white triangle), suggesting that Elongator can accommodate two bound Elp456 rings.</text>

      <text>To determine whether our purification procedure affects the Elp456 loading state of Elongator, we incubated native Elongator purified from yeast in buffer containing 150 mM NaCl with recombinant, catalytically active full&#8208;length Elp456 (rElp456) reconstituted in Escherichia coli (Figs 6C and EV5B and C) and subjected this mixture to glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation followed by Coomassie&#8208;stained SDS&#8211;PAGE and 2D EM analyses (Figs 6D&#8211;F and EV5D). As opposed to rElp456 which did not penetrate past the first three fractions of the same glycerol gradient (Fig 6D), a significant amount of externally supplied rElp456 co&#8208;migrated with the peak fractions corresponding to Elongator (Fig 6E). Densitometry analysis of the protein bands from the peak fraction revealed that there is approximately twice as much Elp4, Elp5, and Elp6 compared to Elp1 (Table EV3). Furthermore, the most populated class averages from 2D EM analysis of the peak fraction show particles with two hexameric ring&#8208;shaped densities decorating each of its two lobes (Figs 6F and EV5D). Collectively, these results confirm that the two copies of Elp456 subcomplexes can be stably anchored to Elongator even in moderate salt conditions we used in our purification procedure, and that the observed single&#8208;loaded nature of our purified native complex potentially results from limiting quantities of Elp456 in the yeast cytoplasm.</text>

      <text>This study presented the first comprehensive structural investigation of the intact Elongator complex. Previous studies have shown that Elongator is inherently dimeric and consists of two copies of six unique protein subunits 13. Glatt et al proposed that Elp456 acts as a centrally located bridge between the two Elp123 subcomplexes. However, this model was challenged by the recent crystallographic analysis of the Elp1 C&#8208;terminal domain, which revealed that this domain self&#8208;dimerizes and facilitates Elongator dimerization 16. Our results clearly show that the Elp456 heterohexamer is anchored to only one Elp123 lobe and distal to the dimerization interface. The 3D reconstruction of Elongator shows a long and slender bridging density, consistent with the alpha&#8208;helical repeats of the C&#8208;terminal TPR/IKAP dimerization domain 16. Therefore, we conclude that Elongator is an asymmetric &#8220;dimer of multimers&#8221; likely connected by the Elp1 C&#8208;terminal region. These findings were validated by a similar negative stain EM&#8208; and CXMS&#8208;based study of yeast Elongator from the M&#252;ller group, who obtained an essentially identical structure and observed similar subunit arrangement 24. We also observed that Elp123 changes conformation upon Elp456 binding (Fig 5C). Interestingly, the family of RecA&#8208;like ATPases that Elp456 belongs to contain many examples of molecular motors, such as helicases and transporters that utilize NTPs to conduct mechanical work 25. The conformational changes of Elp123 could potentially be induced by Elp456's catalytic activity.</text>

      <text>The mechanism limiting Elp456 association to only one Elp123 lobe is not known. We observed that the majority of front views of the complex contain only one copy of the Elp456 ring. A minor population of particles generated a class average with no discernable ring densities essentially identical to the class averages of the purified Elp123 subcomplex (Fig EV1A and C). Furthermore, none of the class averages we obtained for full Elongator show two Elp456 rings associated with both Elp123 lobes. However, we show that incubating purified Elongator with an excess of recombinant Elp456 subcomplexes results in the association of two heterohexameric rings to both Elp123 lobes (Fig 6F). This experiment indicates that there is no direct mechanism preventing double loading of Elp456 subcomplexes to Elp123. However, we also show that complexes purified from yeast, even under low salt conditions, mostly only contain one Elp456 ring (Fig 6B). Elongator stoichiometry may therefore be regulated at the level of expression to control to available pool of Elp456. Indeed, Elp1, Elp2, and Elp3 have been shown to be more abundant in the cell than Elp4, Elp5, and Elp6 26.</text>

      <text>Our study provides the first insight into the structure of the holo&#8208;Elongator complex. In order to improve upon our architectural model, high&#8208;resolution structural data on the Elp1 N&#8208;terminal domain and Elp3 as well as the intact complex will be required. Whether Elongator contains two copies of the Elp456 heterohexamer in vivo remains an open question. We and others have shown that purified Elongator is most stable in conditions that result in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 subunit stoichiometry 12, 13, but whether the 1:1:1:2:2:2 complex is present and functional in vivo still needs to be addressed in future studies.</text>

Freeze&#8208;ground yeast was resuspended in lysis buffer (40 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 50 mM NaF, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 2 mM benzamidine, and cOmplete EDTA&#8208;free protease inhibitor [Roche]) and pre&#8208;cleared by ultracentrifugation at 154,000 &#215; g for 30 min. Clarified lysate was incubated with 500 &#956;l anti&#8208;FLAG M2 resin (Sigma&#8208;Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 4&#176;C for 1 h. The resin was collected and washed three times with lysis buffer without inhibitors, incubated with 2.5 &#956;g/ml RNase A for 30 min at 4&#176;C, and washed 3&#215; with lysis buffer without inhibitors. Bound Elongator was eluted with 2 &#215; 500 &#956;l of elution buffer (lysis buffer without inhibitors containing 500 &#956;g/ml 3&#215;FLAG peptide (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ). Further purity was achieved by subjecting the FLAG eluate to glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation. More specifically, 200 &#956;l of eluate was overlaid onto a linear 15&#8211;30% glycerol gradient, ultracentrifuged at 76,000 &#215; g using an SW 55 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA), and fractionated using the Gradient Station (BioComp, Fredericton, Canada). For the final 3D reconstruction of Elongator, we utilized the GraFix method to enhance stability of the purified complex, with a glutaraldehyde gradient of 0&#8211;0.05% added to the glycerol gradient 27. The initial random conical tilt model was prepared using Elongator particles isolated by glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation without glutaraldehyde. Preparation of Elongator in low salt conditions utilizes an identical purification procedure, except all buffers used contain 75 mM NaCl as opposed to 150 mM.</text>

      <text>To determine the 3D reconstruction of Elongator, we first obtained an initial model using the random conical tilt approach implemented in the SPIDER software suite 29. In brief, tilt pair particles from the tilt pair dataset were selected using WEB, with the untilted particles subjected to alignment and classification. Tilted particles from the most populated classes were used to calculate a reconstruction using the back projection procedure.</text>

      <text>For the final Elongator reconstruction, we collected 100 micrographs which were phase&#8208;flip CTF corrected using CTFFIND3 and SPIDER (final pixel size 7.0 &#197;/pixel) 29, 30. The micrographs were subjected to template&#8208;based autopicking in RELION to obtain a total of 17,074 particles 31. These particles were then aligned and classified using maximum likelihood methods and the averages for each class calculated using RELION (Fig EV1). These class averages were used for the 2D analysis of intact Elongator. Bad particles were excluded to yield a particle count of 9,962. The particles were then subjected to RELION 3D classification using the RCT model as a reference. Classes of inferior quality were discarded for a final particle count of 8,190. The final set of particles were used to refine the most highly populated class from 3D classification using RELION's auto&#8208;refine feature. At no point did we discriminate between &#8220;open&#8221; and &#8220;closed&#8221; lobe conformations of the complex. After postprocessing without map sharpening, a final resolution of 25 &#197; was calculated at the 0.143 FSC criterion using the gold&#8208;standard method 32. Details on this process can be found in Fig EV2.</text>

      <text>For subunit localization 2D image analysis, all micrographs were binned twice to give a final pixel size of 4.67 &#197;/pixel. Individual particles were selected using EMAN Boxer 33. Particle images were then aligned and classified in either SPIDER 29 or RELION to generate the class averages. No significant differences between the performances of these two software suites were detected. Particles from class averages showing additional C&#8208;terminal MBP tag density were subjected to a second round of alignment and classification to further segregate particles with the additional MBP density. The same procedure of classification and subclassification was employed to determine the location of the anti&#8208;FLAG antibody bound to Elongator containing Elp1&#8208;FLAG.</text>

      <text>FLAG&#8208;purified Elongator (without glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation) was incubated with either 40, 80, 160, 240, 320, 480, or 640 &#956;M of disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) for 30 min at room temperature. This range of cross&#8208;linker concentrations was determined to generate both lightly and extensively cross&#8208;linked complexes by SDS&#8211;PAGE across two experiments with slightly different preparation methods until a satisfactory number of cross&#8208;linked peptides were detected. Reactions were quenched using 50 mM Tris&#8211;HCl pH 8.0 for 15 min at room temperature. Cross&#8208;linked samples were separated on 5&#8211;20% SDS&#8211;PAGE (Bio&#8208;Rad, Hercules, CA) followed by Coomassie Blue G&#8208;250 staining (Fig EV3). The high molecular weight band corresponding to the cross&#8208;linked complex was excised and subsequently processed for mass spectrometry analysis as previously described 34. Both experimental samples were digested with a combination of 10 ng/&#956;l trypsin and 5 ng/&#956;l Lys&#8208;C. Digested products were analyzed on a Q Exactive MS instrument equipped with an Easy nano&#8208;LC 1000 liquid chromatography system (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Digested peptides (~0.5 &#956;g) were loaded onto 75 &#956;m &#215; 6 cm trap column that was packed with 10 &#956;m, 120 &#197; ODS&#8208;AQ C18 resin (YMC, Kyoto, Japan) and connected through a microTee to a 75 &#956;m &#215; 10 cm analytical column packed with 1.8 &#956;m, 120 &#197; UHPLC&#8208;XB&#8208;C18 resin (Welch Materials, Shanghai, China). Peptides were separated over a 100&#8208;min linear gradient from 100% buffer A (0.1% FA) to 30% buffer B (100% ACN, 0.1% FA) and then a 10&#8208;min gradient from 30% to 80% buffer B, reaching 100% buffer B in the next 1 min and maintaining at 100% buffer B for 2 min before returning to 100% buffer A in 3 min and ending with a 4&#8208;min 100% buffer A wash.
