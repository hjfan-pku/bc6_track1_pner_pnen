      <text>MicroRNA (miRNA)&#8208;guided mRNA repression, mediated by the miRNA&#8208;induced silencing complex (miRISC), is an important component of post&#8208;transcriptional gene silencing. However, how miRISC identifies the target mRNA in vivo is not well understood. Here, we show that the nucleoporin Nup358 plays an important role in this process. Nup358 localizes to the nuclear pore complex and to the cytoplasmic annulate lamellae (AL), and these structures dynamically associate with two mRNP granules: processing bodies (P bodies) and stress granules (SGs). Nup358 depletion disrupts P bodies and concomitantly impairs the miRNA pathway. Furthermore, Nup358 interacts with AGO and GW182 proteins and promotes the association of target mRNA with miRISC. A well&#8208;characterized SUMO&#8208;interacting motif (SIM) in Nup358 is sufficient for Nup358 to directly bind to AGO proteins. Moreover, AGO and PIWI proteins interact with SIMs derived from other SUMO&#8208;binding proteins. Our study indicates that Nup358&#8211;AGO interaction is important for miRNA&#8208;mediated gene silencing and identifies SIM as a new interacting motif for the AGO family of proteins. The findings also support a model wherein the coupling of miRISC with the target mRNA could occur at AL, specialized domains within the ER, and at the nuclear envelope.</text>

      <text>Regulation of gene expression at the translational level is shown to be involved in diverse cellular processes and has emerged as an area of intense investigation. Small non&#8208;coding RNAs, particularly microRNAs (miRNAs), appear to significantly contribute to this layer of regulation. miRNAs, which are of ~22 nucleotides length, suppress translation of mRNAs that possess partial or complete sequence complementarity, mostly at the 3&#8242;&#8208;untranslated region (UTR) 1. Predictions based on sequence analysis have indicated that miRNAs could target over 50% of human protein&#8208;coding genes 2. The genes encoding miRNAs are generally transcribed by RNA polymerase II to produce primary miRNAs (pri&#8208;miRNAs), which are processed into precursor miRNAs (pre&#8208;miRNAs) by the microprocessor complex containing Drosha and DGCR8 in the nucleus 3. The pre&#8208;miRNA, in complex with exportin&#8208;5 and RanGTP, is exported through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) into the cytoplasm, where it is further processed by Dicer into double&#8208;stranded miRNA. One of the strands stably associates with Argonaute (AGO) protein to generate a functional miRISC. Humans have four AGO isoforms: AGO1&#8211;AGO4 4. A glycine&#8211;tryptophan (GW)&#8208;rich protein, GW182 (also called TNRC6), interacts directly with AGO proteins and is essential for miRISC&#8208;mediated translational repression and/or degradation of target mRNAs through recruitment of deadenylation and decapping complexes. The suppression and/or degradation of target mRNAs is believed to occur in the cytoplasmic foci termed as &#8220;processing bodies (P bodies)&#8221; 5, 6. As downstream effectors, GW182 family of proteins directly bind to AGO proteins through conserved GW/WG sequence. This motif is also present in other AGO&#8208;interacting proteins and is referred to as &#8220;AGO hook&#8221; 7, 8.</text>

      <text>Argonaute proteins have a highly conserved role in RNA silencing 4. AGO family is divided into two clades based on their functions: AGO and PIWI subfamilies. As described earlier, AGO subfamily proteins are present ubiquitously and are involved in small interfering RNA (siRNA)&#8208;mediated cleavage of mRNA or miRNA&#8208;mediated suppression of mRNA translation 4. However, the members of PIWI subclade are mostly present in germ cells and are involved in silencing transposons, maintenance of genome integrity, and gametogenesis 9.</text>

      <text>Although the subcellular location where the loading of miRNAs to AGO proteins (miRISC formation) and association of miRISC with the target mRNAs occur is not well understood, recent studies have indicated a role for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in these processes. It was shown that Arabidopsis AGO1 associates peripherally with ER, and miRISC could inhibit the translation of target mRNAs on the ER 10. Another study indicated that rough ER could be the site for miRNA and siRNA loading to AGO proteins and translational regulation of target mRNAs 11. A central question that is yet unresolved is how miRISC identifies the target mRNAs in vivo. Although a sorting mechanism could be envisaged that couples the RNAs exported from the nucleus with the miRISC, there is no available evidence for the existence of such machinery.</text>

      <text>The nuclear envelope (NE) that encircles the nucleus is an extension of ER and is made up of a double&#8208;layered membrane. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) form the molecular gates on the NE, through which the transport of macromolecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm occurs 12. The protein components of NPCs are termed as nucleoporins (Nups), and each mammalian NPC contains around 30 different nucleoporins in multiple copies 13. The spatial distribution of individual nucleoporins within the NPC structure could vary 14. Although the nucleoporins are fundamentally expected to be involved in the regulation of nucleo&#8208;cytoplasmic transport, several of them are shown to have multiple other functions 15, 16.</text>

      <text>Apart from the localization to NPCs on the NE, some nucleoporins also accumulate in annulate lamellae (AL), which are stacked ER membrane&#8208;containing pore&#8208;like structures 17, 18, 19. These AL pore complexes show gross structural similarities to that of NPCs at electron microscopy level 17, 19. Although AL structures have been extensively analyzed in male and female gametes, other proliferating non&#8208;germ cells also possess varying quantities of AL 17, 19. The functional role for these structures in any cellular processes is unclear. Previous studies have implicated AL as the storehouse of excess nucleoporins to be supplied as and when the cell requires, for example, to meet the increasing demand for nucleoporins in the assembly of new NPCs during initial zygotic cell divisions. However, there is experimental evidence arguing against such a function 20. Consistent with being a part of the endoplasmic reticulum, electron microscopic studies also have suggested AL to often have RNA and ribosomes in their close vicinity 17, 19. Previous studies have shown that AL associate with MEX&#8208;3&#8208;positive RNP granules in the arrested Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes and that several nucleoporins play a role in the complete assembly of these RNP granules 21. However, whether AL associate with other mRNP granules and play a role in their functions is not known.</text>

      <text>Nup358 is a nucleoporin that localizes to the cytoplasmic side of the NPC and has been implicated in several functions 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. Depletion of Nup358 does not appear to grossly affect transport of macromolecules across the NE, although some studies suggest a role for this nucleoporin in specific receptor&#8208; and cargo&#8208;dependent transport 32, 33, 34, 35, 36. Nup358 has been identified as a small ubiquitin&#8208;like modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase 28 and is shown to mediate in vivo SUMOylation of substrates such as topoisomerase II 37, borealin 38, and Ran 39.</text>

      <text>SUMO is a small protein that gets covalently conjugated to target proteins through specific lysine residues and modulates their function 40, 41. SUMO pathway is shown to be involved in multiple cellular processes 42. In humans, there are four SUMO isoforms: SUMO1&#8211;4. In addition to the covalent interaction, SUMO associates with other proteins through directly binding to specific SUMO&#8208;interacting motif (SIM), which is characterized by a conserved set of hydrophobic amino acids 40, 41. Multiple SIMs have been identified in many SUMO&#8208;interacting proteins and functionally validated 43. The presence of a stretch of negatively charged amino acids adjacent to the N&#8208; or C&#8208;terminus of the hydrophobic sequence (SIM) is shown to contribute to the strength, orientation, and paralog specificity of SUMO binding 42.</text>

      <text>SUMO conjugation to the substrate lysine requires concerted action of SUMO&#8208;specific E1 (Aos1/Uba2 heterodimer), E2 (Ubc9), and multiple E3 ligases 42. RanGTPase&#8208;activating protein (RanGAP) is the first SUMO substrate identified 44, 45, 46. SUMO gets attached to lysine 524 of human RanGAP, which targets it to the NPC through binding to Nup358. Structural and functional analyses showed that SUMO&#8208;RanGAP interacts with Nup358 through a region having internal repeats (IR) harboring two SIMs 47, 48. Nup358&#8208;IR also possesses the SUMO E3 ligase activity 28. Each of the two repeats, IR1 and IR2, has a SIM&#8208;binding and a Ubc9&#8208;binding domain 49, 50. However, studies have shown that IR1 (SIM1) is involved in SUMO~RanGAP1 interaction, which is stabilized by Ubc9 as it directly binds to IR1, RanGAP1, and SUMO 47, 51. In vitro studies have illustrated that SUMO&#8208;RanGAP and Ubc9 form a stable complex with IR1, and not with IR2 51, 52, 53. Although no conclusive evidence exists, it is believed that SUMO&#8208;dependent binding of RanGAP1 to Nup358 would enhance RanGAP's ability to activate the hydrolysis of GTP on Ran in the export complex 54, 55. Endogenously, bulk of RanGAP is SUMO&#8208;modified and has been shown to associate with Nup358 throughout the cell cycle 25, 56.</text>

      <text>Here, we show that Nup358&#8208;positive AL structures dynamically associate with cytoplasmic mRNPs such as P bodies and stress granules (SGs). Furthermore, our study reveals interaction between Nup358 and components of miRISC, AGO, and GW182. The results suggest an unanticipated function for this nucleoporin in miRNA&#8208;mediated gene silencing by aiding in the coupling of miRISC with target mRNAs. The results also indicate a possible role for AL in the miRISC&#8211;mRNA coupling process. Interestingly, characterization of Nup358&#8211;AGO interaction led to identification of SIM as a new conserved interaction motif for AGO family of proteins. Our data also suggest that Nup358&#8211;AGO interaction is essential for miRNA&#8208;mediated suppression of mRNA translation.</text>

      <text>Localization of endogenous Nup358 in HeLa cells using a specific antibody showed that, in addition to NE, this nucleoporin is present in cytoplasmic punctate structures along with RanGAP1, a known interacting partner of Nup358 (Fig 1A) 45, 46. To validate whether the cytoplasmic Nup358&#8208;positive structures represented AL, we immunostained for other nucleoporins and found these entities to contain Nup214 (Fig 1A) and Nup62 (Fig EV1A), but not Nup153 (Fig EV1A). Moreover, these Nup358&#8208;positive structures were associated with ER, particularly marking distinct domains within the ER (Fig EV1B). Co&#8208;localization with a set of nucleoporins and association with ER indicated that Nup358&#8208;positive cytoplasmic structures represented the previously characterized AL 57, 58. Exogenously expressed GFP&#8208;tagged Nup358 (GFP&#8208;Nup358) also accumulated in AL, as confirmed by its co&#8208;localization with AL&#8208;specific nucleoporins such as Nup214 and Nup62 (Fig EV1C).</text>

      <text>The nature and origin of AL have been unclear, and to monitor these, we analyzed the dynamics of GFP&#8208;Nup358&#8208;labeled AL using live cell imaging (Movie EV1). We observed that AL were highly dynamic and often underwent homotypic fusion with neighboring AL structures. Interestingly, we noticed that some AL structures were budding off from the NE and fusing with the pre&#8208;existing cytoplasmic AL (Fig 1B and Movie EV2). These results suggested that cytoplasmic AL could originate from NE and are extensively dynamic entities.</text>

      <text>Further, we sought to investigate the distribution of AL in relation to other cytoplasmic structures. Interestingly, we found that two cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) granules, namely SGs and P bodies, were often associated with or present juxtaposed to AL (Fig 1C). We subjected HeLa cells to oxidative stress through sodium arsenite treatment to induce SGs 59 and immunostained for endogenous Nup358, eIF3&#951; (SG marker), and Dcp1a (P body marker). P bodies and SGs were found often juxtaposed to each other in the cytoplasm as previously reported 59. Interestingly, we observed that many individual Nup358&#8208;positive AL structures were present adjacent to SGs or P bodies, and in some cases, all three structures appeared to physically associate with each other (Fig 1C). Quantitative analysis suggested that ~20% of P bodies were associated with either Nup358&#8208;positive AL or SGs, whereas ~50% of them were found to be associated with neither AL nor SGs, and ~6% were associated with the NE (Fig 1C). Similarly, ~20% of SGs were associated with either Nup358&#8208;positive AL or P bodies, whereas ~50% of them were found to be associated with neither AL nor P bodies, and ~10% were associated with the NE (Fig 1C). In unstressed cells, ~16% of endogenous P bodies associated with Nup358&#8208;positive AL structures. The physical association was much more striking when GFP&#8208;Nup358 was exogenously expressed along with RFP&#8208;Dcp1a (P body marker) or RFP&#8208;G3BP1 (SG marker) (Fig EV1D and E). Under this condition, ~47% of P bodies associated with Nup358&#8208;positive AL, whereas &lt; 10% associated with the NE (Fig EV1D). Similarly, ~58% of SGs were present juxtaposed to Nup358&#8208;positive AL and ~10% were associated with NE (Fig EV1E). Live cell imaging, interestingly, indicated a dynamic interplay between the two mRNP granules and Nup358&#8208;positive AL/NE (Movies EV3 and EV4).</text>

      <text>The dynamic association of Nup358&#8208;positive AL/NE with SGs and P bodies prompted us to investigate whether any functional link exists between these entities. Toward this, we tested whether siRNA&#8208;mediated Nup358 depletion caused any effect on the assembly of mRNP granules. Removal of Nup358 did not have any gross effect on SG assembly (assessed by SG&#8208;specific marker, eIF3&#951;) as compared to control cells (Fig EV1F). Neither did depletion of Nup214, another nucleoporin present on the cytoplasmic face of NPC and AL, show any effect on SG assembly (Fig EV1G). Interestingly, knockdown of Nup358, but not Nup214, led to dramatic impairment of P body assembly as assessed by Dcp1a staining (Fig 1D). However, the levels of Dcp1a were comparable between control and Nup358 knockdown cells (Fig 1D). These results demonstrated a specific requirement for Nup358 in P body formation, and possibly in its function.</text>

      <text>Previous studies have shown that mRNAs suppressed by miRISC localize to P bodies 5, 6, and disturbances in miRNA pathway lead to disruption of microscopically visible distinct P body structures 60. We sought to find out whether Nup358 depletion affected the miRNA pathway. As let&#8208;7a is one of the abundant miRNAs expressed in HeLa cells, a Renilla luciferase (RL) reporter construct that expresses RL mRNAs containing three imperfect let&#8208;7a binding sites in its 3&#8242;&#8208;UTR (RL&#8208;3xBulge) was used to monitor let&#8208;7a&#8208;mediated translation suppression in HeLa cells 61. Compared to control Renilla luciferase (RL&#8208;control) mRNAs that did not have any let&#8208;7a binding site, RL&#8208;3xBulge generally showed ~60% suppression (Fig 2B). We measured the RL activity in cells depleted of Dicer, Nup214, or Nup358 (Fig 2A) and found that similar to Dicer knockdown, Nup358 depletion caused significant reversal of miRNA&#8208;mediated suppression (Fig 2B). Cells with Nup214 knockdown, however, showed no significant change in the reporter activity as compared to control siRNA&#8208;treated cells (Fig 2B). These results indicated a specific role for Nup358 in miRNA function.</text>

      <text>To test the generality of Nup358 function in miRNA pathway, we utilized another miRNA reporter system in HEK293T cells, involving firefly luciferase (FL) that contains eight miR&#8208;30a perfect binding sites (sequence with complete complementarity to miR&#8208;30a) in the 3&#8242;&#8208;UTR 62. Nup358 depletion also significantly impaired miR&#8208;30a activity (Fig 2C). Additionally, Nup358 was required for let&#8208;7&#8208;mediated suppression of FL mRNAs engineered to contain the 3&#8242;&#8208;UTR of HMGA2 that harbors multiple functional let&#8208;7 binding sites (Fig 2D) 63. Moreover, knockdown of Nup358 using three independent siRNAs targeted to different regions of Nup358 gene led to significant de&#8208;repression of RL&#8208;3xBulge reporter mRNA (Fig EV2A). When different concentrations of siRNAs were used to deplete Nup358 to varying levels, the de&#8208;repression occurred in a dose&#8208;dependent manner (Fig EV2B). Ectopic expression of GFP&#8208;Nup358 in HeLa cells enhanced miR&#8208;30&#8208;mediated suppression of FL&#8208;reporter mRNA as compared to GFP&#8208;control (Fig EV2C). Moreover, exogenous expression of Nup358 also rescued the de&#8208;repression caused by Nup358 knockdown (Fig EV2D). Taken together, these results suggested that Nup358 plays an important role in miRNA pathway.</text>

      <text>To test whether Nup358 knockdown affected pre&#8208;miRNA export and/or maturation, we measured the levels of mature miRNAs using different methods. Northern blot analysis with specific 32P radiolabeled miRNA probe indicated that Nup358 depletion did not grossly affect the levels of mature let&#8208;7a miRNA in HeLa (Fig 3A, upper panel). As expected, we observed a reduction in the level of mature let&#8208;7a in Dicer&#8208;depleted cells in comparison with control siRNA&#8208;treated cells. These Northern blot results were further confirmed by a TaqMan&#8208;based real&#8208;time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay (Fig 3A, lower panel). We also performed deep sequencing of small RNAs and assessed the relative levels of miRNAs between control and Nup358&#8208;depleted HEK293T cells. The results indicated that out of 629 miRNAs commonly detected in control and Nup358 knockdown cells, 494 miRNAs (~78%) showed no significant change in the level of their expression. Among the remaining miRNAs analyzed, ~10% were downregulated and ~12% were upregulated in Nup358&#8208;depleted cells as compared to control cells. The relative levels of 50 most abundant miRNAs in HEK293T cells under control and Nup358 knockdown conditions are shown in Fig EV3A. Collectively, these results suggested that Nup358 does not play any significant role in miRNA biogenesis.</text>

Towards addressing this, AGO2 immunoprecipitation was performed in control or Nup358 siRNA&#8208;treated cells, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed for the presence of specific miRNAs by qPCR. Two abundant miRNAs in HeLa cells (let&#8208;7a and miR&#8208;17) showed no significant difference in the extent of their association with AGO2 in the absence or presence of Nup358 (Fig 3B).

      <text>We next investigated whether Nup358 depletion caused any effect on the interaction of target mRNA with the miRISC. To test this, we immunoprecipitated endogenous AGO2 from HeLa cells and examined for the presence of RL&#8208;3xBulge mRNA (a miRNA target that has three imperfect let&#8208;7a binding sites) using qPCR. Similar to Dicer&#8208; and AGO2&#8208;depleted conditions, Nup358 knockdown significantly impaired the ability of miRISC to associate with the RL&#8208;3xBulge target mRNA (Fig 3B). Furthermore, we analyzed the association of two validated endogenous mRNA targets with AGO2 63, in the absence and presence of Nup358. In Nup358&#8208;depleted cells, binding of AGO2 to Serbp1 and Dnajb11 mRNAs was significantly reduced as compared to that of GAPDH mRNA (Fig 3C). Consistent with a role for Nup358 in miRNA pathway, the protein levels of established miRNA targets such as Ras 64 and c&#8208;Myc 65, 66 were found to be increased in Nup358&#8208;depleted cells (Fig 3D).

      <text>To verify this further, we utilized a previously reported artificial AGO2 tethering assay that bypasses the requirement of miRNA for suppression of the target mRNA 67. The suppression of AGO2&#8208;tethered mRNA, however, is dependent on GW182 and downstream effectors 68. We reasoned that if Nup358 plays a role in the coupling of miRNA with target mRNA, it should be dispensable in a condition where suppression of target mRNA occurs independent of miRNA. Our results showed that Nup358 depletion did not have a specific effect on the ability of tethered AGO2 to suppress the reporter RNA (Fig EV4). This outcome is consistent with the finding that Nup358 is essential for association of target mRNA with miRISC, but is not required once the target mRNA is directly made to interact with the AGO protein. The results also suggested that Nup358 depletion does not cause any general effect on miRNA pathway downstream to miRNA&#8211;mRNA association.</text>

      <text>Our results suggested that Nup358 could play a role in the coupling of target mRNA with miRISC. Human Nup358 contains eight ZnF domains in the middle region (Fig EV5A), and previous studies have shown these domains to directly bind the signal sequence coding regions present in a subset of mRNAs encoding secretory proteins 69. Also, RanBP2&#8208;type ZnF domains are shown to be present in some RNA binding proteins and contribute to RNA binding 70. We were interested to examine whether ZnF domains are required for Nup358's function in mRNA&#8211;miRISC coupling process. Toward this, let&#8208;7a miRNA activity was monitored using reporter assays in Nup358&#8208;depleted HeLa cells after expressing a Nup358 deletion mutant that was devoid of ZnF domains. The results showed that the mutant protein was capable of almost completely rescuing the de&#8208;repression caused by Nup358 depletion (Fig EV5B), supporting the conclusion that the RNA&#8208;binding ZnF domains are dispensable for Nup358's function in miRNA pathway.</text>

      <text>Based on the finding that Nup358 functions in coupling the target mRNA to miRISC, we tested whether Nup358 interacts with components of miRISC. We immunoprecipitated endogenous Nup358 from HeLa cells and analyzed the immunoprecipitate for the presence of AGO2 and GW182. The co&#8208;immunoprecipitation assay suggested that Nup358 associated with both AGO2 and GW182 in vivo (Fig 3E). This interaction was found to be independent of RNA, as RNase A treatment did not alter the association of Nup358 with AGO2 or GW182 considerably (Fig 3E). Under the same condition, as previously shown, the interaction of AGO2 with PABPC1 was found to be RNA&#8208;dependent 63 (Fig 3E).</text>

HeLa cells were transfected with RL&#8208;3xBulge (let&#8208;7a target), and RNA&#8211;protein cross&#8208;linking was performed using formaldehyde. The cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using IgG control or Nup358&#8208;specific antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed for the presence of let&#8208;7a by qPCR. As compared to IgG control, Nup358 immunoprecipitate had significantly higher levels of let&#8208;7a miRNA (Fig 3F). Moreover, the ectopically expressed (RL&#8208;3xBulge) and endogenous (Dnajb11) mRNA targets were also enriched in Nup358 immunoprecipitate (Fig 3F). Collectively, these results suggested that Nup358 associates with the protein and RNA components of the miRNA&#8208;induced silencing complex in vivo.</text>

      <text>Nup358 is a large nucleoporin with multiple domains (Fig 4A). We wished to characterize the interaction between Nup358 and AGO proteins in detail. To delineate the region in Nup358 that is involved in the interaction with AGO, GFP&#8208;tagged N&#8208;terminal (Nup358&#8208;N), middle (Nup358&#8208;M), or C&#8208;terminal region (Nup358&#8208;C) of Nup358 was expressed along with HA&#8208;AGO2 in HEK293T cells. Co&#8208;immunoprecipitation assays revealed that AGO2 specifically interacted with all three fragments of Nup358, and more prominently with the C&#8208;terminal fragment (Fig 4B). Further, we proceeded to identify and characterize the minimum region in Nup358&#8208;C required for interaction with AGO2. Experiments with deletion constructs of Nup358&#8208;C indicated that the IR region was sufficient to mediate the interaction with AGO2 (Fig 4C). Consistent with this, a deletion mutant of Nup358&#8208;C lacking the IR region failed to interact with AGO2 (Fig 4D).</text>

      <text>As the results suggested that IR region of Nup358 is involved in binding to AGO proteins, we investigated this molecular interaction in detail. Nup358&#8208;IR possesses two internal repeats, each of them having a SIM&#8208;binding and a Ubc9&#8208;binding region (Fig 5A) 50. Interestingly, we found that both IR1 and IR2 could independently interact with AGO2 in a SIM&#8208;dependent manner (Fig 5B). However, as known earlier, IR1, and not IR2, specifically interacted with endogenous SUMOylated RanGAP and Ubc9 50, 51. Also, deletion of SIM1 from IR1 abrogated the interaction with SUMO~RanGAP, but not with Ubc9 (Fig 5B). To test whether SIM is sufficient for AGO interaction, we co&#8208;expressed HA&#8208;AGO2 with GFP&#8208;SIM1 or GFP&#8208;SIM2. Co&#8208;immunoprecipitation assay clearly indicated that SIM1 and SIM2 independently were capable of interacting with AGO2, but not with SUMO~RanGAP or Ubc9 (Fig 5C).</text>

      <text>It has been shown previously that Ubc9 preferably binds to IR1 and stabilizes the interaction between IR1 and SUMO~RanGAP 50, 51. We wished to test whether Ubc9 is required for the interaction between IR (IR1 + 2) and AGO2. Interestingly, a mutant of IR that is defective in binding to Ubc9 (IR1 + 2L2651A,L2653A) 37 still efficiently associated with AGO2, whereas as expected, it failed to interact with SUMO~RanGAP (Fig 5D). Moreover, deletion of SIM1, but not SIM2, from IR disrupted its interaction with AGO2, indicating that in the context of intact IR, AGO2 interaction is mainly dependent on SIM1 (Fig 5E). As expected, SIM1 deletion also impaired the ability of IR to associate with SUMO~RanGAP, and not with Ubc9 (Fig 5E). Taken together, these results suggested that AGO&#8208;IR interaction requires neither Ubc9 nor SUMO~RanGAP, and SIM is the minimum region in Nup358 required for the interaction with AGO2.</text>

      <text>Earlier studies indicated that within Nup358&#8208;SIM1, the hydrophobic amino acids V2632, I2634, and L2635 contribute to SUMO binding 48. We found that substituting these residues with alanine compromised the SIM's ability to bind AGO protein (Fig 6A), indicating that the binding mode of SIM with SUMO and AGO proteins could be similar. The finding that both SIM1 and SIM2 from Nup358&#8208;IR independently interacted with AGO2 prompted us to investigate whether SIMs derived from other SUMO&#8208;interacting proteins are capable of binding to AGO. Toward this, GFP&#8208;fused SIMs from PIAS1 and TTRAP (Fig 6B) were individually co&#8208;expressed with HA&#8208;AGO2 in HEK293T cells and assessed for their ability to interact with AGO2 by co&#8208;immunoprecipitation assays. It has already been shown that PIAS1&#8208;SIM interacts with both SUMO1 and SUMO2, whereas TTRAP&#8208;SIM shows greater preference for SUMO2 43. We found that irrespective of the proteins from which they were derived, both the SIMs interacted with AGO2 (Fig 6B). Moreover, SIM could associate with both AGO1 and AGO2 (Fig 6C). Collectively, these results indicated that SIM provides a binding platform for conserved interaction with AGO subfamily of proteins.</text>

      <text>The finding that AGO proteins bind to SIM raised the possibility that AGO has SUMO&#8208;like domains found to be present in a few proteins 72, 73. However, analysis suggested that such domains are absent in AGO proteins. The other possibility included that there could be regions in AGO proteins that are structurally similar to the regions in SUMO that are involved in interaction with SIM 74. Using a recently developed algorithm, CLICK, probable regions on AGO2 were recognized by structural similarity to the SUMO regions that interact with SIM 75, 76. This structural analysis identified three distinct regions on AGO2 (Fig 6F). The structures of SUMO and AGO2 in the superimposed regions were between 70 and 87% geometrically similar with RMSD values ranging from 1.6 to 1.9 &#197;. The predicted binding sites comprised amino acids belonging to the N, MID, and PIWI domains of AGO2. These analyses point to the presence of multiple putative SIM&#8208;binding sites in AGO proteins.</text>

      <text>Artificial tethering of AGO proteins to the 3&#8242;&#8208;UTR of reporter mRNA has been shown to suppress the reporter mRNA 67. We wished to test whether Nup358&#8208;IR could be tethered to mRNAs to suppress their expression, presumably by recruiting AGO proteins. As we found that IR1 + 2 mutant (IR1 + 2L2651A,L2653A) was incapable of binding to endogenous SUMO~RanGAP or Ubc9, but retained the ability to bind to AGO proteins (Fig 5D), we used this mutant in tethering studies. HEK293T cells were transfected with N&#955;&#8208;peptide&#8208;HA&#8208;tagged IR1 + 2L2651A,L2653A (N&#8208;HA&#8208;IR1 + 2L2651A,L2653A) along with a reporter construct engineered to express the Renilla luciferase mRNA with five BoxB hairpins at its 3&#8242;&#8208;UTR, which provides binding site for N&#8208;HA&#8208;tagged proteins 67. In addition to N&#8208;HA&#8208;MBP, HA&#8208;IR1 + 2L2651A,L2653A that is incapable of binding to BoxB hairpin was used as control. The results from tethering assays clearly suggested that N&#8208;HA&#8208;IR1 + 2L2651A,L2653A could significantly suppress the expression of the reporter mRNA (Fig 7B). Collectively, these results support the notion that IR region, and particularly SIM, acts functionally as an AGO&#8208;interacting motif.</text>

      <text>Previous studies have suggested that P bodies are the sites at which miRNA&#8208;mediated suppression/degradation of the target mRNA could occur 5, 6. However, other studies indicated that microscopically visible P body formation is a consequence of miRNA&#8208;mediated repression 60. Therefore, it may be possible that Nup358 participates in miRNA pathway by playing a role at the level of formation and/or functioning of P bodies. Interestingly, exogenous expression of HA&#8208;AGO2, but not HA&#8208;MBP control, restored P body formation in Nup358&#8208;depleted cells to a level almost comparable to that in the control siRNA&#8208;treated cells (Fig 7C). Next, we tested whether ectopic expression of AGO2 is sufficient to revert back the miRNA&#8208;mediated de&#8208;repression caused by Nup358 depletion. HeLa cells were treated with control or Nup358&#8208;specific siRNA and subsequently assessed for let&#8208;7&#8208;mediated repression of the RL&#8208;3xBulge reporter mRNA in the presence of ectopically expressed HA&#8208;MBP (control) or HA&#8208;AGO2. Interestingly, expression of AGO2 did not rescue the impairment of miRNA pathway caused by Nup358 knockdown (Fig 7C). Collectively, this suggested that restoration of P body assembly in Nup358&#8208;depleted cells was not sufficient to rescue the miRNA&#8208;mediated suppression defect. Although the mechanism by which AGO2 expression induced P body formation in Nup358 knockdown cells is not clear, the results supported a functional role for Nup358 in miRNA pathway upstream to P body assembly.</text>

      <text>Previously, it has been shown that miRNA&#8208;loaded AGO2 localizes to the rough ER 11. To investigate whether Nup358 plays a role in targeting AGO2 to the rER, membrane flotation assay was performed using cells that were treated with control or Nup358 siRNA. The fractionation was verified by using PDI (ER lumen marker), RPL7a (ribosome marker), and LAMP2 (lysosome marker). The results suggested that Nup358 depletion did not affect the overall localization of AGO2 to rER (Fig 7D), indicating that it may not function in targeting AGO proteins to the ER.</text>

      <text>Based on the data presented here, we propose the following model (Fig 7E). Exported mRNAs could be sorted at the NE (NPC) and at the ER (AL) for determination of their eventual fate in the cytoplasm. Nup358, as a component of NPC and AL, is involved in the coupling of target mRNA with miRISC to bring about miRNA&#8208;mediated suppression. We propose that Nup358 could essentially exert its function both at the NE and ER. The findings thereby also indicate a specific role of ER in coordinating the cytoplasmic events involved in miRNA&#8208;mediated gene silencing pathway.</text>

      <text>Here, we show that Nup358 plays an important role in miRNA&#8208;mediated translational suppression, by aiding in the coupling of target mRNA with miRISC in vivo. Consistent with this function, we find that Nup358 physically interacts with the protein and RNA components of the miRNA&#8208;induced silencing complex. Further characterization of Nup358&#8211;AGO interaction revealed the previously characterized SIM as a conserved motif for interaction with AGO family of proteins as well. The functional and evolutionary significance of the finding that the same motif performs binding to AGO and SUMO proteins deserves further investigation. Furthermore, our results with tethering and dominant&#8208;negative experiments support the idea that SIM&#8208;mediated interaction of Nup358 with AGO proteins is important for miRNA function.</text>

      <text>Where does the coupling of miRISC with target mRNA occur? Recent studies indicated a role for ER in this process 10, 11. Our live imaging studies clearly show an intimate interaction of mRNP granules such as P bodies and SGs with cytoplasmic AL and NE. We also found that some of the AL could originate from the NE. Although untested, it is possible that AL could carry mRNAs into the cytoplasm, where the fate of these mRNAs could be regulated. The results reported here point to a potential role of AL as platforms for the regulation of exported and/or cytoplasmic mRNAs by coordinating with machineries involved in mRNA remodeling in the cytoplasm. Although a robust, dynamic association of cytoplasmic AL with the mRNP granules was evident from our live imaging studies, we are unsure whether the coupling occurs only at the AL. Further studies are required to delineate the contribution of NPC&#8208; and AL&#8208;associated Nup358 in this process. Understanding the mechanistic details by which Nup358 gets targeted to these structures would help address this question conclusively.</text>

      <text>Interestingly, exogenous expression of AGO2 could almost completely restore P body formation in Nup358&#8208;deficient cells, but failed to rescue the impaired miRNA function (Fig 7C), arguing against an indirect role for Nup358 in miRNA pathway through maintenance of P body integrity. These data strengthen the conclusion that Nup358 plays a role in the coupling of mRNA target with miRISC, and P body disruption observed in Nup358&#8208;depleted cells could be a consequence of impaired miRNA function. Furthermore, the observation that overexpression of Nup358 enhances miRNA function (Fig EV2C and D) indicates it to be a rate&#8208;limiting factor regulating miRNA pathway in mammalian cells.</text>

      <text>Whether Nup358&#8211;AGO2 interaction increases the quantitative efficiency of AGO2 to associate with the target mRNA through compartmentalization or it affects miRISC&#8211;mRNA interaction at the molecular level is unclear. This interaction, however, does not seem to be essential for targeting the miRNA&#8208;loaded AGO2 to the rER (Fig 7D). It is possible that Nup358 acts as a scaffold for mediating the coupling of the target RNA with the miRISC in the context of rER. This could involve interaction of Nup358 with target RNA as well as with the miRISC components AGO and GW182. Interestingly, we have observed that depletion of Nup358 affects target RNA suppression mediated by of miRNA (Fig 2B&#8211;D) and not when AGO2 is artificially tethered to the target RNA (Fig EV4). How does Nup358 participate in the coupling of mRNA with AGO protein (or miRISC) only in case of miRNA&#8208;mediated suppression? One of the possibilities is that Nup358&#8211;AGO interaction is required for a conformational change in AGO protein that favors its binding to target RNA and/or facilitates the miRNA&#8211;mRNA base pairing within the RNA&#8208;binding groove. The extensive interaction between Nup358 and AGO would help achieve this.</text>

      <text>A recent study suggested that Nup358 is important for translational activation of a set of mRNAs encoding secretory proteins 69. The authors have shown that Nup358 interacts with mRNAs through the ZnF domains and potentiates their translation. However, the ZnF domains appear to be dispensable for the Nup358's function in miRNA pathway. Combined with the earlier report, our results suggest that Nup358 might play a general role in determining the cytoplasmic fate of mRNAs (translational activation or suppression), possibly involving different mechanisms.</text>

      <text>Our findings show that SUMO~RanGAP interacts with the same region (SIM1) to which AGO also binds. Association of SUMO~RanGAP with the IR region could be competed with increasing levels of AGO2 in cells, indicating that the binding of AGO and SUMO~RanGAP is mutually exclusive (Appendix Fig S2). However, the binding of SUMO~RanGAP and Ubc9 with IR appears to be rather stronger and AGO2 does not completely compete out this interaction. Understanding the functional relevance of mutually exclusive Nup358 complexes, containing either SUMO~RanGAP or AGO proteins, requires further investigation. This could spatially and temporally regulate aspects of Nup358 function within the cell. Intriguingly, the binding of AGO proteins to IR region might influence RanGAP's function and Nup358's SUMO E3 ligase activity.</text>

      <text>Previous studies have shown that human AGO2 gets SUMOylated at lysine 402 77, 78. Consistent with this, we also found that the lysine residue 402, but not 266 or 693, of human AGO2 is modified by SUMO (Appendix Fig S3A). Interestingly, similar to wild type, SUMO&#8208;defective mutant (K402R) of AGO2 retained the ability to associate with IR region (Appendix Fig S3B), indicating that the binding of AGO2 to SIM is not dependent on SUMO modification. Moreover, we noticed that unmodified AGO is capable of binding to IR/SIM as revealed by our co&#8208;immunoprecipitation assays.</text>

      <text>Does AGO bind to IR/SIM as a potential substrate for SUMO modification? We believe it to be unlikely because of the following reasons. Firstly, previous studies have shown that IR acts as an E3 ligase by not directly binding to the substrate, rather binding to SUMO~Ubc9 thioester to enhance the Ubc9 (E2) activity for SUMOylation 47, 53. Secondly, among the four AGO subclade members, only AGO1 and AGO2 have the conserved lysine residue (K402 in AGO2) that undergoes SUMOylation 78. In spite of this, we found all AGO proteins to have the ability to efficiently bind to IR. Thirdly, binding of SIM to SUMO (as a part of SUMO~Ubc9 thioester) is required for the IR to act as an E3 ligase 50, 79, and due to the mutually exclusive nature of interaction between SUMO and AGO with SIM, AGO binding to the SIM would in principle affect IR's E3 ligase activity.</text>

For example, many germ cell RNP granules are present in the perinuclear region, often adjacent to NE or NPCs, and genome&#8208;wide screenings have identified some nucleoporins in having roles in the assembly and function of these structures 80, 81, 82, 83. The physical proximity of these RNP granules to NE or NPCs could also help coupling the exported RNAs to machineries involved in RNA regulation in the cytoplasm.</text>

      <text>Is the AL&#8208;RNP granule association conserved across evolution? In earlier studies, AL are shown to associate with MEX&#8208;3&#8208;positive RNP granules in the arrested C. elegans oocytes 21. Interestingly, depletion of npp&#8208;9, the Nup358 homolog in C. elegans, led to disruption of MEX&#8208;3 granules, indicating a role for this nucleoporin in the mRNP assembly 21. In another study, it was shown that P granules in C. elegans are present in the perinuclear region, often adjacent to NPC clusters enriched in npp&#8208;9 84. This nuclear association was implicated to play a role in collection of mRNAs by P granule components prior to their release into the cytoplasm. The nucleoporin npp&#8208;9 also was shown to physically interact with P granules that were released into the cytoplasm 84. However, the functional role of npp&#8208;9 in this context is currently unknown and requires further investigation.</text>

Further studies on the interaction between Nup358 and AGO proteins revealed that the previously characterized SUMO interaction motif acts as a binding motif for AGO family of proteins as well. These findings provide a framework not only for exploring the mechanistic details of how Nup358 functions in miRNA pathway, but also to understand the role of ER (AL) in miRNA&#8208;mediated suppression.</text>

For in vitro interactions, pMAL&#8208;AGO2 was generated by cloning the BamH1 fragment having AGO2 ORF from pCMV&#8208;SPORT&#8208;hAGO2 into pMAL&#8208;c2 (New England Biolabs). To generate GST&#8208;SIM1, Nup358&#8208;SIM1 oligos were annealed and cloned into EcoRI/XhoI sites of pGEX&#8208;6P1 vector (GE healthcare). HA&#8208;AGO2 mutants&#8212;K693R, K402R, and K266R&#8212;were generated by PCR&#8208;based method using pcDNA&#8208;HA&#8208;AGO2 as a template and verified by sequencing. pEGFP&#8208;SUMO1G and pEGFP&#8208;SUMO1GG were generated by PCR&#8208;amplifying the SUMO ORF using specific primers and subcloning into pEGFP&#8208;C1 (Clontech) at KpnI and SmaI sites.</text>

      <text>For immunofluorescence analysis, cells grown on coverslips were fixed using chilled methanol for 5 min. Cells were quickly washed with 0.1% Triton X&#8208;100 in Tris&#8208;buffered saline (TBS) and then incubated with indicated primary antibodies diluted in TBS containing 2% normal horse serum (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature (RT). Cells were washed three times with TBS, followed by addition of fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies and incubation for 30 min at RT. Hoechst 33342 dye (Sigma) was used to stain the DNA, which was added to the secondary antibody solution. Cells were again washed three times with TBS, and the coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). To avoid dehydration, coverslips were sealed using nail polish, and were later observed under microscope. Images were captured with Leica TCS SP5 or Zeiss 510 Meta laser&#8208;scanning confocal microscope using a Plan Apochromat 63&#215;/1.4 NA oil immersion objective. Images were processed further in Adobe Photoshop CS2. The microscope has been regularly calibrated for alignment/chromatic aberration between two channels, as evident from the intensity profiles obtained using TetraSpeck beads (Appendix Fig S4).</text>

      <text>For co&#8208;immunoprecipitation of AGO2 and GW182 with Nup358, HeLa cells were washed with ice&#8208;cold TBS, scrapped using a cell scrapper, and resuspended in chilled lysis buffer (25 mM Tris&#8211;HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 0.5% NP&#8208;40, 2 mM EDTA) supplemented with 7.5 mM NaF, 0.75 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM PMSF, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), leupeptin 50 &#956;g/ml, aprotinin 5 &#956;g/ml, and pepstatin 2 &#956;g/ml. To make a clear lysate, mild sonication was given (three pulses at 30% amplitude) and repeated 3&#8211;4 times depending upon the initial cell volume. Lysate was centrifuged in Eppendorf centrifuge (5417 R) to remove cellular debris at &#8764;10,600 g for 10 min at 4&#176;C and was further pre&#8208;cleared by incubating with protein A&#8211;Sepharose beads (Invitrogen). Starting material was prepared by mixing 1/10th volume of the pre&#8208;cleared lysate with equal volume 3&#215; SDS&#8211;PAGE loading dye and heated at 95&#176;C for 5 min. In the meantime, protein A&#8211;Sepharose beads were bound with indicated antibodies by incubating in TBS for 1 h 30 min at 4&#176;C on a rotospin (Bangalore Genei). Antibody&#8208;bound beads were then washed with lysis buffer twice, and the pre&#8208;cleared lysate was incubated for 2 h at 4&#176;C on rotospin. The immunoprecipitates were then washed with lysis buffer twice, followed by a final wash with TBS before eluting in SDS&#8211;PAGE loading dye. The immunoprecipitates were separated on SDS&#8211;PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore) using semi&#8208;dry transfer apparatus (Bio&#8208;Rad or GE). For Western blotting, PVDF membranes were incubated with primary antibody in 1% BSA in TBS with 0.1% Tween&#8208;20 (TBST) for 2 h at RT or overnight at 4&#176;C. Membranes were washed thrice with TBST for 3 min each and incubated with HRP&#8208;conjugated secondary antibodies in 1% BSA in TBST for 1 h. Membranes were washed thrice with TBST and developed using ECL Plus Western Detection Kit (GE Healthcare or Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturer's instructions. The images were acquired using ImageQuant LAS 4000 (GE Healthcare). EZview&#8482; Red Anti&#8208;HA Affinity beads (Sigma) and rabbit GFP antibody 86&#8208;bound protein A beads (Invitrogen) were used for immunoprecipitation of HA&#8208; and GFP&#8208;tagged proteins, respectively.</text>

Further, cells were transfected with RL&#8208;3xBulge construct and incubated for 24 h. For RNA immunoprecipitation analysis, cells were washed with ice&#8208;cold 1&#215; PBS, removed using a cell scrapper, and resuspended in chilled NET2 buffer (100 mM Tris&#8211;HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% NP&#8208;40) supplemented with 7.5 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, PIC (Roche), and 100 U/ml of murine RNase inhibitor. To make a clear lysate, mild sonication was given, three pulses at 30% amplitude, and repeated thrice. Lysate was centrifuged to clear cellular debris at &#8764;15,200 g for 10 min at 4&#176;C. Lysate was further pre&#8208;cleared by incubating the supernatant with protein G&#8211;Sepharose beads (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 4&#176;C. A part of the pre&#8208;cleared lysate was taken out as starting material for RNA isolation and Western analysis. For AGO2 immunoprecipitation, mouse anti&#8208;AGO2 (Sigma, WH0027161M1) or rat anti&#8208;AGO2 (Sigma, SAB4200085) antibodies were used. Mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories) and rat IgG (BD Pharmingen) were used as respective control IgGs. In the meantime, tRNA&#8208;saturated beads were prepared by incubating protein A&#8211;Sepharose beads with yeast tRNA (Invitrogen), herring sperm DNA (Sigma), and glycogen (Sigma) in NET2 buffer for 90 min at 4&#176;C. Finally, tRNA&#8208;saturated beads were incubated with the lysate containing antibodies and incubated for 1 h at 4&#176;C. Beads were then washed 5&#8211;7 times with NET2 buffer and the RNA was isolated from beads using TRIzol as mentioned earlier, except that the RNA precipitation was performed for 4 h at &#8722;20&#176;C. RNA samples were further used for cDNA synthesis, followed by real&#8208;time PCR analysis as described below.</text>

      <text>For analyzing the association of miRNA and mRNA with Nup358, HeLa cells were transfected with the miRNA reporter construct RL&#8208;3xBulge. Twenty hours post&#8208;transfection, cells were washed thrice with PBS and then cross&#8208;linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. Glycine was added to a final concentration of 0.25 M for neutralization for 5 min. The cells were washed with PBS three times and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP&#8208;40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing PIC (Roche) and 100 U/ml of murine RNase inhibitor). Following a mild sonication, the lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was then incubated with rabbit IgG (control) or Nup358&#8208;specific antibodies for 45 min at 4&#176;C. In the meanwhile, protein A&#8211;Sepharose beads were coated with herring serum DNA, tRNA, and glycogen for 30 min. The lysate was then incubated with coated beads for 45 min at 4&#176;C. The immunoprecipitate was given five washes with RIPA buffer containing 1 M NaCl. Delinking was done with 1% SDS, 10 mM DTT, 5 mM EDTA, and 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, for 1 h at 70&#176;C, followed by proteinase K treatment (10 &#956;g/ml) for 45 min at 55&#176;C. RNA was isolated using TRIzol method as mentioned above, and RNA precipitation was done overnight in the presence of glycogen. cDNA synthesis for miRNA and mRNA and the respective qPCRs were done using the protocols mentioned below.</text>

      <text>HeLa cells seeded on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1&#215; TBS for 15 min at RT. Chilled methanol was added to the cells and incubated for 5 min. This was followed by incubation of the coverslips with 2&#215; SSC at RT for 10 min. Further, hybridization chamber was used to carry out the hybridization process. In the process, moistened strips of filter paper were kept on the edges of the stage to avoid the coverslips from drying out. The hybridization mix was made up of the following components: 40% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 0.1 mg herring sperm DNA, and 5 ng/&#956;l of FAM oligo(dT) in a 2&#215; SSC solution. One hundred microliters of the hybridization mix was added per coverslip. Hybridization was carried out at 37&#176;C for 3 h. Further, the coverslips were washed twice with 2&#215; SSC followed by one wash with 0.2&#215; SSC. Followed by three washes with 1&#215; TBS, the cells were incubated with Hoechst 33342 diluted in 1&#215; TBS. Cells were then washed with 1&#215; TBS and coverslips were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and observed under microscope.</text>

      <text>Membrane flotation assay was carried out as described earlier 11, 87. Briefly, 6 &#215; 106 HeLa cells were seeded in each 60&#8208;mm dish. Twelve hours later, cells were transfected with 40 nM of control or Nup358 siRNA for 72 h. Cells in each dish were washed twice with ice&#8208;cold 1&#215; PBS and lysed in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer [10 mM Tris, pH 8, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, and EDTA&#8208;free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)] by passing through a 23&#8208;gauge needle 15 times. Lysates were centrifuged at 1,000 g for 5 min at 4&#176;C. The resultant post&#8208;nuclear supernatant (446 &#956;l) was mixed with 72% (w/v) sucrose made in hypotonic buffer (1.78 ml) and overlaid with 55% (w/v) sucrose (2.23 ml), followed by 0.54 ml of 10% (w/v) sucrose (0.54 ml). Ultracentrifugation was performed at 140,000 g (4&#176;C) using MLS&#8208;50 rotor for 12 h. After centrifugation, 1&#8208;ml fractions were collected from top of the gradient. To each fraction, 5 ml of hypotonic buffer was initially added and mixed, followed by 1.5 ml of 100% TCA. Proteins were precipitated by centrifugation at 1,400 g (4&#176;C) for 5 min. The protein pellets were washed four times with ice&#8208;cold acetone and air&#8208;dried before resuspending in 25 &#956;l of NP&#8208;40 lysis buffer. After addition of 25 &#956;l of 3&#215; SDS loading dye, the samples were heated at 95&#176;C for 5 min and subjected to SDS&#8211;PAGE for Western analysis.</text>

      <text>HEK293T cells were transfected with control or Nup358 shRNA. Total RNA was isolated and miRNA deep sequencing was performed at Genotypic Technology, Bengaluru, India. Small RNA libraries for sequencing were constructed according to the Illumina TruSeq Small RNA preparation Guide. One microgram of total RNA was used as the starting material. Briefly, 3&#8242; adaptors were ligated to the specific 3&#8242;OH group of small RNAs followed by 5&#8242; adaptor ligation. The ligated products were reverse&#8208;transcribed with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. The cDNA was enriched by PCR and cleaned using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The library was size selected in the range of 140&#8211;180 bp followed by overnight gel elution and precipitation using glycogen, 3 M sodium acetate, and absolute ethanol. The precipitate was resuspended in resuspension buffer. The prepared library was quantified using Nanodrop and Qubit Fluorometer and validated for quality by running an aliquot on High Sensitivity Bioanalyzer Chip (Agilent). The libraries were sequenced for 54SE small RNA sequencing in GAIIX (Illumina). The relative expression of miRNAs was analyzed by GeneSpring NGS software. The values were log&#8208;transformed and the heatmap was generated using Matplotlib. The corresponding fold change has been represented by bar graphs.</text>

      <text>To identify possible Nup358 binding sites on AGO2, we compared the 3D structure of AGO2 (PDB ID: 4W5O) 88 with that of SUMO (PDB ID: 1Z5S) 47. The chosen SUMO structure was in complex with the SIM1 of Nup358. Structural superimpositions were performed using the CLICK program 75, 76 that identifies similar sub&#8208;structures regardless of topology. All superimpositions were carried out with full&#8208;length AGO2 and a truncated SUMO molecule comprising the residues 20&#8211;54 and 86&#8211;91. These regions on SUMO consisted of regular secondary structures that were most proximal to the bound Nup358. On superimposing the AGO2 with SUMO structures, the position of the Nup358 was transferred onto the former. Of the 93 different superimpositions obtained, 46 cases had collisions between Nup358&#8208;SIM1 and the AGO2 molecule. Therefore, these superimpositions were deemed unphysical and omitted from further consideration. The remaining 47 alignments were clustered by spatial proximity to one another, and one structure was chosen to represent each cluster (Fig 6F).</text>
