      <text>Cellular transitions require dramatic changes in gene expression that are supported by regulated mRNA decay and new transcription. The maternal&#8208;to&#8208;zygotic transition is a conserved developmental progression during which thousands of maternal mRNAs are cleared by post&#8208;transcriptional mechanisms. Although some maternal mRNAs are targeted for degradation by microRNAs, this pathway does not fully explain mRNA clearance. We investigated how codon identity and translation affect mRNA stability during development and homeostasis. We show that the codon triplet contains translation&#8208;dependent regulatory information that influences transcript decay. Codon composition shapes maternal mRNA clearance during the maternal&#8208;to&#8208;zygotic transition in zebrafish, Xenopus, mouse, and Drosophila, and gene expression during homeostasis across human tissues. Some synonymous codons show consistent stabilizing or destabilizing effects, suggesting that amino acid composition influences mRNA stability. Codon composition affects both polyadenylation status and translation efficiency. Thus, the ribosome interprets two codes within the mRNA: the genetic code which specifies the amino acid sequence and a conserved &#8220;codon optimality code&#8221; that&#160;shapes mRNA stability and translation efficiency across vertebrates.</text>

      <text>During biological transitions, cells install a new transcriptional program while removing the previous program. This process depends on the post&#8208;transcriptional control of persistent transcripts as new mRNAs are transcribed. In early embryonic development, maternally deposited mRNAs and proteins govern the embryonic development of most animals until the zygotic genome is activated (Tadros &amp; Lipshitz, 2009; Yartseva &amp; Giraldez, 2015). Following egg activation and fertilization, the embryo initiates the maternal&#8208;to&#8208;zygotic transition (MZT). During this universal transition, the transcriptome undergoes a drastic remodeling resulting in the clearance of thousands of maternal mRNAs and activation of the zygotic genome. 3&#8242;UTRs regulate mRNA stability across different biological processes (Giraldez et&#160;al, 2006; Bushati et&#160;al, 2008; Bartel, 2009; Lund et&#160;al, 2009; Rice, 2015; Rusek et&#160;al, 2015). For example, conserved microRNA families (miR&#8208;430/&#8208;427 and miR&#8208;309) are responsible for the degradation of a subset of maternal mRNAs in zebrafish (Giraldez et&#160;al, 2006), Xenopus (Lund et&#160;al, 2009), and Drosophila (Bushati et&#160;al, 2008), respectively. Similarly, in Drosophila, the RNA binding protein SMAUG functions to destabilize maternal mRNAs (Tadros et&#160;al, 2007). Despite the identification of these factors, thousands of maternal mRNAs are cleared by unknown mechanisms (Tadros &amp; Lipshitz, 2009; Yartseva &amp; Giraldez, 2015). While most of the factors identified are conserved and regulate mRNA stability through the 3&#8242;UTR, the role of the coding sequence (CDS) in regulating transcript stability during the MZT transition and tissue homeostasis across animals is largely unexplored (Richter &amp; Coller, 2015; Yartseva &amp; Giraldez, 2015; Mishima &amp; Tomari, 2016).</text>

      <text>The ribosome represents the most abundant RNA binding complex in the cell (Doudna &amp; Rath, 2002), translating mRNA sequences into amino acids. Translation is also important for quality control mechanisms (Shoemaker &amp; Green, 2012; Pechmann et&#160;al, 2013), such as nonsense&#8208;mediated decay (NMD), no&#8208;go decay (NGD), and nonstop decay (NSD), which surveil translation to regulate defective transcripts. Recently, specific codons have been associated with transcript stability (optimal codons) or instability (non&#8208;optimal codons) in bacteria and yeast (Presnyak et&#160;al, 2015; Boel et&#160;al, 2016). The degeneracy of the genetic code allows multiple codons to encode for the same amino acid (Gamow, 1954), and silent codon substitutions can influence protein expression (Ikemura, 1982; Kudla et&#160;al, 2009). While codon usage bias exists across all domains of life (Novoa &amp; Ribas de Pouplana, 2012), the evolutionary pressures exerted by the codon usage on gene expression and growth are distinct between unicellular and multicellular systems. Thus, it is unclear whether codon identity regulates mRNA stability across vertebrates, and if so, what is the identity of the codons conferring regulation, the conservation of the regulatory code, and the biological implications of this mechanism across animals. Interestingly, during the review process of this manuscript, it has been shown that differential use of synonymous codons shapes maternal mRNA clearance during MZT in zebrafish (Mishima &amp; Tomari, 2016). This analysis looks at the codon adaptation index, which compares the effect of different codons encoding the same amino acid. However, it is still unknown what is the relative effect of the 61 coding codons independent of the amino acid encoded (non&#8208;synonymous codons), whether all synonymous codons for a given amino acid have similar effects on mRNA stability and whether the translation&#8208;dependent regulatory mechanism of mRNA stability during MZT is conserved across animals. Here, we investigate how translation of specific codons shapes mRNA expression during the MZT and homeostasis, and define a regulatory layer within the genetic code across vertebrates, that we term the &#8220;codon optimality code&#8221;.</text>

      <text>To investigate whether translation of specific codons influences mRNA stability in vertebrates, we developed two complementary approaches. First, we tested whether blocking translation alters the codon composition of an mRNA population due to differential mRNA decay (Fig&#160;1A). To this end, we constructed a library of mRNA sequences by PCR assembly of random fragments of the transcriptome (~300&#8211;500 nt in length) into a reporter DNA that shares (i) identical 5&#8242; and 3&#8242;UTR sequences, (ii) a GFP translation start sequence (26 nt) which we can target with a specific morpholino oligo (MO) to block translation (Giraldez et&#160;al, 2006) (Fig&#160;EV1A), (iii) stop codons in all three frames within the 3&#8242;UTR, and (iv) Illumina adapter sequences to facilitate generation of a sequencing library (Fig&#160;1A). We generated mRNAs from this reporter library in&#160;vitro and injected these highly diverse mRNA sequences (Fig&#160;EV1B) into zebrafish and Xenopus embryos at the one&#8208;cell stage, with the goal to define conserved regulatory sequences between these species. Using high&#8208;throughput sequencing, we quantified the occurrence of each codon in the reporter library 8&#8211;9&#160;h after injection with (&#8722;MO) or without (+MO) translation. We calculated the reporter codon stabilizing index (rCSI) as the statistical significance of the enrichment (+) or depletion (&#8722;) of each codon between these conditions (&#8722;MO versus +MO) in triplicates (F&#8208;value, ANOVA). We found differential accumulation of individual codons in the reporter libraries to be dependent on translation, suggesting that translation of specific codons might influence mRNA stability in vertebrates (Fig&#160;1B and C) (8&#160;h versus 8 +MO zebrafish, 9&#160;h versus 9 +MO Xenopus, P&#160;&lt;&#160;1e&#8208;100, one&#8208;way ANOVA). For example, the GGU codon was significantly enriched when translation was allowed (&#8722;MO), suggesting that GGU stabilizes mRNA in a translation&#8208;dependent manner (Figs&#160;1B and EV1C) (P&#160;&lt;&#160;1e&#8208;300, one&#8208;way ANOVA). In contrast, the codon CAC was significantly depleted in the reporter mRNA library when translation was allowed (&#8722;MO), suggesting that it lowers mRNA stability in a translational&#8208;dependent manner (Figs&#160;1B and EV1C) (P&#160;&lt;&#160;1e&#8208;300, one&#8208;way ANOVA). We observed a strong correlation of the rCSI in zebrafish and Xenopus, suggesting that codon&#8208;mediated transcript stability in the context of translation is conserved across vertebrates (Fig&#160;1C). Comparing the codon composition of the reporter library between late (8 hpi zebrafish, 9 hpi Xenopus) and early stages (2 hpi zebrafish, 1 hpi Xenopus) yielded similar results, suggesting that the effect of different codons on mRNA stability is not due to an off&#8208;target effect of the GFP MO (Fig&#160;EV1E and F). Together, these results suggest that translation of specific codons affects mRNA stability in vertebrates.</text>

      <text>Analysis of the reporter library allowed us to investigate the effects derived from the coding sequence and isolate them from potential regulatory effects of the 5&#8242; and 3&#8242;UTRs, since every mRNA shares the same UTR sequence. To ensure the exogenous nature of the reporter library did not influence our results, we used a second approach to analyze the effect of individual codons on the stability of endogenous maternal mRNAs in&#160;vivo in zebrafish and Xenopus. To avoid confounding effects due to newly transcribed mRNAs, we calculated the half&#8208;life for each mRNA after blocking zygotic transcription with the RNA pol II inhibitor &#945;&#8208;amanitin (Hamatani et&#160;al, 2004) (Table&#160;EV1). We calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between mRNA half&#8208;life and codon occurrence, a metric previously defined in yeast as codon stability coefficient (CSC) (Presnyak et&#160;al, 2015) (Figs&#160;1D and EV1D). We observed that some codons were correlated with mRNA half&#8208;life while others were anticorrelated, consistent with different effects on mRNA stability. Similar to previous observations in yeast, each individual codon only elicits a small effect on the overall stability of the mRNA (Presnyak et&#160;al, 2015). We observed a significant positive correlation for the CSC between zebrafish and Xenopus (P&#160;&lt;&#160;2.2e&#8208;03, R&#160;=&#160;0.65, Spearman), but not with yeast (P&#160;=&#160;0.02, R&#160;=&#160;&#8722;0.27 with Fish, P&#160;&lt;&#160;5e&#8208;03, R&#160;=&#160;&#8722;0.35, Spearman) (Presnyak et&#160;al, 2015), suggesting that the regulatory activity of multiple codons is shared between animals but different from yeast.</text>

      <text>Comparison of the two methods revealed consistent effects for most codons on mRNA stability observed in the reporter library (rCSI) and the endogenous mRNAs (CSC) (Figs&#160;1F and EV1G) (zebrafish, P&#160;=&#160;1e&#8208;3, R&#160;=&#160;0.4, Spearman; Xenopus, P&#160;=&#160;3e&#8208;3, R&#160;=&#160;0.4, Spearman). Because each method has distinct biases aforementioned (i.e. exogenous expression, UTR regulation), we adopted a conservative approach and selected those codons displaying consistent effects in both methods. Based on the consistent effects of each codon on the reporter library and endogenous mRNAs, we defined: optimal codons, with potential stabilizing effects (rCSI&#160;&gt;&#160;250 and CSC&#160;&gt;&#160;0) and non&#8208;optimal codons with potential destabilizing effects (rCSI&#160;&lt;&#160;&#8722;250 and CSC&#160;&lt;&#160;0) (Fig&#160;1F). We next performed sequence analysis of tRNA levels in the zebrafish embryos using highly processive thermostable group II intron reverse transcriptase that allows unwinding of the tRNA secondary structure (TGIRT) (Zheng et&#160;al, 2015). This revealed that optimal codons are decoded by more abundant tRNAs than non&#8208;optimal ones (P&#160;=&#160;3e&#8208;03, Wilcoxon rank&#8208;sum test) (Fig&#160;1G and E). Analysis of the codon usage in the transcriptome indicated that optimal codons are more commonly used in the transcriptome (P&#160;=&#160;2.4e&#8208;06, R&#160;=&#160;0.57, Spearman) (Fig&#160;1G), suggesting that codon optimality may be in part related to tRNA availability and codon usage (dos Reis et&#160;al, 2004; Pechmann &amp; Frydman, 2013; Presnyak et&#160;al, 2015; Richter &amp; Coller, 2015).</text>

Based on different CSC confidence thresholds, we defined two populations within the optimal (red) and non&#8208;optimal (blue) codons (light&#160;=&#160;weak, 0&#160;&lt;&#160;CSC&#160;&lt;&#160;0.03; dark&#160;=&#160;strong, CSC&#160;&gt;&#160;0.03, Fig&#160;1F), which indeed showed different effects on mRNA half&#8208;life (Fig&#160;EV2A). This effect depends on the codons in frame 0 and is not observed in transcripts that are enriched in optimal or non&#8208;optimal codons in reading frames +1 or +2, consistent with translation&#8208;dependent regulation rather than regulation by a sequence motif that is independent of the reading frame (Figs&#160;1H and EV2B and C) (P&#160;=&#160;0.11, Wilcoxon rank&#8208;sum test). Second, we analyzed whether different optimality determines the rate of decay of two sets of reporter mRNAs. Each pair of reporters differs in a single nucleotide insertion after the translation start codon, causing a frameshift that results in opposite codon optimality. Non&#8208;optimal reporters were less stable over time compared to their optimal counterparts (Figs&#160;1I and EV2D and E). When translation was inhibited with cycloheximide, the differential stability is lost (Fig&#160;EV2D). Together, these results define a codon optimality code by which translation of specific codons modulates mRNA stability in vertebrates.</text>

Represented are mRNAs with the highest fraction of strong optimal codons (red, CSC value&#160;&gt;&#160;0.03), weak optimal codons (light red, 0.03&#160;&gt;&#160;CSC&#160;&gt;&#160;0), weak non&#8208;optimal (light blue &#8722;0.03&#160;&lt;&#160;CSC&#160;&lt;&#160;0), or strong non&#8208;optimal (blue CSC&#160;&lt;&#160;&#8722;0.03).

      <text>Programs of maternal mRNA clearance can be distinguished based on their independence (maternal program) or dependence on zygotic transcription (zygotic program) (Tadros &amp; Lipshitz, 2009; Yartseva &amp; Giraldez, 2015). While miR&#8208;430 plays a critical role in the zygotic program (Giraldez et&#160;al, 2006; Bazzini et&#160;al, 2012), the effectors and regulatory sequences in the maternal program are poorly understood (Yartseva &amp; Giraldez, 2015). To determine whether codon optimality regulates mRNA stability/clearance during the MZT, we analyzed the fold change in mRNA levels before (2 hpf) and after zygotic genome activation (6 hpf). We compared the rate of maternal mRNA clearance for transcripts containing putative miR&#8208;430 target sites (6, 7 or 8 mer complementary to miR&#8208;430) (Bazzini et&#160;al, 2012), optimal&#8208; and non&#8208;optimal transcripts in (i) wild&#8208;type embryos, (ii) in embryos where we blocked the zygotic program by inhibiting transcription with &#945;&#8208;amanitin, and (iii) in embryos where we blocked de novo translation with cycloheximide (CHX) at 2 hpf, allowing the initial translation of the maternal mRNAs (0&#8211;2&#160;h), but preventing translation thereafter (Fig&#160;2A). Three lines of evidence indicate that codon identity shapes maternal mRNA decay. First, mRNAs enriched in non&#8208;optimal codons had a higher rate of decay than those enriched in optimal codons in wild&#8208;type embryos (Fig&#160;2B) (P&#160;=&#160;5e&#8208;76, Wilcoxon rank&#8208;sum test). Interestingly, the degree of regulation by non&#8208;optimal codons is similar to that observed in transcripts containing putative miR&#8208;430 target sites (Fig&#160;2B), suggesting that optimality has a strong regulatory effect on mRNA stability (P&#160;=&#160;0.61, Wilcoxon rank&#8208;sum test). Second, in contrast to miR&#8208;430, the effect of codon identity on mRNA stability is independent of transcription, indicating that codon&#8208;mediated regulation of mRNA stability is part of the maternal program of RNA decay (Fig&#160;2B) (P&#160;=&#160;2e&#8208;48, Wilcoxon rank&#8208;sum test) consistent with a recently published study (Mishima &amp; Tomari, 2016). Third, the effect of codon optimality&#8208;mediated stability/decay was abolished after blocking translation with cycloheximide (Fig&#160;2B) (P&#160;=&#160;0.83, Wilcoxon rank&#8208;sum test), consistent with a translation&#8208;dependent regulation of mRNA stability. These results were recapitulated in individual endogenous transcripts using cycloheximide or a targeted translation blocking morpholino to inhibit their translation, reducing the translation&#8208;dependent stabilization/decay of the endogenous mRNA (Fig&#160;2C). These results indicate that the effect of codon identity is part of the maternal program of mRNA clearance and requires translation to regulate mRNA decay during the MZT (Mishima &amp; Tomari, 2016).</text>

      <text>The results presented above indicate that a high density of non&#8208;optimal codons destabilizes mRNAs during the MZT; however, the extent to which codon identity regulates maternal mRNA degradation is unclear. We reasoned that if codon identity plays a major role in maternal mRNA turnover, those mRNAs that are most strongly degraded should be enriched for non&#8208;optimal codons and depleted of optimal codons independently of potential regulatory elements in their 5&#8242; and 3&#8242;UTRs. Alternatively, if codon identity represents a minor mechanism of maternal mRNA decay, then we expect that codon optimality effects would be overshadowed by transcripts under other regulatory mechanisms with neutral codon bias. We analyzed mRNA decay in untreated embryos, in embryos where the zygotic program of mRNA decay is inhibited by &#945;&#8208;amanitin treatment, and in embryos where translation is inhibited by CHX treatment (Fig&#160;2A). We first compared the codon composition of transcripts in the top and bottom quartiles of mRNA fold change during the MZT (between 2 and 6 hpf) (Fig&#160;2D) (2,916 genes). In wild&#8208;type and &#945;&#8208;amanitin&#8208;treated embryos, the most unstable mRNAs were enriched in non&#8208;optimal codons and depleted of optimal codons (Fig&#160;2E). In &#945;&#8208;amanitin&#8208;treated embryos, where the zygotic program of mRNA decay is not active, 22 of 24 non&#8208;optimal codons were enriched in the most unstable mRNAs compared to the most stable ones (Fig&#160;2E). Conversely, 14 of 15 optimal codons were depleted within the most unstable mRNAs compared to the most stable ones (Fig&#160;2E). As a consequence, we observed a significant correlation between codon stability coefficient (CSC) and codons enriched or depleted in unstable transcripts (P&#160;=&#160;2.2e&#8208;16, R&#160;=&#160;0.77 wild type, and P&#160;=&#160;2.2e&#8208;16, R&#160;=&#160;0.84, &#945;&#8208;amanitin, Spearman) (Fig&#160;2E). In contrast, no significant correlation was observed in CHX&#8208;treated embryos (P&#160;=&#160;0.2 R&#160;=&#160;&#8722;0.16, Spearman). These results indicate that codon identity represents a major, translation&#8208;dependent mechanism regulating maternal mRNA stability during the MZT.</text>

      <text>Zebrafish and Xenopus share a significant degree of conservation in the codon optimality code (Fig&#160;1C). To determine whether differential mRNA stability across the MZT is regulated by codon optimality across animal species, we analyzed mRNA decay across Xenopus, mice, and Drosophila (Table&#160;EV2). First, we applied the codon optimality values defined in zebrafish to predict the transcripts enriched in optimal and non&#8208;optimal codons in these species, then we compared mRNA levels before and after the MZT (Fig&#160;3A). We observed that mouse, Xenopus, and Drosophila transcripts enriched for zebrafish optimal codons were significantly more stable than transcripts enriched for non&#8208;optimal codons (P&#160;=&#160;6e&#8208;50 Xenopus, 2e&#8208;15 mouse, 2e&#8208;19 Drosophila, Wilcoxon rank&#8208;sum test) (Fig&#160;3C&#8211;F). Conversely, genes enriched in non&#8208;optimal codons were less stable. Genes enriched in optimal codons were enriched in GO terms related with housekeeping processes such as translation, protein folding, and regulation of actin dynamics (Fig&#160;EV3B and C). Second, to determine whether codon optimality is a major mechanism of regulation for a significant fraction of the maternal transcriptome, we analyzed the codon composition of top (most stable) and bottom (least stable) quartiles of mRNAs, and compared these to the codon optimality in zebrafish (Fig&#160;3B). We observed that optimal codons were depleted and non&#8208;optimal codons were enriched in unstable mRNAs, consistent with a conserved role of codon optimality in the regulation of mRNA stability during the MZT across animals (Fig&#160;3G&#8211;J) (P&#160;=&#160;6.8e&#8208;12 zebrafish, 5e&#8208;11 Xenopus, 1e&#8208;03 mouse, 3e&#8208;04 Drosophila, Spearman). While the effect of non&#8208;optimal codons appears to be weaker in mouse that in other species, future experiments will be needed to determine whether these differences are due to the predicted code used to infer optimality in mice or the differences in timing and cell division that might make other mechanisms more prevalent during this transition (Svoboda et&#160;al, 2015). Together, these results indicate that codon optimality&#8208;mediated control of mRNA stability is a conserved mechanism to regulate differential mRNA stability during the MZT across animals.</text>

      <text>Codon bias correlates with gene expression across multiple species (Ikemura, 1982; Akashi, 1994; Akashi &amp; Gojobori, 2002; Drummond &amp; Wilke, 2008; Kudla et&#160;al, 2009; Novoa &amp; Ribas de Pouplana, 2012). Because codon optimality showed a strong effect on mRNA half&#8208;life during the MZT, we investigated whether it can also influence steady&#8208;state mRNA levels across vertebrates. To this end, we calculated the correlation between codon occurrence and mRNA levels in zebrafish, Xenopus, and 32 human tissues (Uhlen et&#160;al, 2015) (Fig&#160;4A). We observed a significant correlation between codon stability score and mRNA expression levels across zebrafish embryos (Fig&#160;4B), organs (Fig&#160;4B), Xenopus (Fig&#160;4B), and human tissues (Fig&#160;4C). Comparison with the optimality values defined during embryogenesis in zebrafish and Xenopus revealed that highly expressed genes are enriched in optimal codons and depleted in non&#8208;optimal ones in zebrafish and Xenopus (Fig&#160;4B and C). These results indicate that preferential use of specific codons in highly expressed genes is conserved across vertebrates, and remarkably, it corresponds with the CSC defined during embryogenesis (Figs&#160;1D and 4B and C). Based on the differential half&#8208;life of mRNAs with different codon optimality for exogenous (Figs&#160;1C and I, and EV2D and E) and endogenous mRNAs (Figs&#160;1D and H, 2, 3, and EV2C), these results suggest that codon optimality shapes steady&#8208;state mRNA levels across tissues in vertebrates.</text>

      <text>The analysis presented above indicates that specific codons influence mRNA stability during embryogenesis (Figs&#160;1, 2, 3), and are correlated with mRNA expression levels and optimality during tissue homeostasis (Fig&#160;4). Previous studies have shown a strong amino acid bias in the transcriptome. This bias has been explained in terms of tRNA expression, tRNA demand, translational accuracy, and the metabolic &#8220;cost&#8221; of different amino acids (Akashi, 1994; Craig &amp; Weber, 1998; Baudouin&#8208;Cornu et&#160;al, 2001; Akashi &amp; Gojobori, 2002; Pechmann &amp; Frydman, 2013). Our experimental assays of codon identity on mRNA stability raised the possibility that synonymous codons might share similar effects on mRNA levels, resulting in amino acid optimality. This could explain the amino acids bias in the transcriptome due to the consistent effect of synonymous codons on mRNA stability. To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed whether the encoded amino acid influences mRNA stability in zebrafish and Xenopus using two approaches parallel to the codon analysis undertaken in Fig&#160;1. First, we analyzed the reporter amino acid stabilizing index (rASI) as the statistical significance of the enrichment (+) or depletion (&#8722;) of synonymous codons for each amino acid between these conditions (&#8722;MO versus +MO) (F&#8208;value, ANOVA). Second, we analyzed the amino acid stabilization coefficient (ASC, the Pearson correlation coefficient between mRNA half&#8208;life and the amino acids encoded in that transcript). Interestingly, both methods revealed that several encoded amino acids are correlated with mRNA stability. Similar to the analysis preformed at the levels of individual codons, we defined optimal amino acids that are enriched in the library and correlated with longer mRNA half&#8208;life, indicating a potential stabilizing effect (rASI&#160;&gt;&#160;1,000 and ASC&#160;&gt;&#160;0) and non&#8208;optimal codons with potential destabilizing effects (rASI&#160;&lt;&#160;&#8722;1,000 and ASC&#160;&lt;&#160;0) (Figs&#160;4D and EV4A). While this analysis depends in the relative use and optimality for each synonymous codon, there are clear examples of amino acids that are encoded by either optimal (asparagine) or non&#8208;optimal (histidine) codons. These results indicate that amino acids can also be defined as optimal and non&#8208;optimal, influencing mRNA stability when they are decoded, yet future experiments will be needed to uncouple codon and amino acid optimality. This observation adds a novel layer of complexity into the codon optimality, where the encoded amino acid might affect the stability of the translated mRNA.</text>

      <text>To evaluate whether amino acid optimality can partially explain the amino acid bias in gene expression in homeostasis, we calculated the correlation between amino acid occurrence and mRNA levels in zebrafish and Xenopus (Fig&#160;4A). We found that optimal amino acids are preferentially used in highly expressed genes and non&#8208;optimal amino acids are preferentially used in lowly expressed genes in both zebrafish and Xenopus (Fig&#160;4E). These results suggest that part of the amino acid bias in the transcriptome can be explained by amino acid optimality and the concordant effect of synonymous codons on mRNA stability.</text>

      <text>The length of the poly(A) tail influences translation and stability of mRNAs (Eckmann et&#160;al, 2011; Weill et&#160;al, 2012; Subtelny et&#160;al, 2014). Three lines of evidence indicate that codon identity modulates the polyadenylation status of the mRNA. First, we analyzed the polyadenylation status of mRNAs with different codon optimality content across different embryonic stages (2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hpf). To this end, we calculated the fraction of deadenylated mRNAs by comparing the levels of poly(A+)&#8208;containing mRNA (oligo(dT) purified) with total RNA depleted of ribosomal RNA. This provides an indirect measurement of the polyadenylation status and represents the proportion of deadenylated and polyadenylated mRNAs rather than a direct measurement of their length (Bazzini et&#160;al, 2012; Park et&#160;al, 2016). As a control, we evaluated histone mRNAs, which are typically deadenylated, and found that they displayed a low poly(A)/total RNA ratio (Fig&#160;EV4B) supporting the use of the poly(A+)/total RNA ratio as a proxy of the polyadenylation status. We found that mRNAs enriched in non&#8208;optimal codons display a lower polyadenylation status (poly(A)/total RNA ratio) compared to those enriched in optimal codons across developmental stages (Figs&#160;5A and EV4D) (P&#160;=&#160;6e&#8208;35, Wilcoxon rank&#8208;sum test). Second, we analyzed the poly(A) tail length of mRNAs throughout early zebrafish embryogenesis using previously generated PAL&#8208;seq data (Subtelny et&#160;al, 2014). We found that mRNAs enriched in non&#8208;optimal codons had shorter poly(A) tails at 4 and 6 hpf, whereas mRNAs enriched in optimal codons had longer poly(A) tails (Fig&#160;EV4C) (P&#160;=&#160;5e&#8208;31, P&#160;=&#160;2e&#8208;43, Wilcoxon rank&#8208;sum test). Their initial poly(A) tail lengths were comparable (P&#160;=&#160;0.03, Wilcoxon rank&#8208;sum test) (Fig&#160;EV4C), consistent with similar polyadenylation status for both mRNA populations by 2 hpf (Fig&#160;EV4D) (P&#160;=&#160;3e&#8208;05, Wilcoxon rank&#8208;sum test). Third, we analyzed the poly(A) tail length using high&#8208;resolution electrophoresis (Bazzini et&#160;al, 2012) for two sets of reporter mRNAs that had opposite codon optimality depending on the frame in which they were translated (Figs&#160;1I and EV2E). Non&#8208;optimal reporters displayed shorter poly(A) tails (Figs&#160;5B and EV4E) and faster decay over time than their optimal counterparts, although their initial poly(A) status was comparable at 1 hpi (Figs&#160;1I, 5B, EV2E, and EV4E). Together, consistent with recent reports (Mishima &amp; Tomari, 2016), these results indicate that a higher ratio of non&#8208;optimal/optimal codons is associated with a shorter poly(A) tail, mRNA destabilization and decay (Fig&#160;6A).</text>

      <text>Translation efficiency across mRNAs in&#160;vivo can vary over 250&#8208;fold between different genes. Ribosome footprinting provides a quantitative measurement of translation and, upon normalization to total RNA, allows us to calculate the translation efficiency for each gene (Ingolia et&#160;al, 2009). While the codon adaptation index (Sharp &amp; Li, 1987) only explains a small portion of the variance in protein per mRNA in yeast (Ingolia et&#160;al, 2009) and bacteria (Plotkin &amp; Kudla, 2011), differences in codon optimality in yeast for individual reporter genes result in different protein output and inferred translation efficiency (Presnyak et&#160;al, 2015). Furthermore, it has been shown that codon composition can influence translation efficiency (Hussmann et&#160;al, 2015). To investigate the effect of codon optimality in translation in&#160;vivo in vertebrates, we measured translation efficiency using ribosome footprinting across different developmental time points in zebrafish embryos (2, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hpf) (Bazzini et&#160;al, 2014). Because codon optimality influences mRNA levels, we used a control population with a similar mRNA level distribution (48&#160;h P&#160;=&#160;1e&#8208;3 for optimal, P&#160;=&#160;0.5 for non&#8208;optimal, Wilcoxon rank&#8208;sum test) (Figs&#160;5C and EV5A). mRNAs enriched in optimal codons had significantly higher translation efficiency than the control set across time points (48&#160;h P&#160;=&#160;3e&#8208;16, Wilcoxon rank&#8208;sum test) (Figs&#160;5D and EV5A). In contrast, mRNAs enriched in non&#8208;optimal codons displayed lower translation efficiency than their control set (48&#160;h P&#160;=&#160;5e&#8208;19, Wilcoxon rank&#8208;sum test) (Figs&#160;5D and EV5A). Consistent with these observations, ribosome profiling of individual genes with different optimality displays dramatically different ribosome occupancy, with higher translation of optimal genes (Fig&#160;EV5B). To determine whether protein production is indeed affected by the codon optimality of individual genes, we compared GFP expression from two reporter mRNAs consisting of an optimal or non&#8208;optimal coding sequence followed by a ribosome skipping sequence (P2A) (Donnelly et&#160;al, 2001; de Felipe et&#160;al, 2006) and GFP. This allowed the analysis of protein production in&#160;vivo independently of the half&#8208;life of the protein analyzed. We observed higher translation of the optimal reporter compared to the non&#8208;optimal one (Fig&#160;5E), while no difference was observed in the expression levels of the co&#8208;injected dsRed control mRNA (Fig&#160;5E). Taken together, these results indicate that codon optimality shapes translation efficiency and protein output in&#160;vivo.</text>

The length of the poly(A) tail as well as factors such microRNA or RNA binding protein can modulate translation and consequently modulate the effects of codon optimality on mRNA stability. Alternatively, specific cellular factors may affect the codon optimality code and so change the gene expression across tissues by modifying mRNA stability. For example, in the oocyte the level of translation is low. After egg activation and/or fertilization translation is activated, consequently a gene enriched in non&#8208;optimal codons may become unstable after translation is activated.</text>

      <text>Our study identifies mRNA translation and codon optimality as a conserved mechanism shaping maternal mRNA clearance during early embryogenesis. mRNAs with a high proportion of non&#8208;optimal codons are less stable, whereas the most stable mRNAs show an enrichment of optimal codons (Figs&#160;1 and 2). Based on our current analysis, we propose that this mechanism is a key part of the maternal program of mRNA regulation and modulates the stability and decay of several thousand maternal mRNAs in zebrafish (Figs&#160;2 and 3). A recent analysis of codons on mRNA stability in zebrafish by Mishima and Tomari relay on the codon adaptation index, which only allows to measure the relative effects of synonymous codons, but does not allow comparison of codons encoding for different amino acids (Mishima &amp; Tomari, 2016). In contrast, our study directly measures the relative effects of all codons on mRNA stability in a translation&#8208;dependent manner, allowing direct comparison of synonymous and non&#8208;synonymous codons on mRNA stability. The strength of the regulation and number of genes modulated by codon optimality are comparable to that observed by microRNAs during this process (Fig&#160;2). It is likely that these mechanisms function in a fraction of genes with additional regulatory motifs in the 3&#8242;UTR and RNA binding proteins to modulate mRNA stability during the MZT (Tadros &amp; Lipshitz, 2009; Yartseva &amp; Giraldez, 2015). Indeed, it has been shown that the effect of the codon adaptation index on mRNA stability is stronger in transcripts with shorter 3&#8242;UTRs (Mishima &amp; Tomari, 2016), suggesting that longer UTRs might harbor regulatory elements that antagonize the effect of codon optimality. Interestingly, maternal mRNAs deposited in the egg are stable until egg activation, fertilization, or zygotic genome activation, depending on the specific mRNA (Mendez &amp; Richter, 2001; Clark et&#160;al, 2007; Yartseva &amp; Giraldez, 2015). Codon optimality could provide a mechanism to trigger mRNA decay upon activation of translation following fertilization and might explain the tight control between the simultaneous activation of translation and mRNA deadenylation/destabilization upon fertilization (Fig&#160;EV5C) (Richter &amp; Coller, 2015). Conversely, factors that modulate translation could influence mRNA stability via codon optimality, thus providing a valuable mechanism for feedback regulation in the cell (Fig&#160;EV5C). For example, this mechanism could modulate degradation/stability once mRNAs are localized to distinct subcellular regions and initiate translation, such as during synaptic regulation (Kiebler &amp; DesGroseillers, 2000; Martin &amp; Ephrussi, 2009), axis specification during development (Johnstone &amp; Lasko, 2001), or germ cell specification (Slaidina &amp; Lehmann, 2014).</text>

      <text>By analyzing the effect of translation on mRNA stability using a reporter library and endogenous mRNA half&#8208;life (Fig&#160;1), we defined a codon optimality code during early embryogenesis (Fig&#160;6). Our results provide evidence for the conservation of codon optimality (Presnyak et&#160;al, 2015) across vertebrates (Figs&#160;1, 3 and 4), identify physiological contexts where this mechanism regulates gene expression during the MZT (Figs&#160;2 and 3), and suggest that specific amino acids are associated with differential mRNA stabilization (Fig&#160;4). The bias between codons or amino acids, and mRNA expression levels has been previously recognized across species and is thought to result from selection for efficient, accurate translation, and folding of highly expressed genes (Ikemura, 1982; Akashi, 1994; Akashi &amp; Gojobori, 2002; Drummond &amp; Wilke, 2008; Kudla et&#160;al, 2009; Novoa &amp; Ribas de Pouplana, 2012). The amino acid optimality code (Fig&#160;6) provides an alternative perspective on sequence changes between paralogs in evolution and human disease. Individual gene sequence might be determined not only by the function of the protein but also by its optimality with respect to mRNA stability and translation efficiency potentially driving sequence evolution. Based on the strong effect of codon optimality on mRNA stability and the relationship between codon&#160;bias and optimality, codon optimality is a strong post&#8208;transcriptional regulatory mechanism in vertebrates that shapes gene expression across tissues. This mechanism can explain the previously recognized relationship between codons used or amino acids encoded in the transcriptome and mRNA expression levels across metazoans in both prokaryotes and eukaryotic cells (Ikemura, 1982; Akashi &amp; Gojobori, 2002; Akashi, 2003; Hussmann et&#160;al, 2015). However, metazoans have different evolutionary constraints regarding adaptation, metabolic and nutrients availability than yeast or prokaryotes. We observe that there is a correlation between tRNA levels and optimality, with non&#8208;optimal codons associated with lower tRNA levels (Fig&#160;1). Indeed, previous studies of tRNAs in tumor cells have found that different gene networks driving proliferation and cell differentiation have different codon usage, and the activation of these programs is influenced by different tRNA levels (Gingold et&#160;al, 2014), suggesting that they are under the regulation of codon optimality. The codon optimality code defined during early embryogenesis (Fig&#160;1) correlates with codon bias in homeostasis (Fig&#160;4), suggesting that the code is conserved between early embryogenesis (MZT) and somatic tissues. However, further experiments, defining codon optimality code in specific cell types or under different physiological conditions, that is, stress, will define how the code changes with cell identity and cellular state. In addition to tRNA levels, tRNA modification might also play a key role in optimality (Gustilo et&#160;al, 2008; Novoa et&#160;al, 2012). Previous studies in yeast have linked the effect of codon optimality to the translocation speed of the ribosome, which also influences protein folding (Presnyak et&#160;al, 2015; Yu et&#160;al, 2015). Reduced codon optimality coincides with shorter poly(A) tail length (Fig&#160;5). In addition, we found the genes enriched in non&#8208;optimal codon present lower translation efficiency, suggesting that codon optimality also influences the level of translation (Fig&#160;5). However, we cannot distinguish whether the poly(A) length changes are the cause or consequence of the translation differences caused by codon optimality. In addition, we cannot exclude that additional features that influence translation initiation are co&#8208;selected with optimal codons (Fig&#160;EV3A). Our results are consistent with the role of codon optimality in translation efficiency and the speed of ribosome translocation in yeast (Novoa &amp; Ribas de Pouplana, 2012; Hussmann et&#160;al, 2015; Presnyak et&#160;al, 2015). Based on the slower translocation rates in yeast over non&#8208;optimal codons (Presnyak et&#160;al, 2015), we speculate that slower ribosome translocation might allow the recruitment of accessory proteins that engage the deadenylation machinery. While we observe a correlation between tRNA levels and the extremes of optimality, it is likely that this code integrates multiple inputs of translation from tRNA availability and accuracy (Akashi, 1994; Ishimura et&#160;al, 2014; Hussmann et&#160;al, 2015), tRNA modification (Gustilo et&#160;al, 2008; Novoa et&#160;al, 2012), to peptide bond formation, amino acid identity, and other factors influencing the translocation rate and ultimately elongation (Baragana et&#160;al, 2015; Faller et&#160;al, 2015). Future studies will be needed to determine how the ribosome or accessory proteins decode codon optimality (Richter &amp; Coller, 2015), and how this code is regulated across cellular transitions, tissues, and pathological states.</text>

      <text>Sequences that did not contain the exact first 26&#8208;nt expected translated sequence (ATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCTGTC) and the exact added stop codons (CTAGCTACCTA) were discarded. The remaining sequences were mapped with Bowtie2 to zebrafish Ensembl release 80 cDNA (longest transcript per gene) using the following parameters: &#8211;local, &#8211;no&#8208;mixed, &#8211;no&#8208;discordant, &#8211;no&#8208;overlap, &#8211;norc, &#8211;no&#8208;unal, &#8208;I 200, &#8208;X 600 (Langmead &amp; Salzberg, 2012; Cunningham et&#160;al, 2014). The fragment sequences spanning the full locus delineated by each pair of reads were extracted using SAMtools and BEDTools (Li et&#160;al, 2009; Quinlan &amp; Hall, 2010). After mapping, the 5&#8242; 26&#8208;nt translated sequence was added back to all fragments. All sequences with stop codons in frame were discarded. Each of the coding codons (61) was counted, and codon frequencies were computed using the length of the coding sequence. Frequencies of each codons were compared between conditions (e.g. 8&#160;h with and 8&#160;h without MO, or 8&#160;h versus 2&#160;h) using the three replicates using a analysis of the variance (ANOVA). The F&#8208;value was multiplied by &#8722;1 if the average of medians was higher in the presence of the MO. This final positive or negative F&#8208;value was termed as reporter codon stabilizing index (rCSI). Therefore, optimal codon displayed a higher average of the medians in the absence of MO than in the presence of MO and therefore present a positive rCSI. Non&#8208;optimal displayed a higher average of the medians in the presence of MO than in the absence of MO and so presented a negative rCSI. In the case of Xenopus 9&#160;h with MO, one sample was discarded for low&#8208;quality reasons. The codons used (Fig&#160;1E) were calculated by multiplying the number of each codon by the level of mRNA at 6&#160;h. The same rCSI calculations were done at the level of amino acid, calculating the reporter amino acid stabilizing index (rASI).</text>

Twenty&#8208;five embryos were collected and total RNA isolated with TRIzol. The zebrafish samples were spiked in with Yeast RNA for normalization purposes. Depletion of ribosomal RNA was performed with Ribo&#8208;Zero Gold kits (Epicentre) according to the published protocol.

Optimal codons were defined as the codons with rCSI higher than 250 and a positive CSC. Non&#8208;optimal codons presented rCSI lower than &#8722;250 and negative CSC.

Functional enrichments were tested with Fisher's exact tests using all genes as background as implemented in the GOATOOLS. False discovery rate was applied to correct for multiple testing.

      <text>The tRNA sequencing libraries were constructed by using TGIRT&#8208;seq, which gives full&#8208;length reads of tRNAs (Qin et&#160;al, 2016). Briefly, the template&#8208;switching reverse transcription reactions were done by using an initial template&#8211;primer substrate consisting of a 34&#8208;nt RNA oligonucleotide, which contains an Illumina Read 2 primer&#8208;binding site and a 3&#8242;&#8208;blocking group (C3 Spacer, 3SpC3; IDT), annealed to a complementary 35&#8208;nt DNA primer that leaves an equimolar mixture of A, C, G, or T single nucleotide 3&#8242; overhangs. Reactions were done in 20&#160;&#956;l of reaction medium containing 30&#8211;100&#160;ng tRNA, 100&#160;nM template&#8211;primer substrate, 1&#160;&#956;M TGIRT enzyme (TGIRT&#8208;III; InGex), and 1&#160;mM dNTPs (an equimolar mix of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP) in 450&#160;mM NaCl, 5&#160;mM MgCl2, 20&#160;mM Tris&#8211;HCl, pH 7.5, and 5&#160;mM dithiothreitol (DTT). DTT was prepared from a frozen 1&#160;M stock solution. Reactions were assembled by adding all components, except dNTPs, to a sterile PCR tube containing tRNAs with the TGIRT enzyme added last. After pre&#8208;incubating at room temperature for 30&#160;min, reactions were initiated by adding dNTPs and incubated for 30&#160;min at 60&#176;C. cDNA synthesis was terminated by adding 5&#160;M NaOH to a final concentration of 0.25&#160;M, incubating at 95&#176;C for 3&#160;min, and then neutralizing with 5&#160;M HCl. The resulting cDNAs were purified with a MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit (QIAGEN) and ligated at their 3&#8242;&#8208;end to a 5&#8242;&#8208;adenlyated/3&#8242;&#8208;blocked (C3 spacer, 3SpC3; IDT) adapter by using Thermostable 5&#8242; AppDNA/RNA Ligase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The ligated cDNA products were re&#8208;purified with a MinElute column and amplified by PCR by using Phusion High&#8208;Fidelity DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 200&#160;nM of Illumina multiplex and 200&#160;nM of barcode primers. PCR was done with initial denaturation at 98&#176;C for 5&#160;s followed by eight cycles of 98&#176;C for 5&#160;s, 60&#176;C for 10&#160;s and 72&#176;C for 10&#160;s. The PCR products were purified by using the Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter) and sequenced on a NextSeq 500 instrument (Illumina) to obtain 75&#8208;nt paired&#8208;end reads.</text>

      <text>Illumina TruSeq DNA adapter and primer sequences were trimmed from the reads, and reads &lt;&#160;18 nt after trimming were discarded. Reads were then mapped by using TopHat v2.0.10 (default settings) to the zebrafish genome reference sequence (Ensembl Zv9) (Langmead &amp; Salzberg, 2012). Unmapped reads from this first pass (Pass 1) were remapped to the Zv9 reference genome by Bowtie2 v2.1.0 with local alignment (default settings) to improve the mapping rate for those reads that contain post&#8208;transcriptionally added nucleotides [e.g. CCA and poly(U)], untrimmed adapter sequences, and non&#8208;templated nucleotides added to the 3&#8242;&#8208;end of the cDNAs by TGIRT enzymes (Pass 2) (Kim et&#160;al, 2013). To improve the mapping rate for tRNAs, mapped reads from Passes 1 and 2 were intersected with tRNA annotations from the Genomic tRNA Database (Lowe &amp; Eddy, 1997) to collect both uniquely and multiply mapped tRNAs reads. These were then combined with unmapped reads after Pass 2, and the combined reads were mapped to zebrafish tRNA reference sequences (UCSC genome browser website) using Bowtie2 local alignment with default settings. Because similar or identical tRNAs with the same anticodon can be multiply mapped to different tRNA loci by Bowtie2, mapped tRNA reads with MAPQ &#8805;&#160;1 were combined according to their tRNA anticodon prior to calculating the tRNA read counts. Only those features with 10 or more mapped reads were counted.</text>
