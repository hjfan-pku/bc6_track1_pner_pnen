      <text>Sickness behavior defines the endocrine, autonomic, behavioral, and metabolic responses associated with infection. While inflammatory responses were suggested to be instrumental in the loss of appetite and body weight, the molecular underpinning remains unknown. Here, we show that systemic or central lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection results in specific hypothalamic changes characterized by a precocious increase in the chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) followed by an increase in pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines and a decrease in the orexigenic neuropeptide melanin&#8208;concentrating hormone (MCH). We therefore hypothesized that CCL2 could be the central relay for the loss in body weight induced by the inflammatory signal LPS. We find that central delivery of CCL2 promotes neuroinflammation and the decrease in MCH and body weight. MCH neurons express CCL2 receptor and respond to CCL2 by decreasing both electrical activity and MCH release. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of CCL2 signaling opposes the response to LPS at both molecular and physiologic levels. We conclude that CCL2 signaling onto MCH neurons represents a core mechanism that relays peripheral inflammation to sickness behavior.</text>

      <text>Sickness behavior refers to the broad metabolic and behavioral changes that develop over the course of illness in response to inflammatory stimuli. Among these, pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin&#8208;1 (IL&#8208;1), interleukin&#8208;6 (IL&#8208;6), and tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945; (TNF&#8208;&#945;), as well as chemokines, can directly alters mood, food intake, and body weight through local action onto central hypothalamic network regulation energy balance and stress response 1, 2, 3, 4.</text>

      <text>In visceral injuries, local production of cytokines can rapidly signal to the brain via a direct action onto primary afferent nerves, including the vagus and the trigeminal nerves. Following bacterial infection, activation of resident macrophages of the choroid plexus and of the circumventricular organs, devoid of blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), induces synthesis of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines that directly enter the brain. Peripheral cytokines may also cross the BBB using saturable transport systems or transitory local openings. Cytokine activation of perivascular macrophages and brain endothelial cells generates prostaglandins E2 that act on the hypothalamo&#8211;pituitary&#8211;adrenal axis to regulate stress responses 5. Finally, the central nervous system (CNS) may synthesize de novo cytokines following systemic or central inflammation 6. However, the cellular and molecular basis by which peripheral inflammation is integrated centrally to adapt food intake and body weight remains largely unknown.</text>

      <text>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), when injected peripherally, triggers all the key features of sickness behavior, that is, peripheral and central inflammation, suppression of appetite, and weight loss 7. While the molecular underpinnings remain unknown, it has been shown that central, rather than peripheral, inflammation is mediating LPS&#8208;induced appetite and weight loss 8, and interestingly, CNS inflammation can be triggered independently from systemic cytokines, by non&#8208;hematopoietic cells of the brain expressing the LPS receptor: the Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 (TLR4) 9. Central neural substrate regulating feeding and energy expenditure is composed of several neuropeptidergic circuits primarily located in the hypothalamus and brainstem. Among these, the &#8220;first&#8208;order&#8221; neuronal populations that lie close to circumventricular organs integrate circulating signals of hunger and satiety and represent also a target for peripheral inflammatory signals. They include both orexigenic/anabolic producing neuropeptide Y (NPY)/agouti&#8208;related polypeptide (AgRP) and anorectic/catabolic neurons that produce pro&#8208;opiomelanocortin (POMC)/cocaine&#8208; and amphetamine&#8208;regulated transcript (CART) in the arcuate nucleus (ARC). Once ARC neurons have integrated peripheral signals, they, in turn, project to &#8220;second&#8208;order&#8221; neurons located in various brain regions, including hypothalamic areas such as the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), the ventromedial hypothalamic area (VMH), and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) 10, 11. The hypothalamus&#8211;brainstem structure is referred as to the homeostatic circuitry and operates adaptive metabolic and behavioral responses that regulate body weight. 12.</text>

      <text>Thus, it was tempting to speculate that central inflammatory signaling may temporarily alter &#8220;first&#8208;order&#8221; and &#8220;second&#8208;order&#8221; neurons to promote LPS&#8208;provoked weight loss. While few interleukins receptors were found on hypothalamic neurons 13, 14, they are particularly lacking in the LHA neurons, whereas chemokine receptors are widely expressed and functional onto hypothalamic neurons 15, particularly the orexigenic melanin&#8208;concentrating hormone (MCH) 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 and the hypocretins/orexins (ORX) neurons 21.</text>

      <text>Among chemokines, we identified the monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 MCP&#8208;1/C&#8208;C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) as a potential key player because CCL2 is expressed in glial cells and discrete neuronal populations 22, is consistently increased in the CNS following peripheral inflammation 23, and has been shown to be crucially involved in LPS&#8208;mediated brain inflammation 24. Using genetic, electrophysiological, and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrate that CCL2/CCR2 signaling onto MCH neurons is the core mechanism by which peripheral inflammatory response is centrally relayed to operate the behavioral and metabolic changes associated with sickness behavior.</text>

      <text>In order to fully characterize the sequence of molecular events that occurs at the central level in response to peripheral inflammation, we first studied the dose&#8211;response relationship of peripheral LPS injection on sickness behavior response. Intraperitoneal (ip) injection of 5 &#956;g of LPS per mouse recapitulated most of the characteristic response seen in sickness behavior and was therefore selected for subsequent molecular analyses (Fig EV1A). We next performed a time&#8208;course study using targeted transcription profiling by PCR analysis study of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine genes (IL&#8208;1&#946;, IL&#8208;6, TNF&#8208;&#945;) and selected neuropeptide&#8208;encoding genes involved in feeding behavior to precise the molecular events that occur at hypothalamic level after ip LPS injection. As expected 25, ip LPS injection induced a very early (1&#8211;3 after post&#8208;injection) overexpression of the pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine mRNAs (IL&#8208;1&#946;, IL&#8208;6, TNF&#8208;&#945;), with specific profiles (Fig EV1B). Ip LPS challenge also induced, 1 h after injection, a transitory, yet massive (up to 20&#8208;fold), induction of all the energy&#8208;related neuropeptide mRNA&#8208;encoding genes expressed in the ARC (POMC, CART, NPY, AgRP) (Fig EV1D). Strikingly, ip LPS injection induced a delayed and sustained decrease in MCH and ORX mRNA expression 24 and 48 h after injection (Fig EV1E).</text>

      <text>A dose of 500 ng of LPS per mouse injected centrally was selected based on its ability to recapitulate the time course of weight loss observed after peripheral injection (Fig 1A). Hypothalamic mRNA coding for cytokines and chemokines were quantified in a time window that precedes the first wave of increased cytokine gene expression and before downregulation of MCH or ORX gene expression, that is, 6 h after intracerebroventricular (icv) LPS or saline injection. LPS induced a sixfold to eightfold increase in mRNA&#8208;encoding IL&#8208;1&#946;, IL&#8208;17A, and several other pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines, including TNF&#8208;&#945; (Fig 1B). Strikingly, the most robust activation of expression was found for genes encoding the CCL chemokines that bind to the CCR2 and/or CCR5 receptors (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, and CCL7 (Fig 1C)). As CCL2 plays a major role in brain inflammation following peripheral injection of LPS and selectively interacts with CCR2 in rodent brains 24, 26, 27, we focused on the CCL2/CCR2 signaling as a potential key mechanism relaying centrally the action of peripheral inflammation.</text>

      <text>Brain injection of 500 ng of LPS in WT mice induced a long&#8208;lasting decrease in body weight compared to saline&#8208;injected WT mice (Fig 2A and Appendix Fig S2). Pharmacologic or genetic blockade of CCL2/CCR2 signaling was achieved through either central CCR2 antagonist injection or in the genetic context of CCR2 KO mice. CCR2 antagonist&#8208;injected mice and genetic impairment of CCR2 signaling prevented LPS&#8208;induced weight loss with a maximum effect at the early times (6&#8211;8 h) and a late partial recovery (Fig 2A&#8211;C). As shown in the Figs EV2A and B and 2A and B, icv administration of CCR2 antagonist INCB3344 or genetic invalidation of CCR2 expression in mice induced a decrease in the percentage of weight loss of similar magnitude upon peripheral injection of LPS (Fig EV2A and B and Appendix Fig S1) or following icv LPS injection (Fig 2A and B) in mice.</text>

      <text>Integrated analysis of energy homeostasis using indirect calorimetry coupled with activity and feeding measurement was used to fully characterize the physiologic implication of CCL2/CCR2 signaling in LPS&#8208;induced metabolic changes. Body weight loss following central LPS delivery was associated with a sharp decrease in food intake, energy expenditure, locomotor activity, and a metabolic shift toward lipid oxidation profile as indicated by both fat oxidation and respiratory quotient analysis (Figs 2 and EV3). Pharmacologically opposing CCR2 signaling through central delivery of the selective CCR2 antagonist INCB3344 28 affected various aspects of LPS&#8208;induced weight loss. First, CCR2 antagonist counteracted the anorectic response initiated by LPS (Fig 2D and E) and mitigated the acute decrease in energy expenditure (Fig EV3C and D). Peripheral substrate utilization was calculated based on respiratory exchange ratio (VCO2/VO2: RER = 1 indicative of carbohydrate oxidation and RER = 0.7 indicative of lipid oxidation). Icv LPS injection induced a sharp shift in lipid oxidation profile (Figs 2F and G, and EV3E and F) and CCR2 signaling blockade protected fat stores while opposing this shift (Figs 2F and G, and EV3E and F). Importantly, the action of both LPS and CCR2 signaling could only be partially correlated to change in food intake and locomotor activity (Figs 2D and E, and EV3A and B). Those results indicate that central inflammation not only affects feeding but also peripheral nutrient partitioning in a CCR2&#8208;dependent manner.</text>

      <text>To study the molecular mechanisms involved in inflammation&#8208;induced weight loss and associated changes in energy balance at the brain level, and particularly at the hypothalamic level, we determined levels of mRNA&#8208;encoding cytokines (IL&#8208;1&#946;, IL&#8208;6, TNF&#8208;&#945;), 1, 3, 6, 18, and 24 h after icv injection of LPS, to cover primary responses, and 18 and 24 h after injection, to analyze secondary and counteractive responses. As shown in Fig 3A, IL&#8208;1&#946; mRNA expression levels displayed two distinct waves that peaked at 3 and 18 h (23&#8208;fold) post&#8208;injection while IL&#8208;6 mRNA (16&#8208;fold) and TNF&#8208;&#945; mRNA (sevenfold) levels were transitorily elevated at 3 h in the LPS&#8208;treated group as compared to the saline controls. We also determined the temporal patterns of CCL2 expression induced by icv injection of LPS and confirmed the strong upregulation of both gene and protein, 3 and 6 h after icv LPS (Fig 3B and C) and ip (Fig EV1C) injection, respectively.</text>

      <text>For the neuropeptide&#8208;encoding mRNAs, there are differentiable responses following LPS icv injection. Robust (up to 12&#8208;fold) and transitory peak of induction was found for POMC (but not CART; Fig EV4A and B), whereas NPY (and also AgRP) mRNA expression was downregulated (twofold) at 1 h post&#8208;injection (Fig EV4C and D). In contrast, a late and sustained downregulation occurred for MCH mRNA (Fig 3D) and ORX (Fig EV5A) 18 and 24 h after LPS injection. We therefore characterized the protein levels of MCH and ORX and found that they followed the mRNA patterns observed at 1, 6, 18 h LPS post&#8208;injection. MCH (53.5 &#177; 5.2 ng/mg of proteins) (Fig 3E) and ORX (83.1 &#177; 2.1 ng/mg of proteins; Fig EV5B) dropped down compared to saline group at 18 h post&#8208;LPS.

      <text>Finally, we examined the relative importance of the CCR2 signaling pathway in the MCH&#8208;expressing neuronal network. Strikingly, the twofold decrease in MCH mRNA expression at 18 h LPS post&#8208;injection was reversed in mice treated with the selective CCR2 antagonist INCB3344 28 and in CCR2 KO mice (at 81 and 77% of the initial MCH mRNA content, respectively) (Fig 3F). Strikingly, the 50% reduction in MCH mRNA expression was also similarly prevented under ip LPS administration (Fig EV2C). Altogether, these results suggest that CCR2 signaling could play a fundamental role in the LPS&#8208;based neuroinflammatory response leading to MCH gene downregulation.</text>

      <text>We tested thereafter the hypothesis that a specific activation of CCR2 signaling may mimic the spectrum of cytokine/chemokine and neuropeptide gene expression variations observed following LPS treatment.

A fast (1 h) and long&#8208;lasting (up to 18 h) activation of both CCL2 mRNA and protein levels was also found in the hypothalamus (Fig 4B and C). Finally, expression of MCH or ORX&#8208;encoding mRNA was downregulated by 2.1&#8208; and 2.6&#8208;fold at 6 and 18 h, respectively (Figs 4D and EV5C). At the protein levels, CCL2 injection significantly decreased by twofold both MCH and ORX peptide concentrations compared to control group at 6 and 18 h post&#8208;injection (Figs 4E and EV5D).

      <text>We investigated whether the hyperpolarization induced by CCR2 activation could be due to G protein activated inward rectifier current (GIRK) activation. The effect inverted around &#8722;80 mV that is the equilibrium potential for K+ ions. We found that 1 nM CCL2 effect was significantly blocked by previous application of 200 &#956;M barium, a concentration known to inhibit specifically KIR channels (Fig 5C). About 200 &#956;M barium alone induced a significant depolarization of MCH neurons (of 10.00 &#177; 1.67 mV), suggesting that KIR channels are spontaneously opened under control conditions in MCH neurons. We then measured the current induced by CCL2 in voltage&#8208;clamp at a holding potential of &#8722;60 mV, with a KCl intracellular solution. CCL2 (10 nM) induced a small outward current (+7.5 &#177; 1.44 pA) associated with a decrease in membrane resistance (Fig EV6A and B). CCL2 (10 nM) also increased by 30% the frequency of spontaneous post&#8208;synaptic currents without significant effect on the amplitude of these events (Fig EV6C and D).</text>

      <text>Finally, we investigated the consequences of the CCL2 effects on action potential (AP) discharge (Fig 5D). CCL2 induces either delays (Fig 5D, left panel) or failures (Fig 5D, right panel) in action potential emission. This effect was likely a consequence of a decrease in membrane resistance due to GIRK channels and/or receptor channels opening.</text>

      <text>Based on our observations of decrease in MCH neurons excitability, we evaluated whether CCL2 could modulate MCH release induced by a robust KCl&#8208;mediated neuronal depolarization. Perifusion of hypothalamic tissues with 60 mM KCl for 30 min induced a 3.1&#8208;fold increase in MCH release (Fig 5E, black line). Strikingly, this increase was fully blunted by co&#8208;application of CCL2 (Fig 5E, red line), an inhibitory effect reversed by addition of the CCR2 antagonist INCB3344 (Fig 5E, blue line). In contrast to MCH secretion, application of CCL2 did not prevent ORX release (Fig EV5F).</text>

      <text>Finally, we tested whether in vivo MCH signaling through MCHR1 was an important element to mediate LPS&#8208; or CCL2&#8208;induced weight loss (Fig 5F). In agreement with previous studies 18, 31, the pharmacological inhibition of the MCH receptor by the specific antagonist H6408 blocked the basal orexigenic tone leading to a slight weight loss. LPS but not CCL2 injection doubled this response, suggesting a similar range of action for CCL2 or MCH antagonist on the weight loss. Similar effects were noted in presence or not of H6408 at both 6 and 24 h LPS post&#8208;injection. In contrast, an additive effect of the MCH antagonist was noted on the CCL2&#8208;driven weight loss at 6 h but not 24 h, highly suggesting that the MCH signaling pathway could participate as a major downstream element at this early time.</text>

      <text>Here, we demonstrated that LPS&#8208;induced behavioral and metabolic adaptation resulting in weight loss depends on the integrity of the CCR2 signaling in MCH&#8208;expressing neurons and revealed for the first time that locally produced brain chemokines may act directly on appetite&#8208;regulating neuronal networks. Brain inflammation was induced by ip and icv injections of LPS, as confirmed by an upregulation of cytokines such as IL&#8208;1&#946;, that followed the characteristic two wave patterns observed after peripheral LPS injection 37. Beneficial and detrimental effects of IL&#8208;1&#946; production have been linked to neuroinflammatory conditions and neurodegenerative diseases. The molecular steps leading to IL&#8208;1&#946; maturation take place in an intracellular complex termed the inflammasome 38. However, the potential role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the local production of IL&#8208;1&#946; in the brain is not well understood 39, 40. In spite of our results linking acute inflammation and weight loss, it is tempting to speculate a role of NLRP3 inflammasome that would be interested to further investigate.</text>

      <text>The central inflammation was associated with a striking increase in many CCR2 ligands. Among potential candidates, CCL2 was particularly considered, based on (i) its strong brain expression following systemic LPS challenges 25, 26, 41, (ii) its key role in the recruitment of monocytes in the brain 42, 43, and (iii) the fact that both brain inflammation and weight loss following peripheral LPS injection are markedly reduced in CCL2 KO 24, CCR2 KO, and INCB3344&#8208;treated mice (Fig EV2 and Appendix Fig S2). Furthermore, CCL2 and CCR2 are expressed in LHA neurons 22, 44, in contrast to sporadic cytokine receptors expression 13, 14. Therefore, we investigated whether CCL2 would act as intermediate between cytokines and neurons in the cascade linking inflammation to alteration of neuronal networks involved in food behavior. Firstly, its particular kinetics of activation following central LPS injection arises between inflammatory cytokines activation and downregulation of orexigenic peptides, such as MCH and ORX. Secondly, its primary receptor, CCR2 is expressed into MCH&#8208;producing neurons leading to hypothesize that CCL2 could directly modulate MCH neurons activity. Indeed, in mice with genetic or pharmacological CCR2 disruption, ip and icv LPS injections were inefficient in reducing MCH mRNA. Such mandatory effect of CCL2/CCR2 signaling on MCH gene regulation was confirmed by the full reversion of CCL2&#8208;induced MCH mRNA decrease in the CCR2 KO and INCB3344&#8208;treated mice. The 50% reduction in MCH mRNA expression was similarly prevented in both paradigms either under ip or under icv LPS administration (Figs EV2C and 3F). The same responses noted under both types of injection indicate that weight loss following icv LPS administration could not result from a general noxious action.</text>

      <text>CCL2 generates a hyperpolarization blocked by low barium concentration associated with an increase in membrane conductance, characteristic of activation of a GIRK current. This will tend to shunt somatic excitatory currents and block the propagation of excitatory events. Indeed, CCL2, via the direct stimulation of CCR2, depresses the frequency of discharge of evoked APs. Finally, we addressed the effect of CCL2 on the release of MCH induced by KCl&#8208;mediated depolarization 45. We found a drastic reduction in MCH secretion by adding CCL2, an effect fully blocked by the INCB3344 antagonist.</text>

      <text>Intriguingly, further MCH secretion induced by KCl&#8208;mediated depolarization was observed in the only presence of the INCB3344 antagonist (data not shown) suggesting that endogenous CCL2 may also contribute to the strong inhibition of MCH release. As a significant proportion of MCH neurons expresses both CCR2 and CCL2 and could be activated by the general depolarization induced by KCl, the locally expressed chemokine would act as a short&#8208;loop autocrine modulator amplifying the CCL2 responses driven by astrocyte activation 42, 46. Thus, both sources of brain CCL2 are likely to contribute to the inhibition of MCH secretion.</text>

      <text>Prevention of the weight loss induced by LPS by CCR2 antagonist injection or invalidation of the CCR2 gene in transgenic mice was partial and transitory, indicating that there must be other neuronal pathways involved in this action. Indeed, LepR/&#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA)&#8208;expressing neurons have been shown to also regulate body weight: leptin mainly acts on GABAergic neurons to reduce body weight and triggers POMC neuronal activity by reducing GABA release onto these neurons. This suggested a body weight&#8208;promoting role for GABA released from leptin&#8208;inhibited neurons 52, 53, 54. Since ORX neurons do not express CCR2, the few MCH&#8722;/CCR2+ cells we noticed in the LHA could be related to LepR/GABA neuronal pathway. Importantly, MCH neurons are located in the LHA which is known to be a pre&#8208;ganglionic structure whose output directly affects neurons controlling autonomic output, which in turn controls peripheral substrate utilization 55. Hence, MCH neurons could relay two of the main adaptive responses triggered by central inflammation, that is, reduction in appetite and loss of fat stores through enhanced fat oxidation. Paradoxically, CCR2 signaling is involved in metabolic disorders associated with obesity 56 as underlined by its role in the hyperphagic response to a high&#8208;fat diet (HFD) 57, as another chemokine system, the CXCL12/CXCR4 system. Thus, these chemokine systems may have a role in mediating both neuronal and behavioral effects induced by a HFD 58. Nevertheless, a low&#8208;grade inflammation both in the CNS and at the periphery is associated with obesity 59, 60, while sickness response is associated with high&#8208;grade inflammation (explored here), eliciting different inflammatory signaling in the CNS 61. Therefore, resolving the paradox about the central effects of CCR2 signaling would require evaluating the response of MCH neurons under conditions that promote either positive or negative energy balance.</text>

      <text>In summary, our results demonstrate that brain LPS injection drives CCL2 synthesis that could lead to inhibition of MCH neuron activity through selective CCR2 signaling and subsequently decreases body weight/food intake. This represents the first evidence that a chemokine may directly affect a major orexigenic pathway to contribute to modulate a cardinal response of the sickness behavior.</text>

      <text>After 48&#8208;h acclimatization in calorimetric cages, non&#8208;restrained and conscious mice were weighted and perfused icv by using a catheter connected to the injector inserted into the guide cannula. This catheter was connected to a Hamilton syringe powered by a mini&#8208;pump KDS310 (KD Scientific, Holliston, MA, USA). Mice were accustomed to the operator by frequent handling before the experiment. The first 2 days of the experiment, all mice were perfused with vehicle solution (NaCl, Lavoisier, France) just before the onset of the dark period (18:00 pm; Vt = 2.5 &#956;l; 1 &#956;l/min) for habituation. At the 3rd day of the experiment, mice were divided into three groups and injected either with vehicle solution, LPS (500 ng; Vt: 5 &#956;l), or LPS+INCB3344 (LPS: 500 ng + INCB3344: 10 &#956;M; Vt: 5 &#956;l) at a rate of 1 &#956;l/min just before the onset of the dark period (18:00 pm). The group injected with LPS + INCB3344 was pre&#8208;injected with INCB3344 alone (10 &#956;M; Vt: 5 &#956;l; 1 &#956;l/min) one hour before (17:00 pm). Mice were monitored in calorimetric cages for 45 h after those injections.</text>

      <text>Mice were analyzed for whole energy expenditure (EE), oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production, respiratory exchange rate (RER, CO2/O2), food intake (g) and locomotors activity (beambreak/h) using calorimetric cages with bedding, food, and water (Labmaster, TSE Systems GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany) as described by Joly&#8208;Amado et al64. Fatty acid oxidation was compiled as described by Bruss et al65.</text>

      <text>Data obtained following icv injections were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 6 using Student's unpaired two&#8208;tailed t&#8208;test. The threshold for significance was P &lt; 0.05. For electrophysiology experiments, ANOVA test was used to analyze the differences between groups, followed by a Student's Newman&#8211;Keuls post hoc test with a threshold of significance of P &lt; 0.05 using a statistical software package (SigmaStat 2.03, Jandel Sci). For indirect calorimetric studies, the results are expressed as mean &#177; SEM. Variance equality was analyzed by Microsoft Excel's F&#8208;test, and comparisons between groups were carried out using a Student's t&#8208;test or by a nonparametric Mann&#8211;Whitney U&#8208;test/Wilcoxon's test. When appropriate, analyses of variances were performed followed by a Tukey's post hoc test with the appropriate parameters and their interaction as factor. Data with different superscripts letters (a,b,c) differ significantly (P &lt; 0.05).</text>
