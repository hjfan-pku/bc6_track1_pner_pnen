      <text>Condensins associate with DNA and shape mitotic chromosomes. Condensins are enriched nearby highly expressed genes during mitosis, but how this binding is achieved and what features associated with transcription attract condensins remain unclear. Here, we report that condensin accumulates at or in the immediate vicinity of nucleosome&#8208;depleted regions during fission yeast mitosis. Two transcriptional coactivators, the Gcn5 histone acetyltransferase and the RSC chromatin&#8208;remodelling complex, bind to promoters adjoining condensin&#8208;binding sites and locally evict nucleosomes to facilitate condensin binding and allow efficient mitotic chromosome condensation. The function of Gcn5 is closely linked to condensin positioning, since neither the localization of topoisomerase II nor that of the cohesin loader Mis4 is altered in gcn5 mutant cells. We propose that nucleosomes act as a barrier for the initial binding of condensin and that nucleosome&#8208;depleted regions formed at highly expressed genes by transcriptional coactivators constitute access points into chromosomes where condensin binds free genomic DNA.</text>

      <text>In most eukaryotes, chromatin fibres metamorphose into compact and individualized rod&#8208;shaped chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis. This profound reorganization, called chromosome condensation, is a strict prerequisite for the accurate segregation of chromosomes. From yeasts to human, chromosome condensation relies upon condensin complexes and topoisomerase II&#8208;&#945; (Topo II). It is widely accepted that Topo II ensures decatenation of sister chromatids and chromosomes (Baxter et&#160;al, 2011; Charbin et&#160;al, 2014). In contrast, how condensins reconfigure chromosome structure in a cell cycle&#8208;regulated manner remains poorly understood.</text>

      <text>Condensins are ring&#8208;shaped ATPases that belong to the family of SMC (Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes) protein complexes, which also include cohesin, responsible for sister chromatid cohesion, and the Smc5/Smc6 complex, which is implicated in DNA damage repair (Thadani et&#160;al, 2012; Aragon et&#160;al, 2013; Hirano, 2016). Eukaryotic condensins are composed of the Smc2 and Smc4 ATPase subunits, called Cut14 and Cut3 in fission yeast, and three non&#8208;SMC subunits. Smc2 and Smc4 form a V&#8208;shaped heterodimer in which two ATPase heads face each other at the apices of two 50&#8208;nm&#8208;long coiled&#8208;coil arms. A kleisin subunit (called Cnd2 in fission yeast) associates with the ATPase heads, thereby creating a tripartite ring&#8208;like structure, and recruits two HEAT&#8208;repeat containing subunits. Most eukaryotes possess two condensins, called condensin I and II, which are made of the same Smc2/Smc4 heterodimer but contain different sets of the three non&#8208;SMC subunits. Budding and fission yeasts possess a single condensin complex, which is similar to condensin I by protein sequence. Condensin II is nuclear throughout the cell cycle and accumulates on chromosomes at the beginning of prophase. In contrast, condensin I is cytoplasmic during interphase and gains access to chromosomes only from prometaphase to telophase (Ono et&#160;al, 2003; Hirota et&#160;al, 2004). Fission yeast condensin shows a similar localization pattern as condensin I, with the bulk of the complexes binding chromosomes from prophase to telophase (Sutani et&#160;al, 1999). However, a fraction seems to persist on chromosomes during interphase (Aono et&#160;al, 2002; Nakazawa et&#160;al, 2015).</text>

      <text>Studies performed in a wide range of systems have substantiated the idea that condensins modify the topology of chromosomal DNA by introducing positive supercoils (Kimura &amp; Hirano, 1997), by topological entrapment of DNA molecules within their ring&#8208;like structure (Cuylen et&#160;al, 2011) and/or by promoting the re&#8208;annealing of unwound genomic DNA segments (Sutani et&#160;al, 2015). It remains unclear, however, to what extent each of these molecular activities contribute to the shaping of chromosomes. Equally unclear is how condensins associate with and manipulate chromosomal DNA in the intricate context of the chromatin fibre.</text>

      <text>From yeasts to mammals, condensins are enriched at centromeres, telomeres and, along chromosome arms, nearby genes that are highly transcribed by either of the three RNA polymerases (D'Ambrosio et&#160;al, 2008; Schmidt et&#160;al, 2009; Dowen et&#160;al, 2013; Kim et&#160;al, 2013; Kranz et&#160;al, 2013; Nakazawa et&#160;al, 2015; Sutani et&#160;al, 2015). Several factors have been implicated in the recruitment of condensins along chromosomes. In budding yeast, the cohesin loading factor Scc2/4 has been reported to promote the full level of association of condensin at tRNA genes and at genes encoding ribosomal proteins (D'Ambrosio et&#160;al, 2008). The replication fork blocking protein Fob1, in a complex with the monopolin subunits Csm1 and Lrs4, recruits condensin at rDNA repeats (Johzuka &amp; Horiuchi, 2009). Fission yeast monopolin associates with condensin and contributes to its localization at the rDNA repeats and also at the kinetochore, but plays no role along chromosome arms (Tada et&#160;al, 2011). In chicken DT40 cells, the chromokinesin Kif4 has been implicated in the localization of condensins (mostly condensin I) along the longitudinal axes of mitotic chromosomes (Samejima et&#160;al, 2012). In human cells, the zinc finger protein AKAP95 directly interacts with the kleisin CAP&#8208;H and takes part in the recruitment of condensin I onto chromatin (Steen et&#160;al, 2000; Eide et&#160;al, 2002). More recently, it has been reported that condensins I and II bind the N&#8208;terminal tail of histones H2A and H4, respectively (Liu et&#160;al, 2010; Tada et&#160;al, 2011). However, contacts with histones do not explain the pattern of condensins along chromosomes, and contrasting results have been obtained regarding the role played by histone tails, if any, in the chromosomal association of condensin I (Tada et&#160;al, 2011; Shintomi et&#160;al, 2015). Thus, the mechanisms through which condensins associate with chromatin remain unclear.</text>

      <text>The enrichment of condensin nearby highly expressed genes suggests a crucial link between the localization of condensins and a feature associated with high transcription levels. In line with this, chemical inhibition of RNA Pol II reduces condensin association with mitotic chromosomes during early mitosis in fission yeast (Sutani et&#160;al, 2015), and transcription factors have been implicated in the loading of condensin (D'Ambrosio et&#160;al, 2008; Iwasaki et&#160;al, 2015; Nakazawa et&#160;al, 2015). Paradoxically, transcription of DNA repeats by RNA Pol I or Pol II obstructs the stable association of condensin in budding yeast (Johzuka &amp; Horiuchi, 2007; Clemente&#8208;Blanco et&#160;al, 2009, 2011). Fission yeast condensin appears excluded from gene bodies and accumulates towards the 3&#8242; ends of highly expressed genes (Nakazawa et&#160;al, 2015; Sutani et&#160;al, 2015). Moreover, transcription by all three RNA Pols is usually repressed during mitosis in most eukaryotes (Gottesfeld &amp; Forbes, 1997), when the association of condensin with chromosomes reaches its maximum. In budding yeast, the inhibition of RNA Pol I and Pol II by the Cdc14 phosphatase during anaphase is necessary for condensin binding (Clemente&#8208;Blanco et&#160;al, 2009, 2011). Thus, the association of condensin with chromatin appears both positively and negatively linked with transcription. What remains unclear, however, is the molecular determinant(s) that defines condensin association sites and what feature(s) associated with transcription takes part in condensin binding.</text>

      <text>Active gene promoters are associated with histone H3 acetylated at lysines 9 and 14 (H3K9ac and H3K14ac) (Pokholok et&#160;al, 2005; Roh et&#160;al, 2005; Wiren et&#160;al, 2005). Although the bulk of chromatin is deacetylated during mitosis in mammals (Kruhlak et&#160;al, 2001; Patzlaff et&#160;al, 2010), traces of H3K9ac and H3K14ac persist at some gene promoters (Wang &amp; Higgins, 2013). Gcn5 is the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) subunit of the SAGA complex, an evolutionarily conserved modular transcription coactivator that acetylates nucleosomes, notably H3K9, H3K14 and H3K18 (Koutelou et&#160;al, 2010; Weake &amp; Workman, 2012). Gcn5&#8208;containing SAGA occupies the promoters and coding regions of active genes. At promoters, Gcn5 occupancy increases with transcription rate (Robert et&#160;al, 2004; Govind et&#160;al, 2007; Johnsson et&#160;al, 2009; Xue&#8208;Franzen et&#160;al, 2013; Bonnet et&#160;al, 2014). By acetylating nucleosomes, SAGA promotes the local formation of an &#8220;open&#8221; chromatin structure where the transcription pre&#8208;initiation complex assembles.</text>

      <text>Using fission yeast as a model system, we show that condensin binding to chromosomes and mitotic chromosome condensation rely upon Gcn5 HAT activity. Although the majority of Gcn5 is transiently displaced from chromosomes in early mitosis and the bulk of chromatin is deacetylated, Gcn5 and acetylated H3 persist at promoters adjoining a number of highly expressed genes. There, Gcn5 and the ATP&#8208;dependent chromatin&#8208;remodelling complex RSC (remodels the structure of chromatin) evict nucleosomes and promote the efficient binding of condensin at these nucleosome&#8208;depleted regions. Our results suggest that nucleosomes constitute a barrier for the localization of condensin, which is overcome by Gcn5&#8208;mediated histone acetylation and chromatin remodelling. Besides providing unanticipated insights into the mechanism of condensin binding to chromatin, our study suggests that the presence of exposed, non&#8208;nucleosomal DNA may be an important feature that attracts condensins to highly expressed genes in eukaryotes.</text>

      <text>Fission yeast cells carrying the thermosensitive cut3&#8208;477 mutation in the Smc4 condensin subunit cease to divide at 36&#176;C, but continue to proliferate at the semi permissive temperature of 32&#176;C, even though condensin binding to chromosomes is reduced and mitotic chromosome condensation is partly impaired (Saka et&#160;al, 1994; Tada et&#160;al, 2011; Robellet et&#160;al, 2014). To identify the factors that collaborate with condensin, we screened for mutations synthetically lethal with cut3&#8208;477 at 32&#176;C (Robellet et&#160;al, 2014). We isolated gcn5&#8208;47, a nonsense G765A mutation in the gcn5 open reading frame that is predicted to eliminate the C&#8208;terminal bromodomain of the protein (Fig&#160;1A and B). Deletion of the complete gcn5 open reading frame was also colethal with cut3&#8208;477 at 32&#176;C (Fig&#160;1A) and with the top2&#8208;250 allele of Topo II (Appendix&#160;Fig S1A). In sharp contrast, neither gcn5&#8208;47 nor gcn5&#916; lowered the restrictive temperature of mutations eso1&#8208;H17 and rad21&#8208;K1, which affect sister&#8208;chromatid cohesion (Appendix&#160;Fig S1B). This indicates that lack of Gcn5 function does not confer a blind hypersensitivity to any perturbation in the structure of chromosomes. Thus, Gcn5 interacts positively and specifically with key chromosome condensation factors.</text>

      <text>To assess whether Gcn5 plays a role in mitotic chromosome condensation, we used a quantitative condensation assay that measures the three dimensional distances between two fluorescently labelled loci located on the left arm of chromosome I as cells pass through mitosis (Petrova et&#160;al, 2013). In wild&#8208;type cells, the distance between two loci separated by 0.5 or 1.0&#160;Mb of DNA decreased about twofold from G2 phase until late anaphase (Fig&#160;1C). In gcn5&#8208;47 mutant cells, the distances between the two loci combinations remained larger throughout the mitotic time course (Fig&#160;1C), even though condensation was not as severely affected as in the cut14&#8208;208 condensin mutant. The distances between the fluorescently labelled loci were also slightly enlarged during interphase in gcn5&#8208;47 cells (Fig&#160;1C). Reduced acetylation of nucleosomes might relax chromatin fibres during interphase. Alternatively, or additionally, lack of Gcn5 might impair condensin&#8208;mediated chromosome shaping throughout the cell cycle.</text>

      <text>Consistent with impaired condensation, gcn5&#8208;47 mutant cells exhibited frequent chromatin bridges or chromatin trailing in anaphase (Fig&#160;1D) and failed to efficiently disentangle the rDNA repeats located on the arms of chromosome III (Fig&#160;EV1). These phenotypes are frequently observed as a consequence of defects in mitotic chromosome condensation (Tada et&#160;al, 2011), for example in the cut3&#8208;477 condensin mutant (Figs&#160;1D and EV1). However, most chromatin bridges disappeared during late anaphase B in gcn5&#8208;47 mutant cells, unlike in the more severe cut3&#8208;477 mutant. Plotting the number of chromatin bridges as a function of spindle length suggested that chromosome arms eventually achieved complete separation in gcn5&#8208;47 cells, at a time when the mitotic spindle was 25% longer compared to wild&#8208;type cells (Fig&#160;1E). Taken together, these data indicate that Gcn5 is required for the efficient condensation of chromosome arms during mitosis. Because condensation is&#160;partly impaired in the absence of Gcn5 function, the complete separation of chromosome arms necessitates a longer mitotic spindle.</text>

      <text>The function of Gcn5 as a transcriptional coactivator raised the possibility that its effect on chromosome condensation might be indirect, that is that Gcn5 controls the transcription of a bona fide condensation factor. However, our data suggest that this is unlikely. The mRNA levels of Topo II and all five condensin subunits were not notably reduced in gcn5&#8208;47 or gcn5&#916; cells (Fig&#160;EV2A), nor were Cut3, Cnd2 or Topo II protein levels (Fig&#160;EV2B and C). Moreover, efficient co&#8208;immunoprecipitation of Cut3&#8208;HA with Cnd2&#8208;GFP suggested that the integrity of the condensin complex was not affected in the absence of Gcn5 (Fig&#160;EV2C). We also re&#8208;analysed available transcriptome data for wild&#8208;type and gcn5&#916; mutant cells (Helmlinger et&#160;al, 2008) by comparing the mRNA levels of 236 genes that have been reported in pombase (www.pombase.org) to be required for chromosome segregation and/or condensation, or to genetically or physically interact with condensin. Using a threshold of at least 1.5&#8208;fold up&#8208; or downregulation, we found a single hit: the cnp3 gene, which encodes a centromeric protein (Fig&#160;EV2D). However, restoring the level of cnp3 mRNA by ectopic expression did not suppress the colethality between gcn5&#8208;47 and cut3&#8208;477 at 32&#176;C (Fig&#160;EV2E and F), indicating that the functional interaction between Gcn5 and condensin was independent of cnp3. We conclude that Gcn5 plays a genuine role in mitotic chromosome condensation.</text>

      <text>The Gcn5&#8208;containing SAGA complex consists of three independent functional modules (Weake &amp; Workman, 2012; see Fig&#160;2A): the HAT module, which is composed of Gcn5, Ada2 and Ada3, the Spt module, which includes the Spt8 subunit implicated in the recruitment of the TATA&#8208;binding protein to certain promoters, and the ubiquitin protease module, which contains Sgf11 and Sgf73. To test whether SAGA components other than Gcn5 genetically interact with condensin, we combined deletions of representative subunits of each of the three modules with cut3&#8208;477 (Fig&#160;2A). Lack of the ada2 or ada3 subunits of the HAT module was colethal with cut3&#8208;477 at 32&#176;C, but deletion of subunits of the two other modules had no effect. This finding strongly suggests that condensin is closely linked to the Gcn5 HAT activity. We confirmed this conclusion by testing the catalytically inactive gcn5&#8208;E191Q mutant (Helmlinger et&#160;al, 2008) (Fig&#160;2B).</text>

      <text>Different HATs can have overlapping functions and Mst2 and Elp3 are partially redundant with Gcn5 (Nugent et&#160;al, 2010). Of five additional HATs&#8212;Hat1, Naa40, Rtt109, Mst2 and Elp3&#8212;tested, none showed an obvious negative genetic interaction with cut3&#8208;477 (Fig&#160;2C). However, simultaneous deletion of Mst2 and Gcn5 reduced viability of the cut3&#8208;477 mutant even further than depletion of Gcn5 alone, which suggests that the two HATs might be partially redundant (Fig&#160;2D). Thus, Gcn5 functionally interacts with condensin through its acetyltransferase activity, possibly in the context of the SAGA complex, and Mst2 is partly redundant with Gcn5 for this function.</text>

      <text>To test whether Gcn5 and Mst2 might affect the association of condensin with chromosomes, we assessed chromosomal condensin levels using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) against the kleisin subunit Cnd2 tagged with GFP. Previous genomewide mapping experiments have shown that the condensin&#8208;binding profile along chromosome arms in mitosis consists of low&#8208;occupancy binding sites and hot spots of association, which correlate with highly expressed genes (D'Ambrosio et&#160;al, 2008; Schmidt et&#160;al, 2009; Nakazawa et&#160;al, 2015; Sutani et&#160;al, 2015). We quantified Cnd2&#8208;GFP binding using qPCR at the kinetochore (cnt1), pericentric heterochromatin (dh1) and 14 loci along chromosome arms that represent 9 high&#8208;occupancy and 5 low&#8208;occupancy binding sites. Since highly expressed genes can be vulnerable to misleading ChIP enrichments (Teytelman et&#160;al, 2013), we first verified that the association of Cnd2&#8208;GFP with these genes was reduced in the condensin mutant cut3&#8208;477 (Fig&#160;EV3A&#8211;C), as we would expect for bona fide condensin&#8208;binding sites. We then arrested wild&#8208;type or gcn5 mutant cells in pro/metaphase by the nda3&#8208;KM311 tubulin mutation and determined the chromosomal association of Cnd2&#8208;GFP by ChIP. In cells lacking Gcn5, binding of Cnd2&#8208;GFP was significantly reduced at the kinetochore domain and at all high&#8208;occupancy condensin&#8208;binding sites (Fig&#160;3A). ChIP signals were even further decreased in cells lacking both Gcn5 and Mst2 (Fig&#160;3A). The reduced ChIP signals were not due to a decrease in Cnd2&#8208;GFP protein levels in gcn5&#916; mst2&#916; cells (Fig&#160;3B). In sharp contrast, Cnd2&#8208;GFP occupancy at pericentric heterochromatin (dh1) and at all low&#8208;occupancy condensin&#8208;binding sites remained unchanged.</text>

      <text>To assess the total levels of chromosome&#8208;bound condensin, we measured the amount of Cut3&#8208;HA on mitotic chromosome spreads. To identify mitotic chromosomes, we used Dam1&#8208;GFP, which is recruited to kinetochores specifically during mitosis (Liu et&#160;al, 2005). Cut3&#8208;HA was markedly enriched on chromosomes positive for Dam1&#8208;GFP in wild&#8208;type cells (Fig&#160;3C). The amount of Cut3&#8208;HA bound to mitotic chromosomes was reduced by ~30% in the absence of Gcn5 and by ~40% in the absence of both Gcn5 and Mst2, even though total Cut3&#8208;HA protein levels were not reduced (Fig&#160;3D). This result confirms the ChIP experiment and, importantly, rules out the possibility that condensin merely relocates from its canonical high&#8208;occupancy binding sites in the absence of Gcn5 and Mst2. Moreover, we observed no reduction in the association of Topo II or the cohesin loader Mis4 with mitotic chromosomes of gcn5&#916; mst2&#916; cells (Fig&#160;EV4), which reinforces the conclusion that Gcn5 is specifically linked to condensin. Together, these data indicate that Gcn5 and Mst2 specifically assist condensin binding to mitotic chromosomes at core centromeres and at its high&#8208;occupancy sites near genes highly transcribed by RNA Pol II.</text>

      <text>To investigate how Gcn5 could act to regulate condensin binding during mitosis, we assessed transcription of condensin&#8208;binding sites by RNA Pol II, since active transcription is believed to antagonize condensin binding (Johzuka &amp; Horiuchi, 2007; Clemente&#8208;Blanco et&#160;al, 2009, 2011). We observed no increase in the occupancy of transcriptionally engaged RNA Pol II throughout condensin&#8208;binding sites during mitosis in the absence of Gcn5 or both Gcn5 and Mst2 (Fig&#160;EV3D and E), arguing against this possibility. Next, we investigated the localization of Gcn5 during mitosis. Immunofluorescence studies have shown that Gcn5 dissociates from mitotic chromosomes in vertebrate cells (Orpinell et&#160;al, 2010). Using chromosome spreading, we measured the amount of Gcn5&#8208;myc and Cut14&#8208;HA (condensin) on interphase and mitotic chromosomes (Fig&#160;4A). We categorized spread nuclei as interphase, prophase or prometaphase/metaphase by judging the Cut14&#8208;HA/DAPI ratio. We detected less Gcn5 associated with prophase chromosomes as compared to interphase chromosomes, but levels on prometaphase/metaphase chromosomes were comparable to those of interphase ones. These results imply that Gcn5 might only temporarily dissociate from chromosomes during entry into mitosis but then re&#8208;associate at a time when condensin levels further increase. We confirmed by ChIP the presence of Gcn5 on mitotic chromosomes by comparing Gcn5&#8208;myc levels at promoters adjoining condensin&#8208;binding sites in asynchronous cells (80% of which are in G2) and cells arrested in pro/metaphase (Fig&#160;4B). 5 promoters were chosen among high&#8208;occupancy condensin&#8208;binding sites and 4 among low&#8208;occupancy binding sites. In asynchronous cells, we detected Gcn5 in variable amounts at all promoters. In cells arrested in mitosis, the levels of promoter&#8208;bound Gnc5 were considerably higher at all condensin high&#8208;occupancy sites compared to condensin low&#8208;occupancy sites. Remarkably, Gcn5 binding decreased at all low&#8208;occupancy sites during mitosis. In sharp contrast, Gcn5 levels remained unchanged or even increased at all promoters adjoining high&#8208;occupancy sites (Fig&#160;4B), where condensin binding depends on functional Gcn5 (Fig&#160;3A). Whether Gcn5 occupancy increases or drops at promoters during mitosis is therefore linked to condensin occupancy, but unrelated to its absolute binding levels in interphase (compare Gcn5&#8208;myc levels at the slp1 high&#8208;occupancy binding site to the four low&#8208;occupancy sites, Fig&#160;4B). Despite its enrichment at promoters, we failed to detect Gcn5&#8208;myc within adjacent gene bodies or at their 3&#8242; ends during mitosis (Fig&#160;EV5A), which might reflect a more dynamic association of Gcn5 with transcribed regions (Bonnet et&#160;al, 2014). These data suggest that Gcn5 is specifically retained or even enriched during mitosis at promoters adjoining high&#8208;occupancy condensin association sites, where condensin binding in return relies upon Gcn5.</text>

      <text>To explore the state of chromatin at these promoters, we monitored H3K9ac, H3K18ac and H3K14ac in asynchronous and mitotic cells. Reminiscent of mammalian cells, the bulk of H3K9ac and H3K18ac was reduced in fission yeast cells arrested in pro/metaphase, whilst steady&#8208;state levels of H3K14ac remained unaltered (Fig&#160;4C). We used ChIP to assess whether traces of H3K9ac and H3K18ac might persist at condensin&#8208;binding sites co&#8208;occupied by Gcn5. To control for nucleosome occupancy, we performed in parallel ChIP against total H3 using an antibody directed against the C&#8208;terminal part of H3 (H3&#8208;Ct) and determined the amount of acetylated H3 (H3ac) as a ratio of H3ac/H3&#8208;Ct in cells arrested in mitosis (Fig&#160;4D and E). We found that H3K9ac and H3K18ac levels at promoters correlated with the occupancy of Gcn5, being markedly enriched at the promoters of high&#8208;occupancy condensin&#8208;binding sites when compared to the heterochromatic dh1 site used as negative control (Fig&#160;4E). H3K9ac and H3K18ac were also detected at promoters of low&#8208;occupancy condensin&#8208;binding sites, but acetylation ratios were considerably lower. Moreover, Gcn5 was required for the enrichment of H3K9ac and H3K18ac at all promoters tested (Fig&#160;4E). Deletion of Mst2 did not further reduce H3K9ac and H3K18ac, indicating that these histone modifications were mostly deposited by Gcn5. H3K14ac was also present at promoters in mitosis, but, unlike for H3K9ac and H3K18ac, levels were regulated by both Gcn5 and Mst2 (Fig&#160;EV5B). Taken together, these data suggest that the bulk of Gcn5 dissociates from chromosomes during prophase, but a fraction of Gcn5 persists at, or is recruited during prometaphase to, promoters adjoining RNA Pol II&#8208;transcribed genes that are strongly co&#8208;occupied by condensin, where it ensures the persistence of histone acetylation.</text>

      <text>Given that Gcn5 takes part in the eviction of nucleosomes at active genes (Govind et&#160;al, 2007; Xue&#8208;Franzen et&#160;al, 2013), we reasoned that Gcn5 might assist condensin association during mitosis by controlling nucleosome occupancy. To test this idea, we arrested cells in pro/metaphase (Fig&#160;5A) and assessed nucleosome occupancy at condensin&#8208;binding sites by MNase digestion of mitotic chromatin (Figs&#160;5A and EV6A) and massive parallel sequencing of the resulting mononucleosomal DNA fragments (MNase&#8208;seq). We considered as nucleosome&#8208;depleted regions (NDRs) any chromosomal region of at least 150&#160;bp in length exhibiting a normalized MNase&#8208;seq coverage depth smaller than 0.4 (Soriano et&#160;al, 2013). With those settings, we identified 6,816&#160;&#177;&#160;732 NDRs of an average size of 275&#160;&#177;&#160;6&#160;bp (n&#160;=&#160;3 replicates, see Dataset EV1). Given the enrichment of Gcn5 at gene promoters, we assessed nucleosome occupancy upstream of transcription start sites (TSS) of genes bound by condensin. We found that all the 47 high&#8208;occupancy condensin&#8208;binding sites overlapping with Pol II&#8208;transcribed genes, identified by Sutani et&#160;al (2015), were situated in the immediate vicinity of a NDR preceding a TSS (Figs&#160;5B, EV6B and EV7, and Dataset EV1). Moreover, 40 out of these 47 high&#8208;occupancy condensin&#8208;binding sites clearly overlapped with NDRs located at the 3&#8242; end of Pol II genes (Figs&#160;5B, EV6B and EV7, and Dataset EV1). Permutation tests confirmed that the colocalization was highly statistically significant (Fig&#160;5C). Furthermore, by re&#8208;assigning all the reads from condensin ChIP&#8208;seq experiments (Sutani et&#160;al, 2015) to NDR versus non&#8208;NDR DNA sequences, we found NDR DNA sequences specifically enriched in the fraction co&#8208;immunoprecipitated with condensin (Fig&#160;EV6B). This suggests that the vast majority of condensin&#8208;binding sites, and not solely the high&#8208;occupancy ones, overlaps with an NDR and/or resides in the immediate vicinity of an NDR.</text>

      <text>The nucleosome pattern significantly changed in gcn5 mutant cells. We analysed nucleosome occupancy at promoters upstream of the 47 condensin&#8208;binding sites and at the 40 NDRs covered by condensin at the 3&#8242; end of genes. In both cases, we found that nucleosome occupancy increased within the core of the NDR and that the positioning of the two nucleosomes delimitating the NDR also markedly increased (Figs&#160;5B, D and E, and EV7). Again, we observed a cumulative effect of gcn5&#916; and mst2&#916; mutations. We confirmed the increased nucleosome occupancy and the cumulative effect by MNase&#8208;qPCR (Fig&#160;EV6C) and by ChIP against histone H3 (Fig&#160;5F). Note that nucleosome occupancy appeared unchanged at the 5S rRNA, cnd1 and uge1 genes in cells lacking Gcn5 or both Gcn5 and Mst2 (Figs&#160;5F and EV6D), where the binding of condensin remained unchanged (Fig&#160;3A). These data indicate that Gcn5 and Mst2 collaborate during mitosis to evict nucleosomes from NDRs, both at gene promoters and at the 3&#8242; end of genes, which constitute high&#8208;occupancy condensin&#8208;binding sites.</text>

      <text>If nucleosome eviction were important for condensin binding, then increasing nucleosome occupancy by means other than Gcn5 or Mst2 inactivation should similarly reduce condensin binding. Arp9 and Snf21 are two subunits of RSC (remodels the structure of chromatin), an ATP&#8208;dependent chromatin&#8208;remodelling complex that evicts nucleosome from promoters (Monahan et&#160;al, 2008; Lorch et&#160;al, 2014). We had previously identified arp9&#8208;127 and snf21&#8208;129 loss&#8208;of&#8208;function mutations by screening for synthetic lethality with cut3&#8208;477 at 32&#176;C (Robellet et&#160;al, 2014). We therefore asked whether RSC could regulate condensin binding to chromosomes during mitosis through its function as nucleosome remodeller. We arrested wild&#8208;type, arp9&#916; and snf21&#8208;129 cells in mitosis (Fig&#160;6A) and processed chromatin for simultaneous ChIPs against histones H3, H4 and Cnd2&#8208;GFP. We found that the occupancy of H3 and H4 increased at the promoters of both condensin high&#8208;occupancy (prl53, exg1, ecm33, cdc22, slp1 and snoU14) and low&#8208;occupancy (5S and gly05) sites in the arp9&#916; and snf21&#8208;129 mutants (Fig&#160;6B). The occupancy of histone H3 increased also at the 3&#8242; end of some but not all tested genes, although the effects were less dramatic (Fig&#160;EV8). This suggests that RSC evicts nucleosomes mainly at a&#160;broad range of gene promoters. Remarkably, the binding of Cnd2&#8208;GFP in the arp9&#916; and snf21&#8208;129 mutants concomitantly dropped at all condensin&#8208;binding sites, including 5S and gly05, although the reductions were much less dramatic at these sites compared to the other sites (Fig&#160;6C). Note that the steady&#8208;state level of Cnd2&#8208;GFP remained unaffected in the arp9&#916; or snf21&#8208;129 genetic background (Fig&#160;6D). These data strongly support the conclusion that nucleosome eviction facilitates condensin binding during mitosis.</text>

      <text>Given that the bromodomain&#8208;containing Snf21 protein binds H3K14ac (Wang et&#160;al, 2012), we asked whether Gcn5 and Mst2 might recruit RSC at condensin&#8208;binding sites in mitosis. Even though binding of chromatin remodellers is notoriously difficult to assay by ChIP, we detected Snf21&#8208;flag at promoters upstream of condensin&#8208;binding sites in cells arrested in mitosis (Fig&#160;6E and F). The association of Snf21 at the promoter of snoU14 was reduced in cells lacking Gcn5 or both Gcn5 and Mst2, but remained unchanged at the seven other tested condensin&#8208;binding sites. Thus, RSC is present during mitosis at gene promoters adjoining condensin&#8208;binding sites and its localization near most, but not all, of these sites is independent of Gcn5 and Mst2.</text>

      <text>Condensin binding to DNA is instrumental for chromosome condensation, but how binding is achieved in the context of a chromatin environment has remained elusive. Here, we provide evidence that nucleosome eviction, promoted by the histone acetyltransferases Gcn5 and Mst2 as well as the RSC chromatin&#8208;remodelling complex, is necessary for condensin binding to chromosomes during mitosis and for proper mitotic chromosome condensation. Thus, nucleosomes must constitute a barrier for the association of condensin. Nucleosome&#8208;depleted regions generated at least in part by transcription cofactors, such as Gcn5, Mst2 and RSC, might therefore constitute access points into the chromosome where condensin first associates with exposed double&#8208;stranded DNA helices.</text>

      <text>One key finding of our study is the preferred localization of condensin at or in the immediate vicinity of NDRs (Figs&#160;5B and EV6). This is particularly true for high&#8208;occupancy condensin&#8208;binding sites (see Fig&#160;5B and C). In itself, this pattern of localization suggests that nucleosomes constitute an obstacle for the localization of condensin. In the case of transcription, the nucleosome barrier is overcome by histone acetylation and nucleosome removal (Owen&#8208;Hughes &amp; Gkikopoulos, 2012). We found that most Gcn5 transiently dissociates from chromatin during prophase in fission yeast, and that the bulk of H3K9ac and H3K18ac is deacetylated, reminiscent of the chromatin modifications that occurs during mitosis in mammalian cells. However, a fraction of Gcn5 remains on chromosomes during mitosis and is enriched at a number of promoters of Pol II&#8208;transcribed genes. At these sites, Gcn5 maintains acetylation of H3K9 and H3K18 and ensures condensin binding. Thus, nucleosome acetylation by Gcn5 might play a role in regulating condensin association with chromatin in mitosis. The finding that lack of both Gcn5 and Mst2 causes a cumulative reduction of H3K14ac in addition to H3K9ac and H3K18ac, and reduces condensin occupancy further, strengthens this conclusion.</text>

      <text>The acetylation of histone H3 is a transcription conductive modification. Gcn5 and Mst2 may therefore facilitate condensin binding by promoting transcription. Although we cannot formally rule out this possibility, we think this is unlikely, because we identified five out of nine condensin&#8208;binding sites where the association of condensin with chromatin was reduced in the absence of Gcn5 whilst the occupancy of RNA Pol II phosphorylated on serine 2 remained unchanged (see rds1, prl53, ecm33, snoU14 and cdc22 in Figs&#160;3A and EV3D). This suggests that transcription and condensin binding can be uncoupled.</text>

      <text>Acetylated nucleosomes are targeted for removal by bromodomain&#8208;containing nucleosome remodellers (Owen&#8208;Hughes &amp; Gkikopoulos, 2012). In line with this, nucleosome occupancy is increased at 3&#8242; NDRs that overlap with condensin&#8208;binding sites, and at NDR upstream of promoters, in gcn5 mutant cells, and is further increased when both Gcn5 and Mst2 are missing. Crucially, the increase in nucleosome occupancy is accompanied by a proportional reduction in condensin binding. Moreover, increasing nucleosome occupancy by directly altering RSC activity is sufficient to decrease condensin binding. Thus, nucleosome eviction most likely plays a key role in condensin binding to chromatin during mitosis. Although our results do not exclude the possibility that Gcn5 assists condensin binding at least in part by acetylating condensin and/or other non&#8208;histone proteins, they strongly suggest that Gcn5 and Mst2 promote condensin binding in mitosis by evicting nucleosomes from condensin&#8208;binding sites.</text>

      <text>Like Gcn5, RSC is present at promoters adjoining condensin&#8208;binding sites during mitosis and is necessary for condensin binding at the 3&#8242; end of genes. However, RSC deficiency increases nucleosome occupancy strongly at gene promoters but only moderately at the 3&#8242; end of genes (see Figs&#160;6B and EV8). This suggests that nucleosome eviction at gene promoters plays a crucial role in the binding of condensin at the 3&#8242; end of genes. Thus, given the enrichment of Gcn5 at gene promoters, and the physical and functional interactions between condensin and the TATA&#8208;binding protein 1 (Iwasaki et&#160;al, 2015), it is tempting to speculate that condensin rings first associate with chromosomes at promoter NDRs and subsequently translocate towards the 3&#8242; end of genes, as proposed for the related cohesin complex (Lengronne et&#160;al, 2004).</text>

      <text>Chromatin&#8208;modifying activities in addition to the activities of Gcn5, Mst2 and RSC are likely to take part in condensin's binding to chromosomes. Although the vast majority of condensin&#8208;binding sites coincides with NDRs (see Fig&#160;EV6B), Gcn5 and Mst2 seem to assist condensin binding mainly at high&#8208;occupancy sites but play only a negligible role (if any) at low&#8208;occupancy binding sites. RSC, in contrast, seems to play a more general role (Fig&#160;6B and C). The fact that nucleosome residence increases at high&#8208;occupancy condensin&#8208;binding sites in the absence of Gcn5 and Mst2, despite the presence of RSC, implies that Gcn5 and Mst2 promote condensin binding at these sites by recruiting additional chromatin remodellers, which are at least partly redundant with RSC. The recent finding that budding yeast Gcn5 acts cooperatively, and often redundantly, with the Swi/Snf nucleosome remodelling enzyme to evict promoter nucleosomes (Qiu et&#160;al, 2016), supports our conclusion.</text>

      <text>Note, however, that nucleosome depletion is unlikely to drive condensin binding by itself. We identified ~7,000 NDRs in mitotic chromosomes in cells arrested in pro/metaphase, but solely ~400 condensin peaks (48 high and 340 low occupancy) have been identified by ChIP&#8208;seq at a similar cell cycle stage (Sutani et&#160;al, 2015). This suggests the existence of NDRs devoid of condensin during mitosis. The corollary, therefore, is that nucleosome eviction is necessary but not sufficient for condensin binding. Hence, additional features/activities must attract condensin. Budding yeast condensin has been shown to preferentially bind free over nucleosomal DNA in a sequence&#8208;independent manner (Piazza et&#160;al, 2014). It has also been shown that RSC recruits the cohesin loader Scc2/Scc4 complex at NDRs of active promoters in budding yeast (Lopez&#8208;Serra et&#160;al, 2014). The role of nucleosome eviction may therefore be to provide access to free genomic DNA for condensin and/or for DNA binding factors important for condensin association. Also condensin, cohesin and perhaps all SMC complexes may contact and subsequently entrap chromosomal DNA at NDRs.</text>

      <text>Several lines of evidence suggest that the model of condensin loading at NDRs applies to most eukaryotes. In most species, an NDR is present around the transcription start site of active genes (Sadeh &amp; Allis, 2011), the size of which increases with transcription rates to culminate with a disruption of chromatin for the most highly expressed genes (Lantermann et&#160;al, 2010; Soriano et&#160;al, 2013), which are occupied by condensin. Moreover, the fact that nuclease sensitivity patterns are preserved during mitosis suggests that NDRs persist despite transcriptional shut down (Gottesfeld &amp; Forbes, 1997). Thus, the positions of condensins should, in principle, coincide with NDRs at highly expressed genes in a wide range of species. In good agreement, condensin preferentially occupies genes that are co&#8208;occupied by RSC and Gcn5 in budding yeast (Venters et&#160;al, 2011), colocalizes with NDRs at tRNA genes (Piazza et&#160;al, 2014) and relies upon the histone chaperone Asf1 for its chromosomal association, which, together with FACT, regulates nucleosome turnover (Dewari &amp; Bhargava, 2014). Nucleosome remodellers are components of mitotic chromosomes in vertebrates (MacCallum et&#160;al, 2002; Ohta et&#160;al, 2010) and a recent study indicates that the mobilization of embryonic nucleosomes by the histone chaperones Nap1 and FACT is necessary for the assembly of Xenopus mitotic chromosomes (Shintomi et&#160;al, 2015).</text>

      <text>Altogether, those observations are consistent with the idea that nucleosomes constitute a barrier for the initial binding of condensins. The enrichment of condensins nearby highly expressed genes observed from yeasts to mammals may thus reflects the fact that&#160;condensin rings make their first contact with free, exposed chromosomal DNA at nucleosome&#8208;depleted regions created by transcription&#8208;coupled nucleosome eviction.</text>

Gene deletions or tagging were performed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)&#8208;based method (Bahler et&#160;al, 1998). All deletions were confirmed by PCR on genomic DNA. Tagging was validated by Western blotting and Sanger sequencing. Strains used in this study are listed in Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S2.</text>

      <text>Cells were grown at 25&#176;C to 0.5&#8211;1&#160;&#215;&#160;107&#160;cells/ml. Early G2 cells were purified by centrifugation through a 7&#8211;30% (w/v) lactose step gradient and pipetted onto a 35&#8208;mm glass&#8208;bottom dish (MatTek, No 1.5 P35G&#8208;1.5&#8208;10&#8208;C) covered with 2&#160;mg/ml BS1 lectin (Sigma, L2380), and the dish was shifted to 34&#176;C. The glass&#8208;bottom dish was filled with 2&#160;ml YES&#160;+&#160;A pre&#8208;warmed to 34&#176;C and placed onto the sample stage of the microscope. Imaging was performed using a 100&#215; objective (Olympus) on a DeltaVision system equipped with a Photometrics CoolSnap HQ camera (Roper Scientific) binning 2&#160;&#215;&#160;2 pixels. Pixel size was about 130&#160;&#215;&#160;130&#160;nm. A GFP&#8208;DsRed Dual dichroic mirror (art F51&#8208;019) was used in combination with two bandpass filters to switch between excitation bands. Imaging was started 1&#160;h after lactose gradient centrifugation, and Z&#8208;stacks to cover a depth of 400&#160;nm were acquired every 45&#160;s for 6 fields of view (512&#160;&#215;&#160;512 px) for 1&#160;h. Imaging data were analysed by determining foci centroids using a custom ImageJ plugin as described (Petrova et&#160;al, 2013). Anaphase onset was defined as the frame at which the centromere&#8208;proximal foci split. Distance time series were aligned based on anaphase onset. Average and standard deviation were calculated for each time point.</text>

      <text>ChIPs were performed as described (Vanoosthuyse et&#160;al, 2014). About 2&#160;&#215;&#160;108 cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde at 19&#176;C for 30&#160;min, washed with PBS and lysed using acid&#8208;wash glass beads in a Precellys homogenizer (3 times 10&#8243; at full speed with 30&#160;s pauses in ice). Chromatin was sheared in 300&#8208; to 900&#8208;bp fragments by sonication of whole cell extracts at 4&#176;C using a Diagenode bioruptor (10 cycles 30&#160;s on/30&#160;s off), max power. Clarified chromatin was split in two equivalent fractions subjected to parallel immunoprecipitations using magnetic Dynabeads previously incubated with the appropriate antibody. Total and immunoprecipitated DNA was purified using the NucleoSpin PCR clean&#8208;up kit (Macherey&#8208;Nagel). DNA was analysed on a Rotor&#8208;Gene PCR cycler using QuantiFast SYBR Green mix. Primers are listed in Appendix Table&#160;S3.</text>

      <text>MNase digestion of mitotic chromatin was performed as described (Lantermann et&#160;al, 2009) using cells arrested in early mitosis by the nda3&#8208;KM311 mutation at 19&#176;C and cross&#8208;linked with 0.5% formaldehyde for 30&#160;min. Chromatin was digested with increasing amount of MNase to reach a mononucleosome to di&#8208;nucleosome ratio of ~80:20. Mononucleosomal DNA fragments were separated on an agarose gel, extracted from the gel and subjected to massive parallel sequencing on an Illumina NextSeq 500 Apparatus. Between 46,818,494 and 62,258,601 single&#8208;end reads of 75&#160;bp in length were obtained per sample and aligned to the S. pombe genome (Ensembl ASM294v2, May 2009) using Bowtie 2.2.4 with default parameters. Detection of the NDRs was performed as described (Soriano et&#160;al, 2013). Each sample was normalized by dividing signals for every base pair by the mean of coverage depth. NDRs were identified as regions of at least 150&#160;bp in length with normalized sequence coverage inferior to 0.4 and were fused together if separated by &lt;&#160;15&#160;bps.</text>

      <text>For each condensin&#8208;binding site, adjacent NDRs of reference were manually identified and their coordinates determined by an iterative process. Manually identified NDRs were aligned with their respective counterparts calculated for each biological replicate (n&#160;=&#160;3). When the reference NDR was overlapped by at least 70% of its length by its calculated counterpart, the two NDRs were merged, generating a new NDR of reference, which was used for the next iteration. Reference NDRs, and calculated NDRs detected in each replicate, are listed in Dataset EV1. To compare coverage depth (Fig&#160;5E), 200&#8208;bp upstream and 200&#8208;bp downstream of the NDR were added to take into account the flanking nucleosomes. The sum of the normalized coverage depth at each base was calculated and divided by the total length. Resulting distributions were tested for gaussian behaviour using the Shapiro&#8211;Wilk test. The Kruskal&#8211;Wallis test was used for comparison if at least one distribution did not follow the normal law.</text>

      <text>Positions of the 47 condensin peaks were shuffled 100,000 times using the shuffle tool of Bedtools, without any constraint, to obtain a theoretical distribution of the overlaps between condensin peaks and NDRs. The permutation test was performed on this distribution. The P&#8208;value was calculated by dividing the number (x) of permutations giving higher numbers of bases in overlaps than the observed value increased by one (the observed value), by the total number of sets of positions (the set of the observed positions and the 100,000 permutations of the positions): (x&#160;+&#160;1)/(100,000&#160;+&#160;1).</text>

      <text>Datasets of ChIP&#8208;seq against Cut14&#8208;pk9 (Sutani et&#160;al, 2015) n&#176; SRR1564296, SRR1557176, SRR1559300, SRR1559301, SRR1557175 and SRR1557178 were aligned to the S.&#160;pombe genome (Ensembl ASM294v2) using bowtie 1.1.2 with the parameters indicated in the original paper. For each dataset, coverage was divided by a normalization factor, which corresponds to the ratio of the number of alignments over the size of the genome. Note that the length of the reads is unique (48&#160;bp) for all samples. Normalized coverage of the IP sample was divided by the normalized coverage of the corresponding input (both increased by 1 to allow taking into account bases with a coverage value of 0 in the input). Thus, any enrichment gives a ratio &gt;&#160;1, and, reciprocally, any impoverishment gives a ratio between 0 and 1.</text>
