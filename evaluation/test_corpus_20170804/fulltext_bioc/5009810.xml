      <text>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as regulators of gene expression in pathogenesis, including cancer. Recently, lncRNAs have been implicated in progression of specific subtypes of breast cancer. One aggressive, basal&#8208;like subtype associates with increased EGFR signaling, while another, the HER2&#8208;enriched subtype, engages a kin of EGFR. Based on the premise that EGFR&#8208;regulated lncRNAs might control the aggressiveness of basal&#8208;like tumors, we identified multiple EGFR&#8208;inducible lncRNAs in basal&#8208;like normal cells and overlaid them with the transcriptomes of over 3,000 breast cancer patients. This led to the identification of 11 prognostic lncRNAs. Functional analyses of this group uncovered LINC01089 (here renamed LncRNA Inhibiting Metastasis; LIMT), a highly conserved lncRNA, which is depleted in basal&#8208;like and in HER2&#8208;positive tumors, and the low expression of which predicts poor patient prognosis. Interestingly, EGF rapidly downregulates LIMT expression by enhancing histone deacetylation at the respective promoter. We also find that LIMT inhibits extracellular matrix invasion of mammary cells in&#160;vitro and tumor metastasis in&#160;vivo. In conclusion, lncRNAs dynamically regulated by growth factors might act as novel drivers of cancer progression and serve as prognostic biomarkers.</text>

      <text>Growth factors and their receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play major roles in breast cancer progression (Hynes &amp; Watson, 2010; Witsch et&#160;al, 2010). Of the five major breast cancer subtypes represented in the Prediction Analysis of Microarrays (PAM50) subtyping (Parker et&#160;al, 2009), the one overexpressing the RTK called HER2 and the less prevalent, the basal&#8208;like subtype are considered highly aggressive (Perou et&#160;al, 2000). While the former is driven by an amplified HER2 gene, a fraction of the basal subtype is characterized by relatively high abundance of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, a kin of HER2) (Carey et&#160;al, 2010; Foulkes et&#160;al, 2010). In line with driver functions, EGFR&#8208;associated poor prognostic signatures are highly expressed in basal&#8208;like tumors, and blocking EGFR using either kinase inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies effectively retards growth of basal&#8208;like cancer cells (Hoadley et&#160;al, 2007; Ferraro et&#160;al, 2013).</text>

      <text>Using basal&#8208;like untransformed cells, MCF10A, as a model system, data from our laboratory showed that both mRNAs and microRNAs exhibit dynamic changes in expression following EGF stimulation (Amit et&#160;al, 2007; Avraham et&#160;al, 2010; Kostler et&#160;al, 2013). We further demonstrated that the inducible mRNAs and microRNAs are embedded into regulatory subnetworks, which are deregulated in diverse tumor types. Considering the emerging roles for long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in metastasis of breast cancer (Serviss et&#160;al, 2014), we raised the possibility that some EGF&#8208;inducible lncRNAs might play a role in basal&#8208;like breast cancer. LncRNAs are transcripts greater than 200 nucleotides, which lack functional open&#8208;reading frames (Ponting et&#160;al, 2009; Rinn, 2014). They might regulate either local genomic regions (cis&#8208;regulation), which characterizes lncRNA ANRIL, or distant regions of the genome (transregulation), as in the case for lncRNA HOTAIR (Rinn et&#160;al, 2007). In addition, lncRNAs may act as scaffolds or as decoys. These interactions might regulate transcriptional mechanisms, including through epigenetic silencing (Gupta et&#160;al, 2010) or transcription activation (Orom et&#160;al, 2010). LncRNAs might also act post&#8208;transcriptionally, by sequestering microRNAs, or by controlling RNA processing and stability. This large functional diversity underlies the involvement of lncRNAs in a myriad of cellular processes, such as apoptosis (Hung et&#160;al, 2011) and metastasis (Gutschner et&#160;al, 2013).</text>

      <text>In accordance with multiplicity of molecular targets, lncRNAs have been associated with several types of cancer (Gutschner &amp; Diederichs, 2012; Niland et&#160;al, 2012), in which they might act as potential oncogenes or tumor&#8208;suppressor RNAs (Huarte &amp; Rinn, 2010; Gibb et&#160;al, 2011). Moreover, because several lncRNAs can profoundly control transcription, their profiling might assist diagnosis, prognosis, or biomarker identification (Wang et&#160;al, 2011a,b). The involvement of lncRNAs in breast cancer progression is of particular interest (Shore et&#160;al, 2012). In the context of breast cancer, HOTAIR is upregulated in tumors (Gibb et&#160;al, 2011) and its overexpression might serve as an independent predictor of progression&#8208;free survival (Gupta et&#160;al, 2010). Similarly, LSINCT5, a polyadenylated stress&#8208;induced RNA, is overexpressed in breast cancer and affects cellular proliferation (Silva et&#160;al, 2011).</text>

      <text>Since our model of EGF&#8208;stimulated mammary epithelial cells mirrors gene expression patterns in breast cancer patients, it has been employed herein with the aim of uncovering involvement of specific lncRNAs in progression of the basal&#8208;like subtype. To this end, we profiled EGF&#8208;induced changes in expression of lncRNAs and surveyed the prognostic value of individual, EGF&#8208;responsive genes. This led to the identification of a subset of eleven EGF&#8208;regulated lncRNAs, the expression patterns of which could be used to predict survival time of breast cancer patients. In vitro studies of the selected lncRNAs identified LINC01089/LIMT (LncRNA Inhibiting Metastasis), a hitherto uncharacterized EGF&#8208;downregulated lncRNA, as a regulator of mammary cell migration and invasion. Correspondingly, animal studies have shown that depletion of LIMT enhances metastasis formation in&#160;vivo. Importantly, we found that downregulation of LIMT characterizes breast cancer patients diagnosed with either basal&#8208;like or HER2&#8208;enriched tumors. Taken together, these results ascribe potential roles for inducible lncRNAs like LIMT in tumor progression.</text>

      <text>To uncover the potential involvement of lncRNAs in breast cancer metastasis, we first studied transcriptional responses of lncRNAs to EGF stimulation. MCF10A human mammary cells were treated with EGF for increasing time intervals (see scheme in Fig&#160;1A). Purified RNA was then used to profile expression of both lncRNAs and mRNAs by means of gene expression microarrays. For each probe, we calculated the change in expression at every time point, relative to time zero (i.e. no EGF stimulation). Our initial survey noted that the overall dynamic range of lncRNAs was smaller than the dynamic range corresponding to mRNAs (i.e. log2 fold change ranged from &#8722;3.67 to 10.36 for mRNAs and from &#8722;2.32 to 6.94 for lncRNAs). Because of the narrower dynamic range of lncRNAs, transcripts were considered dynamic if their fold change was &gt;&#160;1.5 (lncRNAs) or 2 (mRNAs) in at least one time point relative to time zero. Accordingly, the expression of 346 lncRNAs was affected by EGF (Fig&#160;1B, left panel). Clustering the responsive lncRNAs according to peak expression times identified waves of transcription, similar to those observed with mRNAs (Fig&#160;1B, right panel) and with miRNAs (Avraham et&#160;al, 2010). Unlike mRNA, the majority of lncRNAs exhibited downregulation in response to EGF stimulation. However, similar to mRNAs, many lncRNAs displayed very rapid responses; their down&#8208; or upregulation initiated as early as 20&#160;min after stimulation (confirmed by use of quantitative PCR; Fig&#160;EV1). These early events are of special interest as they might represent immediate responses to EGF signaling, rather than later, indirect effects of the signaling cascade. In conclusion, the abundance of a group of lncRNAs dynamically changes following short treatments of mammary cells with a growth factor.</text>

      <text>Next, we assessed clinical cohorts for expression of the EGF&#8208;regulated lncRNAs from MCF10A cells. Two datasets of breast cancer patients were analyzed: The METABRIC dataset (Curtis et&#160;al, 2012) and several breast cancer cohorts integrated into a single dataset, called &#8220;Kaplan&#8211;Meier (KM) plotter&#8221; (Gyorffy et&#160;al, 2010). Each dataset includes ~2,000 breast cancer patients, who were followed for &gt;&#160;20&#160;years from initial diagnosis. In addition to gene expression data, derived from either Illumina (Curtis et&#160;al, 2012) or Affymetrix (Gyorffy et&#160;al, 2010) hybridization arrays, each dataset&#160;also includes information on relapse&#8208;free and overall patient survival time. A Kaplan&#8211;Meier (KM) survival curve was generated for each of the EGF&#8208;responsive lncRNAs. This analysis identified eleven EGF&#8208;regulated lncRNAs, the expression of which was found to be significantly associated with patients' survival (adjusted P&#8208;value &lt;&#160;0.05), in at least one dataset (Fig&#160;EV2). Figure&#160;2A presents the kinetics of abundance alterations of two such early response lncRNAs, LIMT and LOC388796. Interestingly, while low expression of the EGF&#8208;downregulated lncRNA called LIMT predicted shorter overall and relapse&#8208;free patient survival (Fig&#160;2B), high expression of LOC388796, which is upregulated in response to EGF, predicted poor patient prognosis (Fig&#160;EV2).</text>

      <text>Although some lncRNAs encode short peptides, and they might occupy ribosomes, most lncRNAs possess significantly lower coding potentials as compared to protein&#8208;coding genes (Dinger et&#160;al, 2008; Guttman et&#160;al, 2013; Ruiz&#8208;Orera et&#160;al, 2014). In order to verify that the eleven EGF&#8208;regulated transcripts identified above were indeed noncoding, we examined their coding probability using the Coding&#8208;Potential Assessment Tool&#8212;CPAT (Wang et&#160;al, 2013). As reference, we used coding potentials of 4,000 protein&#8208;coding RNAs and 4,000 known lncRNAs. Interestingly, the coding probabilities of all eleven lncRNAs we identified were similar to those of known lncRNAs and significantly lower than those of coding RNAs (Fig&#160;2C). In addition, the evolutionary conservation of the 11 genes displayed wide variation, with LIMT being the most conserved (Fig&#160;2D). In summary, we identified several noncoding RNAs, some of which are evolutionarily conserved. All these lncRNAs undergo abundance alterations in response to short treatments of human mammary cells with EGF, which might predict disease aggressiveness and patient outcome.</text>

      <text>Knocking down the expression of specific lncRNAs might uncover their cellular functions. Hence, we transfected MCF10A cells with lncRNA&#8208;specific siRNAs (available for nine out of the 11 clinically relevant lncRNAs) and measured knockdown efficiency using qPCR (Fig&#160;EV3A). Because efficient knockdown was achieved for LINC01089/LIMT, LOC642852, LOC344595, and LOC282997, the cellular functions of these genes were addressed using apoptosis and viability assays (Fig&#160;EV3B). Transfection with polo&#8208;like kinase 1 (PLK1)&#8208;specific siRNAs was used as reference, since knockdown of PLK1 usually leads to extensive apoptosis. In terms of viability and apoptosis, the only effect we observed was a slight increase in the fraction of dying cells following knockdown of LOC282997 (aka PDCD4&#8208;AS1, Fig&#160;EV3B), implying that the examined lncRNAs are not involved in cell survival or apoptosis.</text>

      <text>Since MCF10A cells adopt migratory phenotypes in response to EGF&#8208;induced stimulation (Tarcic et&#160;al, 2012), we examined the effect of lncRNA knockdown on cellular motility. Firstly, we placed siRNA&#8208;transfected cells in the upper compartment of Transwell migration chambers and determined their migration to the lower compartment, 20&#160;h later, in the presence of EGF. In this assay, EGFR&#8208;specific siRNAs were used as reference, and indeed, we observed strong inhibition of cellular migration following EGFR knockdown (86%; Fig&#160;EV3C). Knockdown of only one lncRNA, LIMT, caused a similarly large, but opposite effect on migration (Figs&#160;3A and EV3C). Consistent with this observation, knockdown of LIMT also increased the capacity of cells to invade through a layer of extracellular matrix (Fig&#160;3B). To complement this loss&#8208;of&#8208;function approach, we created an MCF10A subline stably overexpressing LIMT (or eGFP as control; see Fig&#160;EV3D). As expected, ectopic expression of LIMT reduced migratory and invasive capacities (Fig&#160;3A and B). To further validate the effect of LIMT on migration, we designed two shRNAs directed against different parts of the gene and show results for sh716, because it could more effectively downregulate the respective transcript (Fig&#160;EV3E, see Materials and Methods). Consistent with the observations made with siRNAs and with overexpression of LIMT, MCF10A cells stably expressing shLIMT displayed remarkably increased migration and invasion relative to control cells (Fig&#160;3A and B).</text>

      <text>Taken together with the ability of EGF to decrease expression of LIMT (Fig&#160;2A), the migration and invasion results proposed the following scenario: EGF treatment downregulates LIMT, an inhibitor of cell migration and invasion, thereby enhancing motility of mammary cells. To test this model, we used a chemical inhibitor, U0126, which specifically blocks a major signaling pathway downstream of EGFR, the RAS&#8208;to&#8208;ERK pathway. We first confirmed blocking efficacy by assaying ERK phosphorylation (Fig&#160;3C), as well as by measuring mRNA levels of EGR1, a downstream target of the RAS&#8208;to&#8208;ERK pathway (Fig&#160;EV3F). Ultimately, we measured RNA levels of LIMT and found that inhibiting the ERK pathway, using the MEK inhibitor, negated the decrease in abundance of LIMT (Fig&#160;3D). This observation suggests that the RAS&#8208;to&#8208;ERK pathway mediates EGF&#8208;induced downregulation of LIMT, as well as the consequent enhancement of cellular motility.</text>

      <text>Since high abundance of LIMT is associated with longer survival of advanced state breast cancer patients (Fig&#160;2B and Appendix&#160;Fig S1), we tested the prediction that overexpression of LIMT would attenuate metastasis in&#160;vivo. For this, we established a derivative of the highly metastatic MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 triple negative breast cancer cell line, which stably expresses an ectopic LIMT (or eGFP). As a prelude to the metastasis assays, we validated that manipulating the abundance of LIMT in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 can imitate the migration effects we observed with MCF10A cells (Fig&#160;EV4). Next, we injected RFP&#8208;labeled MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells overexpressing LIMT (or eGFP) into the tail vein of female SCID mice. Eighteen days after injection, lungs were excised and the number of metastatic nodules was quantified. Consistent with the in&#160;vitro results, overexpression of LIMT reduced the number of detectable metastatic nodules (Fig&#160;4A), supporting a role for LIMT in inhibiting metastasis formation in&#160;vivo. To corroborate these tests, we employed a reciprocal approach utilizing MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells stably expressing the selected shRNA specific to LIMT. As predicted, cells stably expressing shLIMT (sh716) displayed relatively high migratory capacity in&#160;vitro (Fig&#160;EV4). Hence, both knocked&#8208;down cells and control cells were then subjected to the above&#8208;described in&#160;vivo metastasis assay. Analyses of fluorescence images of the lungs from the LIMT knockdown group confirmed the ability of LIMT to inhibit metastasis of mammary cells from the circulation to lungs (Fig&#160;4B). Overall, two independent lines of animal studies attributed to this EGF&#8208;downregulated lncRNA an important role in regulating metastasis formation; hence, we denoted it as LIMT (LncRNA Inhibiting Metastasis).</text>

      <text>To gain deeper understanding of LIMT, we explored its genomic characteristics. LIMT maps to chromosome 12, between the protein&#8208;coding genes SETD1B and RHOF. In accordance with earlier reports (Ulitsky et&#160;al, 2011), the human LIMT gene is highly conserved throughout most of its length, with its 5&#8242; portion (which encodes the first four exons) showing a very high degree of conservation in vertebrates (Fig&#160;5A, green rectangle). This observation hints that a cellular function of LIMT, such as recognition of other molecules, might localize to the transcript's 5&#8242; region. Because LIMT is dynamically expressed in mammary cells, we predicted the presence of histone modifications at the 5&#8242; region. Analyses of histone marks characteristic of transcriptionally active, open chromatin structures, such as H3K4Me3, in the vicinity of the transcription start site of LIMT, were consistent with an active promoter (Fig&#160;5A). To corroborate this observation, we investigated changes in tri&#8208;acetylation of histone 3 (lysine 27; H3K27Ac), a marker of transcriptional activity. This was done by immunoprecipitating H3K27Ac from MCF10A cells, after stimulation with EGF. Profiling immunoprecipitated DNA fragments using deep sequencing detected an overall decrease in acetylation of histone 3 at lysine 27, especially at the 5&#8242; region, as early as 20&#160;min post&#8208;stimulation (Fig&#160;5A, red rectangle). This observation is consistent with the observed EGF&#8208;induced reduction in transcript abundance (Fig&#160;2A). Interestingly, although some lncRNAs have been shown to affect the expression of neighboring genes in cis, the abundance of LIMT showed only weak correlation with transcript levels of the flanking genes, namely SETD1B and RHOF (Fig&#160;EV5A and B). This observation suggests that expression of LIMT is uncoupled from that of the neighboring, protein&#8208;coding genes.</text>

      <text>Because lncRNAs might act as scaffolds or decoys, which interact with microRNAs (Poliseno et&#160;al, 2010; Yuan et&#160;al, 2014) and the epigenetic machinery (Rinn, 2014) to regulate transcription, we explored potential downstream targets of LIMT. To this end, we firstly manipulated the levels of LIMT in MCF10A cells, by means of either siRNA&#8208;mediated knockdown or stable overexpression. We then profiled genomewide abundance of RNAs using Affymetrix microarrays. Analysis of the microarray screens identified 48 genes that undergo reciprocal expression changes in response to LIMT knockdown and overexpression (i.e. at least a 1.5&#8208;fold change in expression compared to control; Fig&#160;EV5C). Remarkably, the selected group of genes included several noncoding RNAs and coding genes, such as TGFB2, SERPINB2, PTPRZ1, RHOB and IL&#8208;24, which are known to be regulators of cellular migration. Future studies will test direct or indirect interactions between LIMT and the respective promoters, or their chromatin marks.</text>

      <text>The finding that LIMT is downregulated in response to EGFR signaling and the ability of LIMT to inhibit metastasis in animal models correspond to our observations associating reduced LIMT expression with poor prognosis of breast cancer patients (Fig&#160;2B). This corollary led us to explore LIMT's expression patterns. As a first step, we analyzed a panel of 44 cell lines representing cancer and non&#8208;cancer cells from 15 tissues of human origin, including six breast cell lines. LIMT was found to be widely and differentially expressed, with relatively high expression in brain, blood, and several lung and mammary cell lines (Fig&#160;5B).</text>

      <text>Next, we evaluated relations between LIMT and molecular subtypes of breast cancer, in two cohorts of patients: the Oslo2 cohort (Aure et&#160;al, 2014) and the larger, METABRIC dataset (Curtis et&#160;al, 2012). In line with the aforementioned lines of evidence, the lowest expression of LIMT in both cohorts corresponded to&#160;patients diagnosed with basal&#8208;like cancer (Fig&#160;6A and Appendix&#160;Fig S1), an aggressive tumor frequently associated with high EGFR expression and mutations in the downstream pathways (Hoadley et&#160;al, 2007; Foulkes et&#160;al, 2010). Similarly, low expression of LIMT was noted in the other aggressive subgroup, HER2 enriched. In line with reduced expression in relatively aggressive tumors, low LIMT expression correlated with higher tumor grade and stage, HER2 positivity and ER negativity (Fig&#160;6B&#8211;D and Appendix&#160;Fig S1). In conclusion and in line with the analyses of patient survival, we performed on additional cohorts, the loss of LIMT might coincide with the acquisition of aggressive features by breast cancers.</text>

      <text>In summary, by investigating a model system that simulates autocrine and stromal mechanisms controlling invasion of mammary tumor cells across tissue barriers, we identified several lncRNA molecules, the expression of which is altered in response to a growth factor and might predict disease course. Focusing on one of these, LIMT (LINC01089), we obtained evidence in support of an EGF&#8208;induced, ERK&#8208;mediated downregulation of this noncoding RNA molecule. Manipulating LIMT's transcript levels inhibited the ability of mammary cells to migrate in&#160;vitro, as well as altered their ability to form metastases in mice. In line with clinical relevance of the EGFR&#8211;ERK&#8211;LIMT regulatory module, reduced expression of LIMT marks mammary tumors of patients diagnosed with relatively aggressive and advanced forms of the disease. Below, we discuss potential mechanisms and clinical implications of LIMT and other growth factor&#8208;responsive lncRNAs.</text>

      <text>Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease; hence, many efforts are being made to identify new drivers and classify tumors into increasing numbers of subtypes (Perou et&#160;al, 2000; Dawson et&#160;al, 2013). Thus, whereas initial profiling focused on finding histological characteristics and signatures of protein&#8208;coding genes, more recent studies have found that the expression of microRNAs may also assist prognosis and classification (Dvinge et&#160;al, 2013). Importantly, the relatively high tissue specificity of lncRNAs promises a role for these noncoding RNAs as drivers and biomarkers of breast cancer (Wang et&#160;al, 2011a). For example, a recent survey of 658 infiltrating ductal tumors reported that the lncRNA HOTAIR was significantly overexpressed in the HER2&#8208;positive subgroup, while the lncRNA HOTAIRM1 was significantly overexpressed in the basal&#8208;like subgroup (Su et&#160;al, 2014).</text>

      <text>Herein, we introduce a novel approach based on the identification of inducible lncRNAs. Our focus on growth factor&#8208;responsive&#160;lncRNAs was based on the fundamental involvement of stroma and growth factors in multiple steps of tumor progression (Witsch et&#160;al, 2010), including progression of basal&#8208;like tumors (Foulkes et&#160;al, 2010). Hence, expression of the EGF&#8208;inducible lncRNAs we uncovered was examined in large cohorts of breast&#160;cancer patients, with the vision of identifying potential drivers and biomarkers of the basal&#8208;like and the HER2&#8208;enriched subtypes. The unbiased screen identified several EGF&#8208;responsive lncRNAs, which have previously been associated with cancer progression, demonstrating the suitability of our approach. For example, Neat1, which is overexpressed in advanced ovarian carcinoma and assists diagnosis (Pils et&#160;al, 2013), and LINC00472, high expression of which is correlated with reduced risk of relapse and death of breast cancer patients (Shen et&#160;al, 2015). Importantly, both lncRNAs were found to be early responders to EGF in our cellular model.</text>

      <text>Notably, the analysis we performed also identified new candidate lncRNAs, with potential roles in breast cancer progression and profiling. Functional assays of the candidates, which made use of RNA interference, led us to focus on a previously uncharacterized lncRNA, referred herein as LIMT (originally denoted as LINC01089 or LOC338799). We found that downregulation of this lncRNA depends on prior activation of EGFR and the RAS&#8208;to&#8208;ERK pathway. Notably, this signaling route is frequently activated in hormone&#8208;independent breast cancer and serves as a driver of mammary cell migration (Tarcic et&#160;al, 2012). Accordingly, we found that knockdown of LIMT enhanced cellular migration and invasion in&#160;vitro, as well as metastasis in&#160;vivo. Because lncRNAs such as ANRIL, SRG1 and Paupar might regulate in cis the expression of nearby genes (Martens et&#160;al, 2004; Kotake et&#160;al, 2011), we investigated whether LIMT's neighbors, namely the protein&#8208;coding genes RHOF (positioned 1,579&#8208;bp downstream of LIMT) and SETD1B (located on the opposite strand to LIMT, at a distance of 1,248&#160;bp), are co&#8208;expressed in tumors. However, expression of these genes did not correlate to that of LIMT.</text>

      <text>Understanding the mechanisms by which LIMT regulates cellular migration and tumor progression is a matter of further investigation. Because LIMT, and especially its 5&#8242; region, is one of only 29&#160;lincRNAs that display very high sequence conservation throughout all vertebrates (Ulitsky et&#160;al, 2011), we assume that LIMT's function is shared by several species and that it requires a specific structure at the 5&#8242; region. Presumably, physical interactions of LIMT with protein or RNA molecules regulate transcription of coding and noncoding genes involved in cellular motility. Some of these genes may appear in the groups we identified by applying array technology on LIMT&#8208;manipulated mammary cells. Alternatively, like several other lncRNAs, LIMT might interact with the epigenetic machinery (Rinn, 2014). Current studies also uncover binding of lncRNAs with microRNAs (Poliseno et&#160;al, 2010; Yuan et&#160;al, 2014), and yet other studies unearth roles of peptides encoded by short open&#8208;reading frames present within putative lncRNAs (Bazzini et&#160;al, 2014; Ruiz&#8208;Orera et&#160;al, 2014). Regardless of the underlying mechanism, reduced expression of LIMT emerges from the present study as a trait of relatively aggressive, basal&#8208;like and HER2&#8208;driven breast tumors. In the same vein, we found that LIMT is downregulated in grade 3 and in stage 4 mammary tumors compared to less advanced tumors. Thus, LIMT might represent a new class of EGF&#8208;controlled and ERK&#8208;mediated inhibitors of breast cancer metastasis, which function as tumor&#8208;suppressor lncRNAs.</text>

The raw data were normalized and filtered in order to make the experiments comparable with each other and in order to reduce noise. Furthermore, probes having low&#8208;quality measurements were filtered out. Next, for each probe, the log2 ratio of expression between each time point and time &#8220;zero&#8221; was calculated. Genes were considered changing if a fold change of &gt;&#160;0.6 log2 was observed in at least one time point. Additionally, since many of the lncRNA probes were based on putative lncRNA annotations, we overlapped the position of each probe with RefSeq annotated ncRNAs. Only probes overlapping annotated RefSeq ncRNAs were retained for assessment of the effect of EGF stimulation on transcript abundance. The microarray dataset is accessible at the ArrayExpress database (E&#8208;MTAB&#8208;4822). In addition, we used DNA arrays to profile gene expression upon manipulation of LIMT levels. Twelve RNA samples, representing (i) knockdown of LIMT, (ii) knockdown using control siRNA (iii) overexpression of LIMT, and (iv) overexpression of eGFP (all in biological triplicates), were analyzed using GeneChip&#174; Human Gene 2.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix). The raw data were normalized and used to identify genes differentially affected by knockdown versus overexpression of LIMT in MCF10A cells.

      <text>Three datasets were used. (i) METABRIC (Curtis et&#160;al, 2012), which contains gene expression profiles of &#8764;2,000 breast cancer patients. Profiling was done using Illumina's gene expression microarrays and survival of patients was followed for up to 25&#160;years from diagnosis; (ii) a dataset (Gyorffy et&#160;al, 2010) that analyzed patient survival (www.kmplot.com) based on gene expression and clinical data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The version of the online tool we used analyzed 1,660 breast cancer patients; and (iii) Oslo2, a consecutive study that collects specimens from breast cancer patients referred to primary surgical treatment in the Oslo (Norway) region (Aure et&#160;al, 2014). For Oslo2, expression was measured using SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60K one&#8208;color microarrays (Agilent Technologies), according to the manufacturer's protocol. For each sample, RNA (100&#160;ng) was amplified and hybridized to an array, which included 42,405 unique 60&#8208;mer probes, targeting 27,958 Entrez genes and 7,419 lncRNAs. Scanning was performed with an Agilent Scanner G2565A. Signals were extracted using Feature Extraction v.10.7.3.1 (Agilent Technologies). Arrays were log2&#8208;transformed, normalized, and hospital&#8208;adjusted by subtracting from each probe value the median probe value among samples from the same hospital. Probes with identical Entrez ID were averaged to form a single expression value per gene. Molecular subtypes of disease were derived using the PAM50 classifier (Parker et&#160;al, 2009). Subtypes were available for 381 tumors. To evaluate differences in lncRNA expression between two groups, a Student's t&#8208;test was applied, and to evaluate differences in expression among three or more groups, a one&#8208;way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied. Data from 309 tumors were available for comparison of lncRNA expression between different clinical subgroups.</text>

      <text>Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease, the classification and understanding of which is still incomplete. Further in&#8208;depth analysis of both protein&#8208;coding and noncoding genes is vital to accelerate the resolution of these issues.</text>

      <text>Because growth factors play essential roles in both mammary gland development and in breast cancer progression, and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as cardinal regulators of gene expression, we profiled epidermal growth factor (EGF) inducible expression of lncRNAs in normal mammary cells. A subset of the EGF&#8208;inducible lncRNAs we identified correlated with clinical outcome of breast cancer patients. One of these, a highly conserved lncRNAs we called LIMT, is downregulated by EGF due to histone deacetylation at the respective promoter. In agreement with this, LIMT is expressed at low levels in the basal&#8208;like and in the HER2&#8208;enriched, two relatively aggressive subtypes of breast cancer. Furthermore, LIMT was found to inhibit the migration of mammary cells and to reduce metastasis formation in&#160;vivo.</text>

      <text>In general, our results confirm and extend the roles of lncRNAs in progression of breast cancer. Specifically, we identify LIMT as a marker and putative driver of two relatively aggressive subtypes of breast cancer.</text>
