      <text>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive symptoms of learning and memory deficits. Such cognitive impairments are attributed to brain atrophy resulting from progressive neuronal and synaptic loss; therefore, alleviation of neural cell death is as an important target of treatment as other classical hallmarks of AD, such as aggregation of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) and hyperphosphorylation of tau. Here, we found that an anti&#8208;necroptotic molecule necrostatin&#8208;1 (Nec&#8208;1) directly targets A&#946; and tau proteins, alleviates brain cell death and ameliorates cognitive impairment in AD models. In the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 double&#8208;transgenic mice, Nec&#8208;1 treatment reduced the levels of A&#946; oligomers, plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau without affecting production of A&#946;, while it altered the levels of apoptotic marker proteins. Our results showing multiple beneficial modes of action of Nec&#8208;1 against AD provide evidence that Nec&#8208;1 may serve an important role in the development of preventive approach for AD.</text>

      <text>Neural and synaptic loss, indicated by gradual cerebral atrophy, is a prominent feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Terry et&#160;al, 1991; Jack et&#160;al, 2000, 2004). Neural cell death especially in the cortex and hippocampus is responsible for the decline of learning and memory abilities observed in AD patients (Double et&#160;al, 1996; Niikura et&#160;al, 2006). These brain lesions are accompanied by the accumulation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which mainly consist of aggregated amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) and hyperphosphorylated tau, respectively (Schoonenboom et&#160;al, 2004; Sobow et&#160;al, 2004).</text>

      <text>In developing drugs for AD, different approaches have been taken in many extensive investigations; however, most drugs currently available serve to modulate the degree of symptoms without affecting the fundamental causes (Yiannopoulou &amp; Papageorgiou, 2013; Kim et&#160;al, 2015). Thus, drug candidates targeting the prevention of neural loss as well as the alleviation of A&#946; aggregation and tau hyperphosphorylation would be promising therapeutic approach to treat AD (Hong&#8208;Qi et&#160;al, 2012; Mondragon&#8208;Rodriguez et&#160;al, 2012).</text>

      <text>As neurodegeneration is highly associated with AD progression (Serrano&#8208;Pozo et&#160;al, 2011), it is essential to investigate a means to regulate cell death in the brain in order to find therapeutic interventions for AD. The small molecule necrostatin&#8208;1 (Nec&#8208;1) is a well&#8208;established inhibitor of necroptotic cell death, also known as necroptosis (Degterev et&#160;al, 2005). In particular, Nec&#8208;1 is reported to have neuroprotective effects in several brain disease models by reducing tissue damage in brain injury, alleviating functional deficits in Huntington's disease and inhibiting neural cell degeneration induced by aluminium (Zhu et&#160;al, 2011; Wang et&#160;al, 2012; Qinli et&#160;al, 2013; Su et&#160;al, 2015). Many studies have indicated that necroptosis inhibition by Nec&#8208;1 can be attributed to its regulation of a signalling complex containing members of the receptor interacting protein kinase (RIPK) family, RIPK1 and RIPK3 (Degterev et&#160;al, 2008; Vandenabeele et&#160;al, 2013). Recently, the RIPK1/RIPK3 signalling complex has been reported to exhibit amyloidal properties required for necroptosis (Li et&#160;al, 2012).</text>

      <text>Taking all of these findings from previous studies into consideration, we hypothesized that Nec&#8208;1 could modulate neural cell death and that its effects could possibly extend to treating amyloidal properties of A&#946; and tau in the AD brain. We aimed to search for prophylactic treatment targeting multiple neuropathological changes before outward symptoms of AD become apparent because aggregation of A&#946; and hyperphosphorylation of tau begin in the pre&#8208;symptomatic stage that intervening AD as early as possible is deemed more effective and practical (Jack et&#160;al, 2010, 2013). In this study, we investigated the effects of Nec&#8208;1 on A&#946;&#8208;induced neural cell death in&#160;vitro using multiple cell models. Furthermore, APP/PS1 double&#8208;transgenic mice were subjected to behavioural tests to evaluate whether Nec&#8208;1 alters cortical&#8208; and hippocampal&#8208;dependent cognitive functions, and the brains were examined for changes in the levels of A&#946; plaques, oligomers, hyperphosphorylated tau and apoptotic marker proteins. Additionally, bimolecular interactions of Nec&#8208;1 with A&#946; or tau were studied to further understand the effects of Nec&#8208;1 in relation to AD aetiology.</text>

      <text>The transition of A&#946; monomers into neurotoxic aggregates serves as a pathological trigger in AD, ultimately resulting in cerebral atrophy (Irvine et&#160;al, 2008). To investigate the effect of Nec&#8208;1 on A&#946;&#8208;induced brain cell death, we first examined the cytotoxicity of Nec&#8208;1 in neural cells. In HT22 cells (hippocampal neuronal cell line) treated with different concentrations of Nec&#8208;1, we did not observe decreases in cell viability while A&#946;(1&#8211;42) aggregates induced neural cell death (Fig&#160;1B). Then, we conducted cell viability assays using BV2 (microglial cell line) and primary cultured astrocytes derived from the cortex and hippocampus of C57BL/6 mouse brains in addition to HT22 cells. Nec&#8208;1 (50&#160;&#956;M) was applied to each cell model (pre&#8208;treatment) 15&#160;min before A&#946;(1&#8211;42) aggregates (10&#160;&#956;M) were added to cells. We prepared A&#946;(1&#8211;42) aggregates by incubating A&#946;(1&#8211;42) monomers (1&#160;mM) at 37&#176;C overnight, then diluting the peptide stock with cell culture medium. Cells cultured in the absence of Nec&#8208;1 and A&#946;(1&#8211;42) aggregates were used as controls (non&#8208;treated), and the level of cell viability was quantified by MTT assays. Cell proliferation significantly decreased in all cultured cells treated with A&#946;(1&#8211;42) aggregates compared to non&#8208;treated cells (Fig&#160;1C). However, for all three types of cells with Nec&#8208;1 pre&#8208;treatment, the cell viabilities did not significantly decrease in the presence of A&#946;(1&#8211;42) aggregates, indicating that Nec&#8208;1 can effectively block the cytotoxicity of A&#946;(1&#8211;42) (Fig&#160;1C). To further confirm the anti&#8208;cytotoxic effect of Nec&#8208;1, we used the LIVE/DEAD&#174; Viability/Cytotoxicity Assay. In this assay, live cells are distinguished from dead cells by two different fluorescent molecules: calcein AM indicating live cells (green colour) and ethidium homodimer&#8208;1 (EthD&#8208;1) indicating dead cells (red colour) (Xie et&#160;al, 2009). Although non&#8208;treated cells showed some endogenous cell death, this was severely increased after the addition of A&#946;(1&#8211;42) aggregates. However, the levels of cell death were not significantly different between Nec&#8208;1 pre&#8208;treated cells and non&#8208;treated cells (Fig&#160;1D and E). These results indicated that Nec&#8208;1 can block A&#946;(1&#8211;42)&#8208;induced neural cell death in&#160;vitro.</text>

      <text>Extracellular A&#946; is known to be internalized into neural cells, and such internalization is associated with cell death in the brain (Friedrich et&#160;al, 2010; Kim et&#160;al, 2013b). To determine whether Nec&#8208;1 affects A&#946; penetration into neural cells, A&#946;(1&#8211;42) levels in the cytoplasmic fractions of neuronal and microglial cells were analysed by Western blot. HT22 and BV2 cell lines were pre&#8208;treated with Nec&#8208;1 15&#160;min prior to the addition of A&#946;(1&#8211;42) (10&#160;&#956;M). We observed that Nec&#8208;1 treatment did not affect the level of A&#946;(1&#8211;42) monomers in the cytoplasm of either HT22 or BV2 cell lines (Fig&#160;1F). This result indicated that A&#946;(1&#8211;42) penetration into the cell is not affected by Nec&#8208;1.</text>

      <text>To explore the cell death signalling pathway by which Nec&#8208;1 blocks A&#946;&#8208;induced neural cell death, expression levels of apoptotic molecules were measured in HT22, BV2 and primary cultured astrocyte lysates by Western blot. The molecules investigated were poly (ADP&#8208;ribose) polymerase&#8208;1 (PARP1), which is specifically proteolysed by caspases in response to genotoxic stress, such as DNA damage, to induce apoptotic cell death (D'Amours et&#160;al, 2001); cleaved caspase&#8208;3, which plays a central role in the apoptotic signalling pathway (Salvesen, 2002); cytochrome&#8208;c, a small molecule released from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm during apoptosis (Liu et&#160;al, 1996); Bax, a pro&#8208;apoptotic member of the Bcl&#8208;2 protein family (Oltvai et&#160;al, 1993; Lalier et&#160;al, 2007); Bcl&#8208;2, an anti&#8208;apoptotic protein that inhibits activation of the apoptotic cell death pathway (Belka &amp; Budach, 2002); and phosphorylated c&#8208;Jun N&#8208;terminal kinase (JNK), which activates apoptotic signalling by upregulating pro&#8208;apoptotic genes (Dhanasekaran &amp; Reddy, 2008). Each cell model was pre&#8208;treated with Nec&#8208;1 before cell death was induced by A&#946;(1&#8211;42) aggregates (10&#160;&#956;M). In BV2 cell lysates, Nec&#8208;1 pre&#8208;treatment led to marked inhibition in the A&#946;(1&#8211;42)&#8208;induced processing rates of PARP1, caspase&#8208;3 and Bax. In addition, Bcl&#8208;2 expression was increased, whereas no significant difference was observed in cytochrome&#8208;c expression (Fig&#160;1G). In primary astrocytes, marker protein expression levels followed a similar trend to that observed in BV2 cells. The pro&#8208;apoptotic markers cytochrome&#8208;c and Bax were highly expressed in the presence of A&#946;(1&#8211;42) aggregates, but their levels decreased with Nec&#8208;1 pre&#8208;treatment. The expression of anti&#8208;apoptotic Bcl&#8208;2, which was hardly observed in the presence of A&#946;(1&#8211;42) aggregates, dramatically increased with Nec&#8208;1 pre&#8208;treatment. Furthermore, the level of phosphorylated JNK was reduced in primary astrocytes pre&#8208;treated with Nec&#8208;1, indicating decreased apoptotic cell death (Fig&#160;1G). However, HT22 cells exhibited no significant A&#946;&#8208;induced differences in apoptotic marker protein levels, except for cytochrome&#8208;c expression, which was slightly decreased by Nec&#8208;1 pre&#8208;treatment (Fig&#160;1G). Taken together, these findings suggested a role of Nec&#8208;1 in blocking neural cell death via an apoptotic pathway induced by A&#946;.</text>

      <text>The inhibitory effects of Nec&#8208;1 on A&#946;&#8208;induced cytotoxicity suggest a potential application of the molecule to treat A&#946;&#8208;related learning and memory deficits. To assess the prophylactic effect of Nec&#8208;1 on spatial working and hippocampal memory, we utilized the APPswe/PS1&#8208;dE9 double&#8208;transgenic mouse model (APP/PS1) (Jankowsky et&#160;al, 2004). This mouse model expresses mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin protein 1 (PS1), causing AD&#8208;like amyloid plaque formation as early as &#160;months of age while cognitive impairment becomes observable around 6&#8211;8&#160;months of age (Savonenko et&#160;al, 2005; Jackson et&#160;al, 2013). To 4&#8208;month&#8208;old male APP/PS1 mice, we intravenously injected Nec&#8208;1 (n&#160;=&#160;7) or vehicle (n&#160;=&#160;6) for 12 weeks until the age of 7 months (Fig&#160;2A). As controls, we intravenously injected age&#8208;matched male wild&#8208;type (Wt) mice with Nec&#8208;1 (n&#160;=&#160;7) or vehicle (n&#160;=&#160;7) for 12&#160;weeks. We subjected these mice to Y&#8208;maze and passive avoidance tests 2&#160;days after the last administration of Nec&#8208;1 to assess alterations in learning and memory abilities.</text>

      <text>In the three&#8208;armed Y&#8208;shaped maze, a mouse is free to visit the three arms in any order, and the number of entries to the three different arms in a row is measured and compared to the number of total visits. The resulting per cent alternation can be used as a measure for spatial working memory, as a mouse with higher visual cortex function demonstrates higher per cent alternation (Gotz &amp; Ittner, 2008). In this study, we found that Nec&#8208;1 administration significantly improved behavioural performance of the APP/PS1 mice compared to that of the vehicle&#8208;administered APP/PS1 group (P&#160;=&#160;0.01465), as suggested by increased per cent alternation. The spatial working memory of APP/PS1 mice was recovered up to Wt levels after Nec&#8208;1 administration (Fig&#160;2B). In addition, we did not observe behavioural differences between Nec&#8208;1 and vehicle&#8208;administered Wt groups. No significant difference in total number of arm entries was found, excluding hyperactivity as a possible confounding factor for cognitive improvement (Fig&#160;2C).</text>

      <text>To evaluate the effect of Nec&#8208;1 on hippocampal&#8208;dependent memory in APP/PS1 mice, we performed the passive avoidance test. Mice were rested for 3 days after completion of the Y&#8208;maze test, and no additional injections were provided (Fig&#160;2A). In this test, the latency of movement from a bright to a dark chamber is measured and compared before and after an electrical shock application. A difference in latency following an aversive experience (retention) reflects contextual memory recollection, and shorter latencies indicate impairment in hippocampal memory function (Lorenzini et&#160;al, 1996). We did not find any significant difference in latencies between Wt and APP/PS1 mice, regardless of Nec&#8208;1 administration, before shock application (acquisition). In the retention trial, however, APP/PS1 mice showed significantly shorter latency compared to Wt mice (P&#160;=&#160;0.00362) when both groups were administered with vehicle, whereas APP/PS1 mice administered with Nec&#8208;1 showed greatly enhanced latency compared to APP/PS1 mice&#160;administered with vehicle (P&#160;=&#160;0.0429) (Fig&#160;2D). All mice we examined survived throughout the aforementioned behavioural studies, indicating that Nec&#8208;1 administration does not have lethal effect in both Wt and APP/PS1 mice (Fig&#160;2E). These results suggest that Nec&#8208;1 administration in APP/PS1 mice prevented cognitive impairment related to the A&#946; cascade.</text>

      <text>To confirm whether Nec&#8208;1 administration could also affect AD&#8208;like cognitive impairment of a different mouse model, we acutely induced memory deficits in Imprinting Control Region (ICR) mice (8&#8208;week&#8208;old male, n&#160;=&#160;8 per group) by intracerebroventricular injection of A&#946;(1&#8211;42) aggregates (Fig&#160;2F and G). The benefit of this A&#946;(1&#8211;42) infusion model is that we can control the onset of abnormal A&#946; deposition as well as timely treatment of Nec&#8208;1 (Kim et&#160;al, 2016). To examine the prophylactic effect of Nec&#8208;1 in the A&#946;(1&#8211;42) infusion model, Nec&#8208;1 was intravenously injected every 3 days for a week, followed by an intracerebroventricular injection of A&#946;(1&#8211;42) aggregates and additional two injections of Nec&#8208;1 for another week. We conducted Y&#8208;maze tests 2&#160;days after the last injection of Nec&#8208;1 to assess alterations of short&#8208;term spatial working memory (Fig&#160;2F). In the Y&#8208;maze test, Nec&#8208;1 injections significantly ameliorated A&#946;(1&#8211;42)&#8208;induced memory deficits (P&#160;=&#160;0.0002) (Fig&#160;2H and I). These results imply that Nec&#8208;1 prevented A&#946;&#8208;induced cognitive impairments in the A&#946;(1&#8211;42) infusion model as well.</text>

      <text>A&#946; aggregates into insoluble clusters, or plaques, in the AD brain as the disease progresses (Naslund et&#160;al, 1994; Shinkai et&#160;al, 1997). Formation of such plaques in the cortical and hippocampal regions is directly related to learning and memory deficits in AD (Jahn, 2013). Given that Nec&#8208;1 targets the heterodimeric filamentous complex of RIPK1/RIPK3 (Cho et&#160;al, 2011), which is similar to the characteristic of A&#946; misfolding (Li et&#160;al, 2012), we hypothesized that Nec&#8208;1 might directly bind to A&#946; aggregates. First, we explored the interaction between A&#946;(1&#8211;42) and RIPK3, a signalling molecule involved in Nec&#8208;1&#8208;regulated cell death (Degterev et&#160;al, 2008; Vandenabeele et&#160;al, 2013). HT22, BV2 and primary astrocytes were treated with A&#946;(1&#8211;42) (10&#160;&#956;M). At 12 and 24&#160;h following A&#946; treatment, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti&#8208;RIPK3 antibody and subjected to Western blot analyses to measure A&#946;(1&#8211;42) levels. Using a monoclonal anti&#8208;A&#946; antibody (6E10), we observed the presence of A&#946;(1&#8211;42) bound to RIPK3, suggesting a similarity in amyloidal properties between RIPK3 and A&#946;(1&#8211;42) (Fig&#160;3A). This result raised the possibility that Nec&#8208;1 may directly bind to A&#946; aggregates. According to a previous report on the crystal structure of RIPK1 in complex with Nec&#8208;1 analog, Nec&#8208;1a, it was caged in a hydrophobic pocket between the N&#8208; and C&#8208;lobes of the kinase domain, having mostly van der Waals interactions with hydrophobic residues (L70, V75, V76, L78, L90, L129, V134, L157, L159, F162) and a few hydrogen bondings (D156, S161) (Xie et&#160;al, 2013). As we observed that Nec&#8208;1 also binds to the same hydrophobic pockets of RIPK1 (Fig&#160;3B), we searched by modelling for a similar sized&#8208;hydrophobic site, where Nec&#8208;1 could bind in A&#946; aggregates. When the available structure of 12&#8208;mer A&#946; fibrils was examined as surface treatment (Fig&#160;3C), we observed several plausible hydrophobic pockets, within size of 9&#8211;14.5&#160;&#197;, and Nec&#8208;1 consequently docked in those pockets. Without induced fit, we could simulate four molecules of Nec&#8208;1 docked on the A&#946; fibrils with substantial docking scores (&#8722;8.338, &#8722;4.755, &#8722;8.493 and &#8722;6.754 in clockwise order starting from the top&#8208;left corner) and ligand efficiency (Fig&#160;3D). To confirm a possible interaction between Nec&#8208;1 and A&#946; aggregates, we applied a label&#8208;free surface plasmon resonance assay to estimate bimolecular binding kinetics using the Biacore T200 system. After immobilization of A&#946;(1&#8211;42) aggregates on CM5 dextran matrix sensor chips via amine coupling, Nec&#8208;1 was injected into the microfluidic channel as an analyte. Kinetic analysis was performed at a concentration range of 0.038&#8211;39.06&#160;nM. Although the precise binding constant could not be calculated due to the heterogeneous nature of A&#946; aggregates and it is uncommon to measure bimolecular interactions between a small molecule and heterogeneous misfolded proteins, the direct and dose&#8208;dependent interaction of Nec&#8208;1 with immobilized A&#946; aggregates was indicated by the substantial curve fitting efficiency (6.18&#160;RU2 of calculated &#967;2) (Fig&#160;3E).</text>

      <text>To examine the effect of Nec&#8208;1 on plaque formation in the brain, we observed the levels of A&#946; plaques in mice subjected to the aforementioned behavioural studies. Mice were anesthetized with 2% avertin (20&#160;&#956;g/g, i.p.) and perfused with 0.9% NaCl. Extracted brains were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and immersed in 30% sucrose for cryoprotection. Fixed brain samples were sectioned at 30&#160;&#956;m and stained with thioflavin S (ThS) to visualize insoluble &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich A&#946; plaques. Total numbers and areas of plaques found in the whole brain, cortex or hippocampus were quantified. In the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, we observed numerous plaques at 7&#160;months of age, but plaque formation was dramatically inhibited in Nec&#8208;1&#8208;administered APP/PS1 mice (Fig&#160;4A). Total numbers and areas of plaques in whole brains of Nec&#8208;1&#8208;administered APP/PS1 mice were notably decreased compared to those with the vehicle administration (Fig&#160;4B and C). This trend was consistent in both the cortical (Fig&#160;4D and E) and hippocampal (Fig&#160;4F and G) regions, implying that Nec&#8208;1 administration affects plaque formation in different brain regions.</text>

      <text>A&#946; plaques can be classified into dense&#8208;core and diffuse plaques. Dense&#8208;core plaques differ from diffuse plaques in that only dense&#8208;core plaques can be stained with ThS due to their aggregated &#946;&#8208;sheet structure, which is not present in diffuse plaques (Rak et&#160;al, 2007). Diffuse A&#946; plaques in AD have been suggested to be associated with reactive astrocytes that cluster around them and result in neurodegenerative events (Funato et&#160;al, 1998; Yamaguchi et&#160;al, 1998). Therefore, we performed immunohistochemical staining in the brains of mice that underwent behavioural studies to detect diffuse plaques and reactive astrocytes, using the 6E10 antibody and anti&#8208;glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody, respectively. We found that diffuse plaques co&#8208;localized with reactive astrocytes in APP/PS1 mouse brains, and that Nec&#8208;1 administration induced decreases in the levels of diffuse plaques as well as GFAP in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice (Fig&#160;5A).</text>

      <text>In the AD brain, A&#946; oligomers are a major cause of neural and synaptic loss due to their high toxicity (Sakono &amp; Zako, 2010; Benilova et&#160;al, 2012). To investigate whether Nec&#8208;1 can prevent the formation of A&#946; oligomers, we performed dot blot analyses using 6E10 and anti&#8208;amyloidogenic protein oligomer (A11) antibodies in cortex and hippocampus lysates from the mice in the aforementioned tests. 6E10 detects all A&#946; species and also recognizes APP, whereas A11 only detects oligomeric proteins. We found that Nec&#8208;1 decreased the levels of oligomeric species, but the concentration of total soluble A&#946;, which included monomers, was not significantly altered (Fig&#160;5B&#8211;D). Furthermore, we measured soluble and insoluble A&#946;(1&#8211;42), which were separated from cortex and hippocampus of the mice in the aforementioned tests by RIPA (soluble fraction) and guanidine (insoluble fraction) lysis buffers, by enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As a result, we found that both soluble and insoluble A&#946;(1&#8211;42) levels were decreased in the brains of APP/PS1 mice injected with Nec&#8208;1 (Fig&#160;5E). Western blot analysis showed that Nec&#8208;1 did not affect the levels of APP and sAPP&#945; in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, suggesting that Nec&#8208;1 does not affect A&#946; production (Fig&#160;5F).</text>

      <text>Next, we examined whether Nec&#8208;1 has a direct effect on A&#946; oligomerization by the thioflavin&#8208;T (ThT) assay. ThT is known to detect beta&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich protein aggregates (Wolfe et&#160;al, 2010). We incubated monomeric A&#946;(1&#8211;42) for 5&#160;days to allow for the aggregation. When A&#946;(1&#8211;42) was incubated in the presence of Nec&#8208;1, we observed that A&#946;(1&#8211;42) aggregation was dramatically decreased, suggesting that Nec&#8208;1 has an inhibitory effect on A&#946; aggregation (Fig&#160;5G). To further visualize the effect of Nec&#8208;1 against A&#946; aggregation, we performed SDS&#8211;PAGE with photo&#8208;induced cross&#8208;linking of the unmodified proteins (PICUP) followed by silver staining to monitor A&#946; oligomerization and fibrillization (Bitan, 2006). We found that Nec&#8208;1 strikingly reduced both A&#946; oligomers and fibrils (Fig&#160;5H). Taken together, Nec&#8208;1 directly binds to A&#946; aggregates and prevents the formation of A&#946; plaques and oligomers in the brains of APP/PS1 mice.</text>

      <text>As hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau proteins are highly associated with brain cell death in AD, changes in tau abnormalities are important indications of AD progression (Calissano et&#160;al, 2009; Amadoro et&#160;al, 2011). To assess the effects of Nec&#8208;1 on tauopathy in AD, we measured alterations in the levels of total and phosphorylated tau with apoptotic markers in the brains of mice previously studied in behavioural tests. We used a monoclonal antibody against phosphorylated&#8208;S199 (Catalog ab81268, Abcam), which is an important post&#8208;translation modification site of tauopathy and shared by both human and murine tau proteins. Nec&#8208;1 reduced the levels of phosphorylated tau, phospho&#8208;S199, in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice (Fig&#160;6A). Consistent with our cell&#8208;based studies, the cortex of APP/PS1 mice after Nec&#8208;1 injections showed increased expression of the anti&#8208;apoptotic protein Bcl&#8208;2 as well as slightly decreased expression of pro&#8208;apoptotic proteins, including cytochrome&#8208;c and cleaved caspase&#8208;3, compared to the vehicle&#8208;administered group (Fig&#160;6A). To further confirm the effect of Nec&#8208;1 on inhibition of tau phosphorylation, we conducted immunohistochemical analysis of phosphorylated S199 of tau in brains of aforementioned APP/PS1 mice. Nec&#8208;1 administration dramatically reduced levels of phosphorylated tau, specifically the phospho&#8208;S199 site, in both cortical and hippocampal regions of APP/PS1 mice (Fig&#160;6B).</text>

      <text>Next, we assessed the inhibitory effect of Nec&#8208;1 on necroptotic signalling in the brain of APP/PS1 mice. Given that Nec&#8208;1 regulates a signalling complex containing members of RIPK family (Degterev&#160;et&#160;al, 2008; Vandenabeele et&#160;al, 2013), we measured phosphorylation levels of RIPK3 by Western blot analysis. In APP/PS1 mice, Nec&#8208;1 reduced the phosphorylation level of RIPK3 in both cortex and hippocampus. Further analysis of primary cultured astrocytes showed the consistent result of reduced phosphorylation level of RIPK3 by Nec&#8208;1 (Fig&#160;6C).</text>

      <text>We examined whether Nec&#8208;1 has a direct effect on tau aggregation by the thioflavin&#8208;T (ThT) assay. In this study, we used the recombinant K18 fragment of full&#8208;length human tau, as it is an important binding domain involved in tau aggregation (Haque et&#160;al, 2014). First, we incubated a mixture of the K18 fragment and heparin in the presence of Nec&#8208;1 for 5&#160;days. We found that Nec&#8208;1 dramatically inhibited aggregation, suggesting that Nec&#8208;1 has an inhibitory effect on tau aggregation (Fig&#160;6D). Moreover, ThT fluorescence intensity was greatly reduced when Nec&#8208;1 was added to preformed K18 aggregates, implying that Nec&#8208;1 can also reduce tau complexes (Fig&#160;6E). To understand how Nec&#8208;1 interacts with tau, we investigated the bimolecular binding kinetics between Nec&#8208;1 and tau by label&#8208;free surface plasmon resonance assay using the Biacore T200 system. We immobilized K18 on CM5 dextran matrix sensor chips via an amine coupling. Nec&#8208;1 was injected into microfluidic channel as an analyte at a concentration ranging from 9.8 to 2,500&#160;nM. Although it is unusual to assess bimolecular interactions between a small molecule and misfolded tau proteins, the resulting, but precise, binding constant (K D&#160;=&#160;73.7&#160;nM) indicated substantial direct interaction between Nec&#8208;1 and the K18 fragment (Fig&#160;6F). Collectively, these findings suggested that Nec&#8208;1 blocks tau phosphorylation on Serine&#8208;199 and inhibits aggregate formation via direct interaction.</text>

      <text>Alzheimer's disease is characterized by four distinctive hallmarks, including A&#946; plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, neural and synaptic loss, and cognitive impairments (Serrano&#8208;Pozo et&#160;al, 2011). With no overt symptoms of cognitive impairments until substantial levels of A&#946; aggregation and tau hyperphosphorylation are accumulated in pre&#8208;symptomatic stage, however, AD is mostly diagnosed in later stages when irreversible degree of neural cell death and brain atrophy make full recovery from AD impractical (Jack et&#160;al, 2010, 2013). In addition, there are currently no fundamental therapies in symptomatic stage to effectively forestall the progression of AD (Selkoe, 2012). Thus, investigation of prophylactic approach to treat AD has been emphasized in many other studies, such as those of Anti&#8208;Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's (A4) and Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN), to prevent or delay the onset and progression of AD (Deweerdt, 2011; Garber, 2012; Selkoe, 2012).</text>

      <text>In this study, we propose that Nec&#8208;1 regulates multiple pathological culprits that are important in AD and suggest drug repositioning to regulate all aspects of AD in a comprehensive manner, from underlying neuropathological changes to outward symptomatic outcomes. However, the detailed signalling mechanism by which Nec&#8208;1 regulates aforementioned hallmarks along with neural cell death remains to be determined. Many drugs have been developed to enhance AD cognitive deficits, such as memantine, which acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist to block glutamate&#8208;mediated neurotoxicity (Danysz &amp; Parsons, 2003). Given that memantine administration hardly halts AD progression, it is still debatable if the anti&#8208;cell death approach will be fundamentally effective in clinical treatments. Although not specifically examined in the AD animal model, previous study reporting that decreases in expression levels of murine A&#946; and tau proteins by Nec&#8208;1 administration in aluminium&#8208;induced mouse model supports our view that Nec&#8208;1 has multiple mechanisms on AD pathology (Qinli et&#160;al, 2013). Further in&#8208;depth study on structure&#8211;activity relationships would facilitate interpretation of how Nec&#8208;1 can selectively target and regulate A&#946; and tau aggregation. Moreover, prophylactic effects of Nec&#8208;1 may be limited to early stages of AD, based on the clinical failures of previous drug candidates inhibiting A&#946;/tau abnormalities or brain cell death. Besides Nec&#8208;1 activity, we also observed the bimolecular binding between RIP kinase and A&#946;. Interaction between these two proteins in the extracellular and luminal regions might provide A&#946;&#8208;related cell death pathology in AD and also provide a potential drug target for the disease. Given that RIPK1/RIPK3 complex exhibits classical characteristics of amyloid aggregation, it is possible to predict that amyloidogenic properties of RIPK3 and A&#946; attract each other. Additional studies are warranted to investigate whether the therapeutic effect of Nec&#8208;1 will translate into an intervention that might be potentially useful for AD.</text>

      <text>The passive avoidance test was performed 3&#160;days after the Y&#8208;maze test. The apparatus consisted of a box divided into a bright compartment and a darker compartment with a grid floor. Each mouse was tested on two consecutive days. On the first day of testing, the training trial, each mouse was placed in the illuminated chamber and allowed to explore for 20&#160;s. After 20&#160;s, the wooden door between the light and dark compartments was opened. When the mouse entered the dark chamber with all four paws, the door closed and a foot shock (0.3&#160;mA, 2&#160;s, once) was delivered through the grid. The mouse was returned to its home cage. After 24&#160;h, the second day of testing, each mouse was returned to the light chamber. When the mouse entered the dark chamber, the door was closed, and the step&#8208;through latency was measured with a cut&#8208;off time of 300&#160;s.

      <text>After behavioural tests, the brains of the wild&#8208;type and APP/PS1 mice were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4). The fixed brain samples were then immersed in 30% sucrose for cryoprotection and cut into 30&#8208;&#956;m&#8208;thick slices using a Cryostat (Microm HM 525, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The sliced brains were stained with 500 &#956;M of thioflavin S (ThS) dissolved in 50% ethanol for 7&#160;min. The sections were then rinsed with 100, 95, 70% ethanol and PBS successively. For immunostaining, the slides were stained with anti&#8208;A&#946; monoclonal antibody (1:100 dilution, clone 6E10, Catalog SIG&#8208;39320, Covance), anti&#8208;GFAP polyclonal antibody (1:300 dilution, Catalog AB5541, Millipore Corporation) and anti&#8208;tau (phospho&#8208;Ser199) antibody (1:100 dilution, Catalog ab81268, Abcam). Alexa Fluor 488&#8208; or Alexa Fluor 568&#8208;conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) were used for fluorescence detection. Hoechst 33342 (Sigma&#8208;Aldrich) was used for the visualization of nuclei. Images were taken on a Leica DM2500 fluorescence microscope (Li et&#160;al, 2007).</text>

      <text>After behavioural tests, the cortical and hippocampal regions were dissected separately from brains of wild&#8208;type and APP/PS1 mice. Brain tissues were then homogenized in RIPA buffer (20&#160;mM Tris&#8211;HCl, pH 7.5, 50&#160;mM NaCl, 0.5% NP&#8208;40, 4&#160;mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and protease inhibitor cocktail) on ice for 15&#160;min and centrifuged at 16,000 g, at 4&#176;C for 30&#160;min. The supernatant of brain lysates was then used for Western blot and dot blot analysis. The concentrations of lysates were quantified by BCA assay. For Western blot analysis, the brain lysates (20 &#956;g) were subjected to SDS&#8211;PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. 20&#160;&#956;g of brain lysates were spotted for the dot blot analysis to detect amyloidogenic protein oligomer and A&#946;. Membranes were treated with primary antibodies (1:1,000 dilution) overnight at 4&#176;C and were detected by horseradish peroxidase&#8208;conjugated secondary antibodies. Blots were developed with the Clarity Western ECL Substrate (Bio&#8208;Rad) following the manufacturer's instructions.</text>

      <text>The surface plasmon resonance analysis was performed using Biacore T200 instrument and Series S carboxymethylated (CM5) dextran matrix sensor chips (GE Healthcare) (Richter et&#160;al, 2010). HBS&#8208;EP+ (10&#160;mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150&#160;mM NaCl, 3&#160;mM EDTA and 0.05% surfactant P20) was used as a running buffer at 25&#176;C. A&#946;(1&#8211;42) aggregates (200&#160;&#956;g/ml) and tau (1&#160;mg/ml) were diluted with 10&#160;mM sodium acetate solution (pH 4.0 and pH 5.5, respectively) to make 40&#160;&#956;g/ml of A&#946;(1&#8211;42) aggregates and 25&#160;&#956;g/ml of tau. Then, they were covalently immobilized on the chip surface by amine coupling chemistry. The remaining activated carboxymethyl groups on the surface were blocked by injection of 1&#160;M ethanolamine (pH 8.0). Immobilization values of A&#946;(1&#8211;42) aggregates and tau were 6,000 RU and 1,400 RU, and theoretical Rmax of A&#946;(1&#8211;42) aggregates and tau were 386 RU and 29 RU, respectively. Nec&#8208;1 was prepared in PBS&#8208;T running buffer (10&#160;mM phosphate, 135&#160;mM NaCl, 27&#160;mM KCl and 0.005% surfactant P20) containing 1% DMSO as serial&#8208;diluted samples. For the binding and&#160;kinetics assay, Nec&#8208;1 was injected for 120 s at a flow rate of 30&#160;&#956;l/min.</text>

      <text>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with multiple putative therapeutic targets. Abnormal A&#946; and Tau species are considered to be strong candidates for the development and progression of AD, but by which exact mechanisms remain unclear. Thus, most of the currently available drugs are aimed at providing more practical benefits to mask the cognitive symptoms of AD in patients. However, without affecting the underlying causes of AD, the disease will not be delayed or ultimately treated. It is also challenging to develop AD therapeutics aimed at the symptomatic stage given that A&#946; and Tau abnormalities begin in pre&#8208;symptomatic stage, followed by irreversible neural cell death, but before outward cognitive impairments are observed in patients. Means to modulate brain atrophy prophylactically could be an interesting strategy against AD.</text>

      <text>In this study, we report that Nec&#8208;1, which was originally identified as a necroptosis inhibitor, is capable of targeting multiple hallmarks of AD from pathophysiological changes to behavioural outcomes. Nec&#8208;1 is found to directly interact with A&#946; aggregates and prevent A&#946;&#8208;induced neural cell death in&#160;vitro when different types of neural cells were pre&#8208;treated with Nec&#8208;1 before the addition of A&#946; aggregates in the culture media. The study also provides in&#160;vivo evidence that i.v. injection of Nec&#8208;1 before the onset of AD&#8208;like phenotypes significantly reduces A&#946; oligomers, plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau in the cortex and hippocampus, alters apoptotic marker protein expression levels and inhibits cognitive impairments in AD mouse models.</text>
