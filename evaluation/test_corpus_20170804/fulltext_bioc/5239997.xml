      <text>SHARPIN is a widely expressed multifunctional protein implicated in cancer, inflammation, linear ubiquitination and integrin activity inhibition; however, its contribution to epithelial homeostasis remains poorly understood. Here, we examined the role of SHARPIN in mammary gland development, a process strongly regulated by epithelial&#8211;stromal interactions. Mice lacking SHARPIN expression in all cells (Sharpincpdm), and mice with a stromal (S100a4&#8208;Cre) deletion of Sharpin, have reduced mammary ductal outgrowth during puberty. In contrast, Sharpincpdm mammary epithelial cells transplanted in&#160;vivo into wild&#8208;type stroma, fully repopulate the mammary gland fat pad, undergo unperturbed ductal outgrowth and terminal differentiation. Thus, SHARPIN is required in mammary gland stroma during development. Accordingly, stroma adjacent to invading mammary ducts of Sharpincpdm mice displayed reduced collagen arrangement and extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness. Moreover, Sharpincpdm mammary gland stromal fibroblasts demonstrated defects in collagen fibre assembly, collagen contraction and degradation in&#160;vitro. Together, these data imply that SHARPIN regulates the normal invasive mammary gland branching morphogenesis in an epithelial cell extrinsic manner by controlling the organisation of the stromal ECM.</text>

      <text>The mammary gland develops post&#8208;natally in response to growth and steroid hormones, and local growth factors. During mammary ductal elongation and branching morphogenesis, the pubertal mammary epithelium invades into the fat pad stroma to form the gland that later evolves further during the menstrual cycle, and terminally differentiates/dedifferentiates during pregnancy, lactation and involution. Mammary ductal outgrowth takes place at the tips of the ducts, in the terminal end buds (TEBs). Here, in areas of active cell division, hollow ducts are formed through luminal apoptosis, and cells undergo differentiation into luminal and basal mammary epithelial layers (Hinck &amp; Silberstein, 2005; Ewald et&#160;al, 2008). Complex signalling between the epithelium and the stroma orchestrates the mammary ductal outgrowth and branching through the adipose tissue (Sternlicht et&#160;al, 2006; Howard &amp; Lu, 2014). This process involves significant regulation of the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) (Zhu et&#160;al, 2014; Gomes et&#160;al, 2015). Epithelial cell adhesion to the surrounding ECM via integrins, heterodimeric transmembrane adhesion receptors, plays an important role in mammary ductal outgrowth (Klinowska et&#160;al, 1999), in preserving the regenerative capacity of the mammary epithelium (Taddei et&#160;al, 2008), and during breast cancer invasion and metastasis (Levental et&#160;al, 2009). However, the signalling pathways that regulate mammary gland stromal cell adhesion and collagen architecture, and thereby ductal outgrowth, are largely unknown.</text>

      <text>SHARPIN (Shank&#8208;associated RH domain&#8208;interacting protein, also known as SIPL1) binds to intracellular integrin alpha tails of inactive integrins and inhibits recruitment of talin and kindlin to the beta tail, thereby functioning as an integrin inhibitor (Rantala et&#160;al, 2011; Pouwels et&#160;al, 2013; De Franceschi et&#160;al, 2015). SHARPIN is also an essential component of the linear ubiquitination assembly complex (LUBAC) (Gerlach et&#160;al, 2011; Ikeda et&#160;al, 2011; Tokunaga et&#160;al, 2011) that regulates canonical nuclear factor&#8208;&#954;B (NF&#8208;&#954;B) signalling in response to cytokines, bacteria and genotoxic stress through linear ubiquitination (Gerlach et&#160;al, 2011; Tokunaga et&#160;al, 2011; Fujita et&#160;al, 2014). Furthermore, SHARPIN is involved in negative regulation of T&#8208;cell receptor signalling (Park et&#160;al, 2016), priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex in macrophages (Rodgers et&#160;al, 2014; Gurung et&#160;al, 2015), and it has been reported to bind and regulate key signalling proteins such as eyes absent homolog 1 (EYA1) (Landgraf et&#160;al, 2010), SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains protein (SHANK) (Lim et&#160;al, 2001), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) (He et&#160;al, 2010). SHARPIN&#8208;deficient (Sharpincpdm) mice display defective secondary lymphoid organ development (HogenEsch et&#160;al, 1993; Seymour et&#160;al, 2013) and suffer from progressive multiorgan inflammation with chronic eosinophilic hyperproliferative dermatitis due to increased tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)&#8208;mediated keratinocyte apoptosis (Seymour et&#160;al, 2007; Gerlach et&#160;al, 2011; Rickard et&#160;al, 2014). Increased SHARPIN expression has previously been linked to prostate tumorigenesis (He et&#160;al, 2010; Li et&#160;al, 2015), elevated breast cancer risk (De Melo &amp; Tang, 2015) and breast cancer metastasis (Bii et&#160;al, 2015), suggesting a role for SHARPIN in regulating epithelial homeostasis. Many of the molecular features driving invasive breast carcinoma are also essential during normal mammary ductal outgrowth, including collective cell migration, ECM remodelling and epithelial&#8211;stromal communication (Polyak &amp; Kalluri, 2010). The potential involvement of SHARPIN in processes related to breast cancer invasion and metastasis prompted us to investigate post&#8208;natal mammary gland development in Sharpincpdm mice. Here, we report that Sharpincpdm mice have defective mammary ductal outgrowth during puberty and demonstrate an epithelial cell extrinsic requirement for SHARPIN in regulating normal stromal collagen architecture and stiffness. Accordingly, Sharpincpdm fibroblasts demonstrate an inability to generate traction forces on collagen and to assemble, contract and degrade collagen fibres.</text>

      <text>To examine the expression of SHARPIN in the mammary gland, paraffin&#8208;embedded human tissue sections were stained by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Fig&#160;1A). SHARPIN expression was detected in the luminal epithelial cell layer and in the scattered stromal cells, but not in the basal epithelial cells directly adhering to the basal lamina (Fig&#160;1A). Co&#8208;staining of SHARPIN with vimentin confirmed that the majority of the SHARPIN&#8208;positive stromal cells were spindle&#8208;shaped and vimentin expressing fibroblasts (Fig&#160;EV1A). For further characterisation, mouse mammary gland epithelial cells (MECs) and mammary gland stromal fibroblasts (MSFs) were isolated, and the expression of SHARPIN was analysed by Western blotting (Fig&#160;1B). SHARPIN was expressed at the protein level in both mammary gland primary cell populations although more prominently in the epithelial portion (Fig&#160;1B). The specific expression of CDH1 (also called E&#8208;cadherin), detected as a double band (upper band represents the unprocessed receptor form) (Fujita et&#160;al, 2002), in the epithelial cells and vimentin in the stromal cells confirmed the purity of the two populations (Fig&#160;1B). MECs and MSFs were further sorted by flow cytometry to basal epithelial, luminal epithelial (progenitors/mature) and stromal populations based on CD24 and ICAM1 surface expressions (Di&#8208;Cicco et&#160;al, 2015; Fig&#160;1C). Lineage&#8208;specific marker mRNA expression [basal, keratin 5 (Krt5); luminal, keratin 18 (Krt18); stromal, Pdgfra] was controlled by quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Fig&#160;EV1B). Sharpin mRNA expression was low in basal epithelial cells (LinnegCD24intICAM1hi), higher in luminal progenitor (LinnegCD24hi ICAM1int) and mature luminal epithelial cells (LinnegCD24hi ICAM1neg) and highest in stromal fibroblasts (LinnegCD24neg) when measured by qPCR (Fig&#160;1D). Taken together, our results show that SHARPIN mRNA and protein are expressed both in the epithelial and in the stromal cells of the mouse mammary gland.</text>

      <text>Mammary ductal morphogenesis in pubertal female mice has been previously investigated to identify mechanisms potentially hijacked by breast cancer cells for adhesion, invasion and metastasis (Lanigan et&#160;al, 2007; Polyak &amp; Kalluri, 2010). As SHARPIN is expressed in the&#160;mammary gland (Fig&#160;1) and is known to regulate both cell adhesion (Rantala et&#160;al, 2011) and breast cancer metastasis (Bii et&#160;al, 2015; De Melo &amp; Tang, 2015), we hypothesised that SHARPIN could play an important role during mammary ductal outgrowth. To examine this, the 4th mammary glands were isolated from 3&#8208; to 7&#8208;week&#8208;old female wt and SHARPIN&#8208;deficient (Sharpincpdm) mice (Figs&#160;2A and EV2A), and ductal outgrowth and branching were quantified from carmine alum&#8208;stained whole mounts (Fig&#160;2B and C). While the ductal trees of the pre&#8208;pubertal 3&#8208; to 4&#8208;week&#8208;old mice were equal in size, a clear reduction in ductal outgrowth area was observed in the Sharpincpdm mammary glands at puberty (5&#8211;7&#160;weeks old; Fig&#160;2A and B), indicating impaired pubertal (allometric) mammary growth. Additionally, the number of ductal branches per gland was significantly lower in pubertal Sharpincpdm mice (Fig&#160;2C). These differences were not attributed to disturbances in the onset of puberty in the Sharpincpdm mice, as it occurred normally close to 5&#160;weeks of age similarly to their wt female littermate controls, as judged based on the evaluation of vaginal opening (Fig&#160;EV2B). Furthermore, oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor expressions were similar in both wt and Sharpincpdm mammary glands indicative of normal systemic steroid hormone production at puberty (Fig&#160;EV2C). The polarity of the mammary ductal cell layers was also similar in wt and Sharpincpdm mice as examined by hematoxylin&#8208;eosin (HE) and IHC labelling of luminal (CDH1) and basal (integrin alpha 6; ITGA6) epithelial cells from histological sections of 7&#8208;week&#8208;old mouse mammary glands (Fig&#160;2D).</text>

      <text>As TEBs of the mammary ductal epithelium are known to be responsible for ductal growth and invasion through the mammary fat pad (Hinck &amp; Silberstein, 2005), the number of TEBs in wt and Sharpincpdm mouse mammary gland whole mounts was analysed (Fig&#160;2E). The number of Sharpincpdm TEBs was reduced (Fig&#160;2F), likely reflecting the reduced ductal growth and branching. In histological sections, the overall cellular organisation of the Sharpincpdm TEBs was normal (Fig&#160;2G), and similar numbers of proliferating (BrdU&#8208;positive) and apoptotic (cleaved caspase&#8208;3&#8208;positive) cells were observed in wt and Sharpincpdm mammary gland TEBs (Fig&#160;EV2D). Together, these data show that the Sharpincpdm mammary gland has reduced ductal outgrowth in&#160;vivo suggesting a previously unknown role for SHARPIN in the regulation of mammary branching morphogenesis.</text>

      <text>Since SHARPIN expression was detected in the mature luminal and luminal progenitor cells in the mouse mammary gland, and only at low level in basal epithelial cells (Fig&#160;1D), we postulated that SHARPIN deficiency could affect mammary epithelial regeneration and differentiation. To investigate this, MECs were isolated from pubertal wt and Sharpincpdm mice and surface labelled to detect CD24 expression in combination with CD29 (integrin beta 1) or CD49f (integrin alpha 6) and quantified basal epithelial (LinnegCD24intCD29+ or LinnegCD24intCD49f+) and luminal epithelial (LinnegCD24hiCD29neg or LinnegCD24hiCD49fneg) cell populations (Taddei et&#160;al, 2008) (Fig&#160;EV2E). Interestingly, both labelling strategies indicated that 50&#8211;60% of the MEC population expressed luminal and 30&#8211;40% basal markers in both wt and&#160;Sharpincpdm samples (Fig&#160;EV2E), demonstrating that the Sharpincpdm mammary epithelium has normal proportions of basal and luminal epithelial cells.</text>

      <text>Next, to conclusively evaluate whether Sharpincpdm mammary epithelium retained normal regenerative capacity, indicative of normal stem cell population, small pieces of wt or Sharpincpdm mammary glands were transplanted into virgin wt recipients' cleared (epithelium&#8208;free) mammary fat pads (Fig&#160;3A). Ductal outgrowth from transplants was evaluated from mammary gland whole mounts 7&#8211;11&#160;weeks after transplantation. The Sharpincpdm (donor) epithelium was able to fully regenerate the mammary gland in the wt (recipient) stroma (Fig&#160;3A and B) and invade into the fat pad to a similar extent as the wt donor epithelium (Fig&#160;3C). To evaluate the role of SHARPIN in terminal differentiation of the mammary gland, virgin wt mice were transplanted with wt or Sharpincpdm mammary epithelium and mated 10&#160;weeks post&#8208;transplantation. Mammary gland whole mounts were prepared 15&#160;days after conception (P15; Fig&#160;3D). In five out of six transplants of both genotypes, mammary epithelium was able to regenerate and undergo tertiary branching and alveologenesis during pregnancy, when grown in wt mammary stroma (Figs&#160;3D and EV2F), demonstrating that epithelial SHARPIN is dispensable for terminal differentiation of the mammary gland. Due to the reduced lifespan of the Sharpincpdm mice (Potter et&#160;al, 2014), the reciprocal transplantation of wt epithelium into Sharpincpdm recipients was not feasible. Together, our data demonstrate that wt fat pad stroma is able to support mammary ductal growth and branching, as well as the terminal differentiation of the Sharpincpdm epithelium, suggesting that SHARPIN deficiency is predominantly affecting the mammary stromal compartment.</text>

      <text>The stroma of the developing mammary gland is composed of several different cell types (including fibroblasts, endothelial cells and leukocytes), which undergo complex dialog with the invading mammary epithelium (Reed &amp; Schwertfeger, 2010; Howard &amp; Lu, 2014). Macrophages, eosinophils, mast cells and lymphocytes have previously been shown to regulate mammary branching morphogenesis (Gouon&#8208;Evans et&#160;al, 2000; Lilla &amp; Werb, 2010; Plaks et&#160;al, 2015). Significantly more leukocytes (CD45+), neutrophils (CD11b+Ly6Ghi), eosinophils (CD11b+Siglec Fhi) and macrophages (CD11b+F4/80+) were detected in the pubertal mammary gland of Sharpincpdm mice compared to wt animals (Fig&#160;EV3A and B), which is consistent with the Sharpincpdm multiorgan inflammation phenotype (HogenEsch et&#160;al, 1993; Seymour et&#160;al, 2007). While the increase in neutrophils (+65%) and macrophages (+51%) was similar to the increase in total pool of mammary gland leukocytes (+35%) in Sharpincpdm mice, the proportion of eosinophils (+331%) was clearly higher in the Sharpincpdm mouse mammary gland (Fig&#160;EV3A and B). However, angiogenesis, measured by PECAM1 IHC, was similar in wt and Sharpincpdm mammary gland stroma (Fig&#160;EV3C).</text>

      <text>To evaluate further the role of stromal SHARPIN in the regulation of mammary ductal outgrowth, a conditional Sharpin knockout in stromal cells was generated using the S100 Calcium Binding Protein A4 (S100a4), commonly known as the fibroblast&#8208;specific protein&#8208;1 (FSp1), promoter for Cre expression. The S100a4 promoter has also previously been used for conditional knockout and selective gene expression in the mammary gland stroma (Cheng et&#160;al, 2005; Trimboli et&#160;al, 2009; O'Connell et&#160;al, 2011; Pickup et&#160;al, 2015; Koledova et&#160;al, 2016). S100a4 expression was detected in lysates of isolated wt and Sharpincpdm mammary gland fibroblasts by Western blotting (Fig&#160;EV4A) and by IHC labelling of the mammary gland stroma (Fig&#160;EV4C). No S100a4 expression was detected in the mammary epithelium (Fig&#160;EV4C). Importantly, expression of Sharpin mRNA was specifically reduced in the S100a4&#8208;Cre; Sharpinfl/fl mammary gland stromal cells surrounding the mammary ducts when compared to S100a4&#8208;Cre; Sharpinfl/+ control (Fig&#160;EV4B). Consistent with our transplantation results, mouse mammary ductal outgrowth and number of TEBs were reduced when Sharpin was deleted specifically in stromal cells (Fig&#160;3E&#8211;G). Comparable numbers of F4/80&#8208;positive cells (macrophages and eosinophils) were detected around invading TEBs in S100a4&#8208;Cre; Sharpinfl/fl and control mice, while elevated density of F4/80 expressing cells was observed in Sharpincpdm samples (Fig&#160;EV4D). Our findings demonstrate that SHARPIN in stromal fibroblasts rather than in epithelial cells is an important regulator of mammary gland ductal outgrowth.</text>

      <text>In addition to the many secreted signals originating from the stromal cells (Sternlicht et&#160;al, 2006), the pattern of extracellular collagen fibre deposition has been suggested to function as an important guide for mammary ductal outgrowth and branching morphogenesis that are known to occur under strict spatial regulation (Hovey et&#160;al, 2002; Ingman et&#160;al, 2006; Brownfield et&#160;al, 2013). Multiphoton laser scanning microscopy and second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging enable label&#8208;free visualisation and analysis of the collagen&#8208;rich ECM in tissues in&#160;vivo and in&#160;vitro. This technique was utilised to view the stromal collagen fibres proximal to the invading mammary epithelium in wt and Sharpincpdm pubertal mouse mammary gland whole mounts. SHG imaging revealed that in the Sharpincpdm stroma individual collagen fibres around TEBs appeared less organised compared to corresponding areas in wt samples (Fig&#160;4A). Quantification of the SHG signal by scoring maximum intensity projection images for the presence of clear collagen bundles (as opposed to mesh&#8208;like or &#8220;curly&#8221; collagen fibres) demonstrated that distinct collagen bundles were significantly less abundant around the Sharpincpdm TEBs (Fig&#160;4B). Furthermore, fibre extraction image analysis (Fig&#160;EV4E) revealed that Sharpincpdm collagen fibres had a tendency to be shorter and thicker than wt fibres, particularly when the longest collagen fibres (&gt;&#160;75.8&#160;&#956;m) were examined (although the results were not statistically significant; Fig&#160;EV4F and G). Other measured parameters, such as the overall alignment or straightness of the collagen fibres, did not show any similar trend in Sharpincpdm mammary gland stroma (data not shown). These data suggest that stromal collagen patterning is altered in the absence of SHARPIN, which may impair the ECM cues for mammary epithelial outgrowth.</text>

      <text>Atomic&#8208;force microscopy (AFM) analyses revealed a tissue stiffness in the range of 0.1&#8211;1&#160;kPa (Fig&#160;4C) for the wt mammary gland stroma, comparable to previously published data (Lopez et&#160;al, 2011; Plodinec et&#160;al, 2012). Interestingly, the Sharpincpdm mammary fat pad stroma at corresponding fat pad regions was clearly softer compared to wt samples (P&#160;=&#160;8.82e&#8211;08; Fig&#160;4C) potentially reflecting the altered collagen fibre architecture observed in Sharpincpdm mice. However, we cannot formally exclude that the difference in stromal stiffness is secondary to the mammary ductal outgrowth defect in Sharpincpdm mice. Such differences were not detected in pre&#8208;pubertal wt and Sharpincpdm mammary fat pad stroma at the age of 4&#160;weeks when ductal outgrowth is still comparable in both genotypes (P&#160;=&#160;0.0963; Fig&#160;EV4H). Our results provide evidence that SHARPIN positively regulates mammary gland stromal tissue stiffness and affects collagen arrangement in&#160;vivo.</text>

      <text>Mammary gland stromal fibroblasts were studied further in&#160;vitro due to their established role in ECM remodelling. First, the global mRNA expression patterns in isolated and in&#160;vitro cultured wt and Sharpincpdm primary MSFs (passage 0) were compared (Figs&#160;5A and EV5A and B, and Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S1) with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Significant alterations in canonical pathways related to leukocyte adhesion and transmigration, and tissue fibrosis (P&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05) were detected in Sharpincpdm MSFs, indicating an important role for SHARPIN in processes associated with immune cell chemotaxis and ECM remodelling (Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S1). Among the differentially expressed genes in this category were several previously identified target genes of the TNF signalling pathway (Agt, Agtr1, Ccl22, Cdh5, Col4a3, Cxcl10, Cxcl3, Cxcr4, Cxcr5, Ednrb, Figf, Icam2, Igfbp4, Il1b, Il1r2, Il1rl1, Lbp, Mmp13, Mmp2, Mmp3, Mmp8, Mmp9, Pecam1 and Selp), likely related to the well&#8208;documented role of SHARPIN in the LUBAC complex (Gerlach et&#160;al, 2011; Ikeda et&#160;al, 2011; Tokunaga et&#160;al, 2011), several collagen genes (upregulated: Col10a1; downregulated: Col23a1, Col4a3, Col6a6, Col24a1, Col13a1 and Col25a1) and multiple collagenases (upregulated: Mmp9; downregulated: Mmp2, Mmp3, Mmp8 and Mmp13) (Fig&#160;5A). As the proteolytic degradation of fibrillar collagen by stromal matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) is an important step in mammary ductal outgrowth and branching (Wiseman et&#160;al, 2003), we investigated whether collagen degradation was compromised in Sharpincpdm MSFs with reduced MMP expression. MSFs, isolated from wt and Sharpincpdm mice, were plated on fluorogenic fibrillar DQ&#8482; collagen&#8208;coated crossbow&#8208;shaped micropatterns, to constrain cell shape and allow cell polarisation (Thery et&#160;al, 2006), and collagen degradation was monitored. Indeed, Sharpincpdm MSFs displayed diminished collagenolytic activity as indicated by a lower fluorescence signal (Fig&#160;5B). These data demonstrate that SHARPIN influences the expression of both collagens and collagen&#8208;degrading enzymes, most likely reflecting the altered stromal environment observed in&#160;vivo.</text>

      <text>In connective tissue, fibroblasts generate traction forces and reorganise collagen fibres in response to mechanical and chemical cues (Tschumperlin, 2013). To investigate how SHARPIN deficiency affects the capacity of cells to contract collagen in&#160;vitro, MSFs were seeded inside a floating 3D collagen plug (Fig&#160;5C). Indeed, Sharpincpdm MSFs were significantly less capable of contracting collagen, compared to wt MSFs (Fig&#160;5C and D). Similar results were obtained with the partial silencing of SHARPIN achievable in these primary cells, as Sharpin siRNA also significantly reduced collagen contraction of wt cells (Fig&#160;5D and E). As mechanical forces are required for large&#8208;scale collagen contraction, we also analysed how SHARPIN deficiency influenced the traction forces exerted by MSFs on the microenvironment. To this end, the cells were plated on collagen&#8208;coated hydrogels (1.1&#160;kPa) and imaged by traction force microscopy (Fig&#160;5F and G). As expected, wt cells created significantly higher traction stresses than Sharpincpdm cells (Fig&#160;5F) indicating a difference in the ability of the cells to apply mechanical force (strain energy, Fig&#160;5G) on the substrate in the absence of SHARPIN. Importantly, traction force generation (on 1.8&#160;kPa gels) was rescued to wt level by ectopic expression of SHARPIN&#8208;mCherry in Sharpincpdm mammary gland fibroblasts (Fig&#160;5H and I).</text>

      <text>The relative activity of integrin beta 1 heterodimers that bind cells to collagen and mediate cell traction was elevated in Sharpincpdm MSFs compared to wt cells when measured by an active integrin beta 1 conformation&#8208;specific antibody and flow cytometry (Fig&#160;EV5C), suggesting that the negative regulation of integrin activity by SHARPIN might play a role in traction force generation (Rantala et&#160;al, 2011). Sharpincpdm mammary gland fibroblasts also activated focal adhesion&#8208;induced signalling [phosphorylation of protein tyrosine kinase 2 (PTK2), also called focal adhesion kinase (FAK)] more rapidly than wt cells (Fig&#160;EV5D and E) indicative of faster formation and maturation of focal adhesions. Furthermore, our analysis of focal adhesion dynamics by live cell total internal reflection (TIRF) imaging of GFP&#8208;paxillin expressing cells on collagen revealed that Sharpincpdm cells form on average larger focal adhesions and have faster focal adhesion assembly and disassembly rates (Fig&#160;5J and K), suggesting that SHARPIN deficiency leads to abnormal cell adhesion dynamics and compromised traction force generation.</text>

      <text>To indirectly analyse the capability of Sharpincpdm MSFs to convert newly synthesised collagen into insoluble fibrillar collagen, the amount of acid&#8208;soluble collagen in wt and Sharpincpdm MSF cultures was measured by Sirius red assay (Marotta &amp; Martino, 1985; Tullberg&#8208;Reinert &amp; Jundt, 1999). Similar assays have previously demonstrated that during the first 2&#160;days, fibroblasts produce an increasing amount of soluble collagen in the culture medium and starting from day 4, soluble collagen levels decline, and deposition of fibrillar collagen increases (Chen et&#160;al, 2013). Despite initially lower levels of soluble collagen production in Sharpincpdm MSFs when compared and normalised to wt values (Fig&#160;6A), the Sharpincpdm culture media contained significantly more soluble collagen than wt media on day 7 post&#8208;plating (Fig&#160;6A). These data indirectly suggest a defect in fibrillar collagen deposition in the absence of SHARPIN (Fig&#160;6A). Fibroblasts, in&#160;vitro, are capable of producing a cell&#8208;derived matrix (CDM) composed of fibrillar collagen, fibronectin and laminin, closely resembling the in&#160;vivo ECM (Cukierman et&#160;al, 2001). Immunofluorescence (IF) labelling of collagen I revealed that distinct collagen bundles were the predominant form of collagen in the CDM produced by wt MSFs (Fig&#160;6B and C), whereas cells isolated from Sharpincpdm mice more frequently produced CDM consisting only of a collagen fibre mesh (Fig&#160;6B and C). These in&#160;vitro data recapitulate the less organised stromal phenotype observed in&#160;vivo by SHG imaging of the collagen ECM in Sharpincpdm mouse mammary glands (Fig&#160;4A and B). Our data suggest that in addition to affecting traction force generation, SHARPIN supports ECM remodelling by regulating fibroblast&#8208;mediated fibrillar collagen assembly and degradation in the mammary gland.</text>

      <text>Breast cancer&#8208;associated changes in ECM structure and stiffness promote invasion and metastasis (Schedin &amp; Keely, 2011; Acerbi et&#160;al, 2015; Robertson, 2015). However, it is unclear how changes in stromal cell activity translate into alterations in the ECM structure, and which molecules are involved in this process. Mammary gland branching morphogenesis has been used as a developmental model system to decipher the mechanisms of collective cell invasion and epithelial&#8211;stromal crosstalk (Howard &amp; Lu, 2014; Zhu et&#160;al, 2014). Here, we show that Sharpincpdm mice lacking SHARPIN, a protein involved in the regulation of NF&#8208;&#954;gr;B signalling and integrin activity regulation among other functions, have impaired mammary ductal outgrowth during puberty. The Sharpincpdm mouse phenotype stems from an abnormal stromal environment where collagen distribution is altered and tissue stiffness is reduced. We find that SHARPIN is required for cell traction force generation on collagen matrices and for collagen fibre assembly, contraction and degradation by MSFs. The importance of SHARPIN in these ECM&#8208;related remodelling processes is reflected in&#160;vivo in Sharpincpdm mice that demonstrate reduced stromal stiffness during mouse mammary ductal outgrowth.</text>

      <text>In mouse mammary epithelium that lacks the inhibitor of kappaB alpha gene, increased NF&#8208;&#954;gr;B signalling triggers excessive cell proliferation and ductal branching when transplanted into wt fat pads (Brantley et&#160;al, 2001). The data presented here demonstrate that Sharpincpdm mammary epithelium, with a potential reduction in NF&#8208;&#954;gr;B signalling due to impaired LUBAC function (Gerlach et&#160;al, 2011; Tokunaga et&#160;al, 2011; Fujita et&#160;al, 2014), develops normally in the wt fat pad. Furthermore, deletion of Sharpin specifically from stromal cells using the S100a4 promoter impairs mammary ductal outgrowth, suggesting that epithelial SHARPIN is not required for normal mammary gland branching morphogenesis. Instead, SHARPIN might play a role in TNF&#8208;induced NF&#8208;&#954;gr;B signalling in the mammary gland stromal cells. For example, TNF has been shown to increase the expression of pro&#8208;tumorigenic chemokines via NF&#8208;&#954;gr;B in breast cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (Katanov et&#160;al, 2015).</text>

      <text>We also observed increased accumulation of innate leukocytes in the mammary glands of Sharpincpdm mice. Since the lack of macrophages in CSF1&#8208;deficient mice and the lack of eosinophils in eotaxin&#8208;deficient mice lead to defective mammary branching morphogenesis (Gouon&#8208;Evans et&#160;al, 2000), we find it unlikely that the enhanced leukocyte infiltration in the Sharpincpdm mice would critically contribute to the defective ductal invasion observed in these mice. However, increase in eosinophils may also affect branching morphogenesis, since interleukin&#8208;5 (IL5) transgenic mice (Tg(CD2&#8208;Il5)5C2Ldt) with a massive 265&#8208;fold increase in blood eosinophils (Dent et&#160;al, 1990) show mammary gland eosinophilia and delayed TEB formation, ductal branching and ductal elongation in puberty (Sferruzzi&#8208;Perri et&#160;al, 2003). Nevertheless, we observed impaired mammary fat pad invasion also in the presence of normal numbers of eosinophils and macrophages in S100a4&#8208;Cre; Sharpinfl/fl mice. Fibroblast&#8208;specific transgene expression in&#160;vivo is complicated by the lack of naturally occurring lineage&#8208;specific marker genes, and in this study, we chose to use one of the most specific and commonly used promoters, the S100a4 promoter, for Cre expression (Bhowmick et&#160;al, 2004). In addition to being expressed in fibroblasts of the mammary gland (Cheng et&#160;al, 2005; Trimboli et&#160;al, 2009; Pickup et&#160;al, 2015; Koledova et&#160;al, 2016), kidney (Strutz et&#160;al, 1995), lung (Lawson et&#160;al, 2005) and skin (Osterreicher et&#160;al, 2011), the S100a4 promoter is also expressed in liver macrophages (Osterreicher et&#160;al, 2011), and kidney interstitial leukocytes (Le Hir et&#160;al, 2005). Thus, although our data collectively suggest that the defects in stromal fibroblasts may be the primary contributor to the Sharpincpdm mammary gland phenotype, the specific contributions of SHARPIN in mammary gland fibroblasts and the stromal immune cells during mammary gland ductal invasion in&#160;vivo remain to be formally studied.</text>

      <text>The mammary gland ECM is subject to change during development, pregnancy and lactation, and upon formation of breast tumours (Schedin &amp; Keely, 2011). Numerous genes expressed in the mouse mammary epithelium have been identified as important regulators of mammary gland morphogenesis, but only relatively few studies have analysed the contribution of stromal&#8208;dependent ECM regulation. In pubertal mice, stromal macrophages promote mammary ductal outgrowth (Gouon&#8208;Evans et&#160;al, 2000) and regulate the shape of TEBs as well as the surrounding collagen fibrillogenesis (Ingman et&#160;al, 2006). Furthermore, the patterning of collagen fibres in the mammary gland stroma was found to regulate the orientation of TEBs during branching morphogenesis (Brownfield et&#160;al, 2013). Our data show that SHARPIN is involved in regulating ECM stiffness and collagen arrangement in the developing mammary gland stroma in&#160;vivo. In addition, Sharpincpdm MSFs have reduced capacity to contract and organise collagen in&#160;vitro. Thus, SHARPIN plays an important role in regulating collagen ECM in the mammary gland.</text>

      <text>Mammary stromal MMP&#8208;2 expression facilitates TEB invasion and represses precocious lateral branching, while MMP&#8208;3 regulates secondary branching during mid&#8208;puberty (Wiseman et&#160;al, 2003). Furthermore, lack of stromal MMP&#8208;11 leads to decreased periductal collagen content and reduced ductal outgrowth (Tan et&#160;al, 2014). These studies highlight the importance of stromal collagen proteolysis for pubertal mouse mammary gland development. Reduced expression of several collagenases and impaired collagenase activity was observed in primary MSFs as a result of SHARPIN deficiency indicating that reduced mammary ductal branching and outgrowth in Sharpincpdm mice could be due to diminished stromal MMP activity. Some of the differentially expressed genes have also been linked to angiogenesis. However, there was no apparent difference in blood vessel density between wt and Sharpincpdm mammary glands, suggesting that the developmental defects were not secondary to impaired angiogenesis.</text>

      <text>The data presented here also demonstrate that SHARPIN deficiency triggers altered focal adhesion turnover and reduced traction force generation in MSFs plated on collagen. As integrins in focal adhesions couple the ECM to the actin cytoskeleton and mediate cellular force transmission (Schwarz &amp; Gardel, 2012), the ability of SHARPIN to inhibit integrin activity (Rantala et&#160;al, 2011) could represent an important regulatory step in focal adhesion dynamics and mechanotransduction. Recent data suggest that dynamic integrin regulation is required for effective matrix contraction as expression of constitutively active integrin beta 1 reduces cell traction force (Elloumi&#8208;Hannachi et&#160;al, 2015). In line with this, elevated integrin beta 1 heterodimer activity was observed in primary Sharpincpdm MSFs. Whether SHARPIN affects fibroblast traction forces directly via integrin regulation, or by other mechanisms regulated by this multifunctional protein, remains to be investigated.</text>

      <text>Pregnancy&#8208;induced changes in the stromal collagen content and stiffness protects rats from breast tumorigenesis (Maller et&#160;al, 2013). On the other hand, radial collagen alignment at the mammary tumour&#8208;stromal boundary is associated with increased local invasion in mice (Provenzano et&#160;al, 2006), and increased collagen fibre straightness, alignment and length in tumour&#8208;associated ECM correlate with poor prognosis in cancer patients (Conklin et&#160;al, 2011; Hanley et&#160;al, 2015). SHARPIN expression has been shown to correlate with disease grade, poor patient survival and metastasis in breast cancer (Bii et&#160;al, 2015; De Melo &amp; Tang, 2015). Reduced stiffness, altered collagen organisation and impaired epithelial invasion were observed in the Sharpincpdm mouse mammary gland suggesting that altered SHARPIN expression in cancer cells or cancer&#8208;associated stromal cells could also contribute to the previously reported changes in the breast tumour ECM (Conklin et&#160;al, 2011; Hanley et&#160;al, 2015). While our results show that SHARPIN regulates ECM in the mouse mammary gland stroma, the possible implications in cancer stroma remain to be studied.</text>

      <text>Taken together, our study identifies SHARPIN as a stromal regulator of mammary gland ductal outgrowth. SHARPIN loss correlates with reduced amount of collagen bundles in&#160;vivo and in&#160;vitro, and this is most likely linked to the inability of Sharpincpdm MSFs to contract, pull and degrade collagen ECM. Our findings indicate that SHARPIN regulates stromal collagen architecture and mammary ductal outgrowth during development and thereby provide new insight on the stromal mechanisms that may also regulate breast cancer cell invasion.</text>

For timed mating, mice were examined for mating plug appearance and sacrificed on P15. Female Sharpincpdm mice (homozygous for the cpdm allele) with the indicated age were used in the experiments with wild&#8208;type littermate controls (negative for the cpdm allele). The Sharpincpdm and wt mice had not established an oestrus cycle by the time samples were collected (maximum 49&#160;days old) and were therefore not synchronised for oestrus.</text>

      <text>For construction of mCherry&#8208;SHARPIN, the GFP in GFP&#8208;C1 (Clontech) was replaced with mCherry using primers introducing NheI and EcoRI restriction sites, resulting in pmCherry&#8208;C1. Subsequently, the human Sharpin coding sequence (with four silent mutations that render the mRNA insensitive to siRNA1) was amplified from the GFP&#8208;Sharpin expression vector (Rantala et&#160;al, 2011) using primers introducing EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites and cloned into pmCherry&#8208;C1, resulting in mCherry&#8208;Sharpin. Full&#8208;length paxillin (PXN) in pEGFPC2 vector was a gift from Vic Small (IMBA, Vienna, Austria).</text>

      <text>Primary MSFs were isolated from the mammary glands of 6&#8208; to 7&#8208;week&#8208;old virgin mice. Briefly, the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th mammary glands from 2 to 4 wt and Sharpincpdm mice were removed aseptically without lymph nodes, minced with surgical blades and incubated in a shaker for 2&#8211;3&#160;h at 37&#176;C in 25&#8211;30&#160;ml of digestion media [DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium)/F12, 5% foetal calf serum (FCS), 5&#160;&#956;g/ml insulin, 50&#160;&#956;g/ml gentamicin] containing 2&#160;mg/ml collagenase type XI (Sigma). Then, the cell suspensions were centrifugated 10&#160;min at 400&#160;g to eliminate floating fat cells. Cell pellets were resuspended in isolation media (DMEM/F12, 50&#160;&#956;g/ml gentamicin, pen/strep) with 20&#160;U/ml DNase I (Roche) and incubated for 3&#160;min at room temperature with occasional shaking. Cells were pelleted and disaggregated by pipetting up and down 10 times in 10&#160;ml of isolation media. After each round of pulse centrifugation at 400&#160;g, the supernatant containing single cells was collected and pooled. After four rounds of pulse centrifugation, the pellet containing mammary epithelial ducts was collected. Mouse MECs were trypsinised and pushed through a cell strainer (70&#160;&#956;m, 352350 BD Biosciences) to obtain single cells. The supernatants containing MSFs were also pelleted and resuspended in fibroblast growth media (DMEM/F12, 5% FCS, l&#8208;glutamine, pen/strep). Medium was replaced the following day to remove dead cells. Passages 1&#8211;4 were used in the experiments if not otherwise indicated, and at least two independent isolates of MSFs per genotype were used in each experiment. The MSF cell cultures were all adherent and homogeneous in appearance, expressed vimentin and did not express epithelial (CDH1) or endothelial (PECAM1) cell markers (data not shown).</text>

      <text>Traction force microscopy was performed as described in Elkhatib et&#160;al (2014), with minor modifications. Glass&#8208;bottom dishes (World Precision Instrument Inc.) were silanised with 3&#8208;aminopropyl&#8208;trimethoxysilane (Sigma&#8208;Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The dishes were washed extensively with water, and the glass surface was treated for 30&#160;min with 0.5% glutaraldehyde followed by a final wash. 40% acrylamide (47&#160;&#956;l) and 2% bis&#8208;acrylamide (7.5&#160;&#956;l or 25&#160;&#956;l) (Bio&#8208;Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA, USA) were mixed in PBS solution to a final volume of 250&#160;&#956;l to achieve a Young's modulus of approximately 1,100 and 1,750&#160;Pa, respectively, as experimentally measured by AFM indentation. For traction force measurements, FluoSphere bead solution (0.2&#160;&#956;m, 505&#8211;515&#160;nm; Invitrogen) was added at 8% volume and the mixture was briefly sonicated. Polymerisation was initiated by addition of 2.5&#160;&#956;l freshly prepared ammonium persulphate (10% w/v solution) and 0.5&#160;&#956;l of N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED). Immediately after initiation, the polyacrylamide solution (12&#160;&#956;l) was pipetted onto the glass&#8208;bottom dish, and a coverslip was quickly placed on top of the gel droplet and gently pressed down. After polymerisation, the gel was immersed in PBS for 10&#160;min, and then, the top coverslips were gently removed under PBS, followed by three washes with PBS for&#160;10&#160;min. Then, the gel surface was activated to allow for collagen&#160;coating by applying a solution containing 50&#160;mM Hepes pH&#160;7.5, 10&#160;mg/ml of 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;[3&#8208;dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) (Thermo Scientific) and 1&#160;mg/ml of Sulfo&#8208;SANPAH (Pierce) for 30&#160;min at RT. After the incubation, the cross&#8208;linker Sulfo&#8208;SANPAH was photo&#8208;activated by UV light for 10&#160;min. After several washes with PBS, the gels were coated with 20&#160;&#956;g/ml of collagen for 1&#160;h at RT. Before seeding the cells, the gels were incubated in the cell culture media for a minimum of 30&#160;min at 37&#176;C. The non&#8208;transfected, mCherry&#8208;Ctrl&#8208;transfected or mCherry&#8208;SHARPIN&#8208;transfected cells were plated at least 12&#160;h before imaging to allow for proper spreading. For time&#8208;lapse imaging, Roper/Nikon wide confocal spinning disc microscope and for single&#8208;point imaging a Zeiss LSM780 microscope was used. In both cases, a fluorescence image of beads and a phase contrast image of the cells were recorded, cells were detached by adding 10% Triton (Euromedex) or 10&#215; trypsin, and a reference image without cells was recorded. To ensure good quality imaging of fluorescent beads, Z stacks of 15&#8211;30 images with a distance of 1&#160;&#956;m were performed and the best focus chosen (MetaMorph and ImageJ softwares). For data analysis, a previously described correlation algorithm was used to extract the bead displacement fields (Betz et&#160;al, 2011). Traction forces were determined using the Fourier transform traction force algorithm as introduced by Butler et&#160;al (2002). To quantify the contractile potential per cell, the strain energy was measured, which corresponds to the mechanical energy the cells expend to deform the substrate, and is as such a measure for the absolute tensile force generation per cell.</text>

      <text>All AFM indentations were performed using a JPK NanoWizard II AFM with its CellHesion module (JPK Instruments), mounted on a Carl Zeiss confocal microscope Zeiss LSM510 (Carl Zeiss AG). Triangular silicon nitride cantilevers with a spring constant of 0.06&#160;Nm&#8722;1 were custom fitted with borosilicate glass spheres 5&#160;&#956;m in diameter (Novascan Tech) and calibrated using the thermal noise method prior to each experiment (Hutter &amp; Bechhoefer, 1993). The deflection sensitivity was determined in fluid using glass substrates as an infinitely stiff reference material. Tissue was indented in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and at 37&#176;C. A calibrated force of 5&#160;nN was applied, and the Hertz model of impact (Hertz, 1881) was used to determine the elastic properties of the tissue. The Young's elastic modulus was calculated using the JPK data processing software (JPK DP version 4.2) and an input Poisson's ratio of 0.5. Indentation was performed in tissue coming from three independent mice per condition and using 3&#8211;6 sections of 20&#8208;&#956;m thickness per mouse. For each slice, a total of 192 indentation curves distributed in three regions were performed with an 8&#160;&#215;&#160;8 point grid (100&#160;&#215;&#160;100&#160;&#956;m2) in each region. A total of 21 mammary gland slices coming from six mice were analysed. All individual stiffness values for a sample were summarised in Igor Pro 8.37 (WaveMetrics) to obtain the distribution of stiffness values. The bin width was set to 25&#160;Pa, and counts were normalised to the total amount of measured stiffness value per sample. For data fitting, peaks were located and fitted with the Multi&#8208;Peak Fit analysis option of Igor Pro. The statistical difference in mean values was assessed with the paired Student's t&#8208;test in R: Language and Environment for Statistical Computing (R&#160;Core Team).</text>

      <text>Cell&#8208;derived matrices were prepared as described in Cukierman et&#160;al (2001). Shortly, coverslips were coated with 0.2% gelatin (Sigma G1393 in PBS) for 60&#160;min at 37&#176;C. Gelatin cross&#8208;linking was done with 1% glutaraldehyde for 30&#160;min at room temperature followed by 20&#160;min incubation with 1&#160;M glycine at RT. 5&#160;&#215;&#160;104 wild&#8208;type or Sharpincpdm low&#8208;passage mammary gland fibroblasts were seeded on the gelatin&#8208;coated coverslips. To promote collagen synthesis, ascorbic acid treatment (50&#160;&#956;g/ml) was started when the cell layer was fully confluent. Ascorbic acid&#8208;containing medium was changed every day over 10&#160;days. Cells were extracted using extraction buffer (0.5% Triton X and 20&#160;mM NH4OH in PBS), and the remaining DNA was cleared by 10&#160;&#956;M DNAse (11284932001, Roche) treatment for 1&#160;h at 37&#176;C, to produce the acellular CDM preparates.</text>

      <text>Cell&#8208;derived matrices were fixed with 4% PFA for 10&#160;min at RT followed by blocking with 30% horse serum (HRS, 16050&#8208;122, Gibco) in PBS for 10&#160;min at RT. Collagen I antibody (NB600&#8208;408, Novus) was diluted in 30% HRS (1:100 dilution) and incubated for 1&#160;h at RT. CDMs were wash three times with PBS and incubated with secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 568 or 488 Goat Anti&#8208;Rabbit IgG) for 1&#160;h at RT followed by PBS washes and Mowiol mounting. Randomly chosen sample areas were imaged with Zeiss Axiovert 200M with Yokogawa CSU22 spinning disc confocal microscope unit with Hamamatsu Orca ER CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.), 3i CSU&#8208;W1 spinning disc confocal microscope (Intelligent Imaging Innovations) with Hamamatsu CMOS Orca Flash 4 or with Carl Zeiss LSM780 laser scanning confocal microscope using 40&#215;/1.2&#160;W objective. Maximum intensity projection images were evaluated for presence of collagen bundles, and all results were normalised to wt samples.</text>

      <text>Transient transfections with GFP&#8208;paxillin were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer's instructions, and cells were plated overnight on collagen&#8208;coated (20&#160;&#956;g/ml) 35&#8208;mm glass&#8208;bottom dishes (Mattek). GFP&#8208;paxillin dynamics were recorded on a TIRF microscope (Zeiss Laser&#8208;TIRF 3 Imaging System, Carl Zeiss) using a 63&#215; (NA 1.46 Oil, alpha Plan&#8208;Apochromat, DIC) objective and an extra 1.6&#215; magnification was provided by an internal Optovar. Cells were imaged every 1&#160;min, at 37&#176;C in presence of 5% CO2, using multiposition capabilities. Images were recorded using an EMCCD camera (Hamamatsu ImageEM C9100&#8208;13; chip size 512&#160;&#215;&#160;512; Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Hamamatsu City, Japan) controlled by the Zen software (Zen 2012 Blue Edition Systems; Carl Zeiss). After acquisition, videos were opened and processed in ImageJ. In particular, contrast was adjusted, and images smoothened and aligned using the rigid body algorithm. Focal adhesion (FA) dynamics were then analysed using the Focal Adhesion Analysis Server (Berginski &amp; Gomez, 2013). Only FA with lifetime minimum of 10 frames was analysed, and FA that was assembled and disassembled during the course of imaging was used for measurement of FA kinetics.</text>

      <text>MSFs were plated on a 24&#8208;well plate and grown to confluency. Culture medium was replaced by serum&#8208;free medium, and the conditioned medium was collected from parallel samples after 2, 5 and 7&#160;days in culture. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was stored at &#8722;20&#176;C until analysis. Immediately after medium collection, the relative cell number in each well was quantified with Cell Proliferation Reagent WST&#8208;1 (Roche). Briefly, the tetrazolium salt WST&#8208;1 was diluted 1:10 in serum&#8208;free medium and 200&#160;&#956;l was added per well. After 10&#160;min, 100&#160;&#956;l of the WST&#8208;1 medium was collected from each well to 96&#8208;well plate and analysed for absorbance at 450&#160;nm with Multiscan Ascent plate reader (Thermo Scientific).</text>

      <text>Soluble collagen was quantified by precipitation with Sirius red (Direct Red 80, 365548, Sigma) in acidic solution using protocol adapted from Marotta and Martino (1985) and Tullberg&#8208;Reinert and Jundt (1999). One millilitre of 50&#160;&#956;M Sirius red in 0.1&#160;M acetic acid was added to each triplicate medium sample (100&#160;&#956;l) or collagen standard sample (0&#8211;12&#160;&#956;g/ml collagen type I, rat tail, Millipore). Samples were incubated at room temperature for 30&#160;min with mixing every 5&#160;min by inverting the tubes. The precipitated soluble collagen was pelleted by centrifugation (16,000&#160;g 10&#160;min), and pellets were washed ones with acetic acid. The drained collagen pellets were resuspended in 0.1&#160;M KOH (250&#160;&#956;l) by vortexing, and the absorbance of the solution was analysed on a 96&#8208;well plate at 570&#160;nm with Multiscan Ascent plate reader. Soluble collagen concentration in each sample was determined using the standard curve and normalised to the cell amount. Data were further normalised to the soluble collagen content of the wt samples.</text>

      <text>Freshly isolated adherent mammary gland stromal cells (without passaging) were cultured until confluency, and the cells were lysed in RNA extraction lysis buffer. RNA was isolated and DNase&#8208;treated using NucleoSpin&#174; RNA kit 740955.10 (Macherey&#8208;Nagel). RNA quality was controlled with Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent). RNA sequencing libraries were performed using TruSeq RNA Library Preparation Kit v2 (Illumina) and sequenced with HiSeq2500 (Illumina) using TruSeq v3 sequencing chemistry. Single&#8208;read sequencing with 1&#160;&#215;&#160;50&#160;bp read length was used, followed by 6&#160;bp index run. Twelve samples were run on one lane. Technical quality of the sequencing run was good, and the cluster amount was as expected. Greater than 80% of all bases were above Q30. The base&#160;calling was performed using standard bcl2fastq software (Illumina).</text>

      <text>The raw sequencing reads were aligned with Tophat (v. 2.0.1) to mm10 reference genome derived from UCSC database and downloaded from Illumina's iGenomes website (https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html). Genewise read counting was carried out using HTSeq (v 0.5.4p3) based on RefSeq gene annotations. Downstream data analysis was done with R (v. 3.1) and Bioconductor (v. 2.14). Raw count values were normalised using TMM method of the edgeR package. The normalised expression values were also summarised to the reads per kilobase of exon per million reads mapped (RPKM) although these values were not used for statistical testing. Statistical testing was carried out applying voom transformation and limma package taking the pairing of the samples into account, and the differentially expressed genes were filtered in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software with (P&#8208;value &lt;&#160;0.05 and fold&#8208;change &gt;&#160;1.5). A heat map was generated for the differentially expressed genes with RNA expression above 0.2 in the most significantly altered canonical&#160;pathways by GENE&#8208;E matrix visualisation and analysis platform&#160;(http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/GENE-E/index.html).</text>

      <text>Sample size for the studies was chosen according to previous studies in the same area of research. A minimum of three mice was analysed for each genotype for comparison, except for Fig&#160;EV4B and F, where samples from one mouse for each genotype were analysed. Mice with less than three imaged TEBs were excluded from SHG image analysis. The exclusion criterion was pre&#8208;established. No randomisation procedure was used for animal studies. Blinding was used for visual analysis of SHG images (Fig&#160;4B) and RNAscope in&#160;situ hybridisation samples (Fig&#160;EV4B). GraphPad program was used for all statistical analyses. Student's t&#8208;test (unpaired, two&#8208;tailed) was used when normality could be confirmed by D'Agostino &amp; Pearson omnibus normality test. Nonparametric Mann&#8211;Whitney U&#8208;test was used when two non&#8208;normally distributed groups were compared or when normality could not be tested [due to a too small data set (n&#160;&lt;&#160;8)]. Wilcoxon matched&#8208;pairs signed rank test was used if samples with unequal variance were compared. Data are presented in column graphs with mean&#160;&#177;&#160;standard error of mean (SEM) and P&#8208;values. Individual data points per condition are&#160;shown when n&#160;&#8804;&#160;15, and n&#8208;numbers are indicated in figure legends.</text>
