      <text>Reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells rewrites the code of cell fate at the chromatin level. Yet, little is known about this process physically. Here, we describe a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching method to assess the dynamics of heterochromatin/euchromatin and show significant heterochromatin loosening at the initial stage of reprogramming. We identify growth arrest and DNA damage&#8208;inducible protein a (Gadd45a) as a chromatin relaxer in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which also enhances somatic cell reprogramming efficiency. We show that residue glycine 39 (G39) in Gadd45a is essential for interacting with core histones, opening chromatin and enhancing reprogramming. We further demonstrate that Gadd45a destabilizes histone&#8211;DNA interactions and facilitates the binding of Yamanaka factors to their targets for activation. Our study provides a method to screen factors that impact on chromatin structure in live cells, and identifies Gadd45a as a chromatin relaxer.</text>

      <text>Reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by defined factors opened up many interesting avenues for biology and medicine. For example, it is feasible to generate patient&#8208;specific iPSCs that can be used to model diseases for drug developments or generate functional cells to treat illness through cell transplantation 1, 2. Yet, recent reports have suggested that iPSCs generated with current technologies may have potential problems in clinical applications due to genome integration and immunogenicity 3, 4. Thus, further refinement and improvement of current reprogramming methods may mitigate some of those concerns.</text>

      <text>Reprogramming is an epigenetic process. For example, DNA demethylation enzymes such as the Tet family have been shown to play a critical role in the reestablishment of pluripotency 5, 6, 7. Likewise, histone modification enzymes or small molecule inhibitors/activators for these enzymes have been shown to regulate reprogramming efficiency 8, 9, 10, 11. At the chromatin level, remodeling factors such as Brg1 and Baf155 have been shown to promote reprogramming 12, whereas other modifying enzymes such as Dot1l or Mbd3 have been shown to inhibit reprogramming 13, 14. These insights not only enhanced our understanding of reprogramming, but also provided means to improve the reprogramming process. At the cellular level, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) appear to undergo a mesenchymal&#8208;to&#8208;epithelial transition (MET) at the early phase of reprogramming 15, 16. Beyond the MET, there is an intermediate state called pre&#8208;iPSCs 17, 18, which can be further converted to fully reprogrammed iPSCs by vitamin C (Vc) apparently through histone demethylases specific for H3K9me3 19. Therefore, factors capable of modulating the epigenetic state may be beneficial to reprogramming.</text>

      <text>iPSCs, like ESCs, have less condensed heterochromatin foci and hyperdynamic chromatin proteins compared to MEFs 20, 21. Therefore, reprogramming of MEFs into iPSCs must undergo a gradual loosening or relaxation of the tightly packed heterochromatin in MEFs. It has been reported that fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) can be used to analyze the dynamic interaction among chromatin proteins 22, 23. Here in this report, we describe a FRAP&#8208;based method to analyze heterochromatin and euchromatin dynamics during reprogramming and the identification of Gadd45a as a powerful chromatin relaxer that also enhances reprogramming robustly.</text>

      <text>Heterochromatin has been shown to be the main difference between somatic and pluripotent stem cells and also one of the major barriers for reprogramming 24, 25, 26. To understand the dynamic changes in heterochromatin during reprogramming, we took advantage of a previously reported live cell imaging method to detect chromatin dynamics called FRAP 22, 23 and made several critical modifications such that we can monitor and quantify euchromatin and heterochromatin remodeling dynamics. First, we labeled heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a) with mCherry and chromatin&#8208;associated protein Histone1 (H1) with green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Fig 1A). HP1a&#8208;mCherry should allow us to distinguish between heterochromatin and euchromatin by selecting the region of interest (ROI) within (heterochromatin) or outside (euchromatin) HP1a foci; meanwhile, H1&#8208;GFP has been widely used in FRAP analysis of chromatin 27. We also developed FRAP of H1&#8208;GFP in these ROIs to analyze the dynamics of heterochromatic and euchromatic H1, respectively (Fig 1A). We recorded FRAP curves for a period of 120 s after bleaching and analyzed the mobile fraction (MF), which refers to the recovery ratio in 120 s post&#8208;bleaching. This method allows a concise determination of heterochromatin and euchromatin dynamics by sequential HP1a region selection and H1 FRAP.</text>

      <text>We then performed FRAP analysis and found that only heterochromatin, not euchromatin, exhibits greater MFs in cells undergoing reprogramming (SKO&#8208;D3) than in control MEFs (Flag&#8208;D3) (Fig 1B and C), suggesting that heterochromatin undergoes a relaxation process at the early phase of reprogramming. We then quantified heterochromatin with HP1a stain and showed that it overlaps with 4&#8242;, 6&#8208;diamidino&#8208;2&#8208;phenylindole (DAPI) staining (Fig EV1A and B). Interestingly, in MEFs undergoing SKO or Sox2, Klf4, Oct4, c&#8208;Myc (SKOM) reprogramming, we observed a dramatic decrease in heterochromatin at the very early phase of reprogramming (day 3) (Fig EV1A&#8211;D), a known feature characteristic of pluripotent stem cells 28, 29. We also performed immunofluorescence in situ hybridization (immuno&#8208;FISH) to map the endogenous Oct4 locus and HP1a foci in MEFs infected with SKO or SKOM. While the Oct4 loci overlapped with HP1a foci in control MEFs, no such association was found between them in MEFs undergoing SKO or SKOM reprogramming (Figs 1D and E, and EV1E and F). Taken together, our results demonstrate that heterochromatin undergoes significant relaxation during early stages of reprogramming.</text>

      <text>As heterochromatin relaxes during the conversion of somatic cells into iPSCs, we wish to employ FRAP to screen for factors that can relax heterochromatin and perhaps enhance reprogramming also. We firstly tested six chemicals or protein factors with FRAP in MEFs: valproic acid (VPA) as positive control 27, protein factors (p53, p21 and Gadd45a) in cell cycle regulation 30, 31, 32, and Jumonji family proteins (Jhdm1b and Utx) with the ability to enhance reprogramming 9, 10, 33 (Fig EV2A). VPA is a histone deacetylase inhibitor known to enhance heterochromatin dynamics and somatic cell reprogramming 27, 34, and thus serves as a positive control. Interestingly, we discovered that Gadd45a also increases heterochromatin dynamics (Figs 2A and EV2A). In contrast, p53 and p21, which have been reported to inhibit reprogramming 35, 36, 37, suppress heterochromatin dynamics (Fig EV2A and B). On the other hand, Jhdm1b and Utx, which have been reported to facilitate reprogramming 9, 10, 33, surprisingly, have no effect on heterochromatin dynamics (Fig EV2A and B).</text>

      <text>We then showed that the H1 dynamics in MEFs gradually decreases during culture from day 3 to day 10 perhaps due to cell senescence and can be reversed by Gadd45a (Fig EV2C and D). It appears that both heterochromatin and euchromatin are affected by Gadd45a under the same experimental settings (Fig EV2E). To further understand the role of Gadd45a on chromatin density status, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays with antibodies targeting H3K9Ac, H3K9me2, H3K9me3, H3K27Ac, H3K27me2, and H3K27me3 at the promoters of the pluripotency genes Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 in MEFs infected with Gadd45a. Overexpression of Gadd45a could increase the H3K9Ac and H3K27Ac levels and reduce the H3K9Me2/3 and H3K27Me2/3 levels (Appendix Fig S1). Methylation of H3K9 and H3K27 is thought to be a marker for heterochromatin 24, and H3K27 methylation could be established by dense chromatin 38. Histone acetylation is always associated with active gene promoters and transcription 39. Taken together, our results suggest that Gadd45a regulates chromatin density and can relax it significantly.</text>

      <text>Based on the ability of Gadd45a to relax both heterochromatin and euchromatin in MEFs (Figs 2A and EV2A and E), we next tested whether Gadd45a could further relax chromatin during reprogramming. We co&#8208;infected MEF cells with Gadd45a and the reprogramming factors SKO, and found that Gadd45a increases heterochromatin H1 dynamics by FRAP, though it has no further effect on euchromatin dynamics (Figs 2B and EV2F). ChIP assays with antibodies targeting H3K9Ac, H3K9me2, H3K9me3, H3K27Ac, H3K27me2, and H3K27me3 during reprogramming with SKO or SKO plus Gadd45a on day 3 of reprogramming were performed to show an enhancement of the H3K9Ac and H3K27Ac levels and a reduction of the H3K9me2, H3K9me3, H3K27me2, and H3K27me3 levels at the promoters of the pluripotency genes Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 in the presence of Gadd45a (Fig 2C). These results suggest that Gadd45a dynamically regulates modifications of H3K9 and H3K27, that is, acetylation enhancement and methylation reduction, during reprogramming. Based on these observations, we further conclude that Gadd45a relaxes heterochromatin in reprogramming cells.</text>

      <text>We next ask whether Gadd45a enhances reprogramming. To this end, we co&#8208;infected MEFs containing a transgenic Oct4 promoter driving GFP expression (OG2 MEFs), with Gadd45a and the reprogramming factor combinations SKO/SKOM. The GFP&#8208;positive colonies were counted in SKO or SKOM reprogramming, respectively. The normalized relative reprogramming efficiency was calculated as reported 40 and shown in Fig 3A. We found that Gadd45a can improve the efficiency of reprogramming (Fig 3A). The resulting iPSC clones were characterized for the expression of several pluripotent markers (Appendix Fig S2A&#8211;E), and for their abilities to generate chimeric mice capable of germline transmission (Appendix Fig S2F).</text>

      <text>The Gadd45 family comprises three members, Gadd45a, Gadd45b and Gadd45g, which have several conserved domains and similar functions 41, 42. Although the expression level of these three genes in reprogramming cells was similar to that in control MEFs (Appendix Fig S3A), all of them could greatly promote reprogramming (Fig 3A), but had no additive effects, indicating that they function in the same way (Fig 3B). We further showed that Gadd45a could not substitute Sox2, Klf4, or Oct4 among the reprogramming factors in generating iPSCs (Appendix Fig S3B).</text>

      <text>To test whether endogenous Gadd45 proteins are required for reprogramming, we knocked down the three Gadd45 proteins using shRNAs (Fig EV3A). The reprogramming efficiencies, H1 dynamics, and pluripotency gene expression were not affected by neither individual nor combined knockdown them (Fig EV3B&#8211;D), suggesting paradoxically that either Gadd45 proteins are not the endogenous factors mediating heterochromatin relaxation or any residual Gadd45a might be sufficient during reprogramming.</text>

      <text>We then investigated the time window of sensitivity to Gadd45a with a doxycycline (DOX)&#8208;inducible system and showed that Gadd45a is effective in the early and middle stages of reprogramming. Specifically, we showed that in SKO&#8208;mediated reprogramming, Gadd45a is effective between days 2 and 14, whereas in SKOM&#8208;mediated reprogramming, between days 2 and 8. When DOX was added at different time points, we found that Gadd45a does not have any effect on both SKO&#8208; or SKOM&#8208;mediated reprogramming after day 11 (Fig 3C). These results suggest that Gadd45a functions in a time&#8208;dependent manner to promote reprogramming at the early and middle stages when heterochromatin remodeling occurs.</text>

      <text>The Gadd45 proteins are stress inducible and involved in multiple biological processes, such as cell cycle, senescence, tumor progression, DNA repair and active DNA demethylation 43, 44, 45. To better understand the roles of Gadd45a in heterochromatin relaxation, we constructed and tested a series of point mutants of Gadd45a in somatic cell reprogramming. According to previous reports, residues G39 and K45 are conserved among three Gadd45 proteins and are critical for Gadd45 proteins to bind RNAs 46. We designed substitutions for G39 with alanine, K45 with glutamate, and also a non&#8208;conservative residue R34 with glycine (Fig EV4A), which has no effects on structure 47. We then showed that the R34G and K45E mutants had no effect on the functions of Gadd45a in both heterochromatin and euchromatin dynamics, as well as reprogramming (Fig 4A, B and E, and Appendix Fig S4A). However, the G39A mutant lost the ability to relax heterochromatin and euchromatin according to FRAP (Fig 4A and B, and Appendix Fig S4A). We further showed that G39A Gadd45a is no longer able to reduce the HP1a foci as effectively as wild&#8208;type Gadd45a (Fig 4C), consistent with the FRAP results. To further confirm the FRAP result, we performed immuno&#8208;FISH to map the endogenous Oct4 loci and HP1a foci in MEFs infected with wild&#8208;type or G39A Gadd45a. We observed that there was no association between the Oct4 loci and HP1a foci in MEFs infected with wild&#8208;type Gadd45a. However, the Oct4 loci remained co&#8208;localized with HP1a in MEFs infected with G39A Gadd45a, as in controls (Figs 4D and EV4B). Together, we conclude that G39 is required for Gadd45a to relax chromatin.</text>

The increase of H3K9Ac and H3K27Ac and the reduction of H3K9Me2/3 and H3K27Me2/3 by wild&#8208;type Gadd45a were also impaired by G39A mutation (Fig EV4C).

      <text>To explore the role of Gadd45a and its G39 residue in histone&#8211;DNA interaction, we purified recombinant wild&#8208;type Gadd45a and G39A Gadd45a proteins (Fig EV5A and B) and performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with several probes amplified from the Oct4 promoter (Appendix Fig S5A). As expected, the addition of core histones alone retarded the oligomer mobility (Fig 5A). Gadd45a did not change the mobility of the probes in the absence of core histones, indicating that Gadd45a does not interact directly with DNA (Fig 5A). In the presence of core histones, Gadd45a increased the mobility of DNA and counteracted the effect of histones (Fig 5A and Appendix Fig S5B&#8211;D), consistent with the observed interruption of the core histones and double&#8208;stranded DNA by Gadd45 48. On the other hand, G39A Gadd45a was inactive in the same assay system (Fig 5A and Appendix Fig S5B&#8211;D). We also tested a half&#8208;length probe compared with the previous probes and obtained similar results (Appendix Fig S5E). As both the CMV promoter and the EGFP gene showed the same results, Gadd45a appears to regulate the interactions between DNA and histones in a DNA sequence&#8208;independent manner (Appendix Fig S5F and G). Since core histones prepared by high&#8208;salt extraction may contain unknown nuclear components, we decided to repeat the same experiments with purified recombinant histones. To determine which protein Gadd45a acts on, we simply used the H2A/H2B heterodimer and the H3/H4 tetramer to perform EMSA (Fig 5B). We showed that the wild&#8208;type Gadd45a, but not the G39A mutant, blocked the mobility shift of the DNA in the presence of either the H2A/H2B heterodimer or the H3/H4 tetramer (Fig 5B).</text>

We showed that MEFs infected with SKO factors display an open structure in all the studied regions compared with MEFs infected with the Flag control (Fig 5E and Appendix Fig S6). We then showed that Gadd45a, but not its inactive G39A mutant, further increases the nuclease access (Fig 5E and Appendix Fig S6).</text>

      <text>We then wished to test whether Gadd45a facilitates the binding of the Yamanaka factors Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 to their targets during reprogramming. By performing ChIP&#8208;PCR to assess the factor binding properties, we showed that on day 8 all three factors bound to their targets more readily when co&#8208;expressed with wild&#8208;type Gadd45a, but not G39A Gadd45a (Fig 5F). Consistently, a recent study has shown that chromatin opening by chromatin relaxers such as CAF&#8208;1 could promote binding of reprogramming factors to their targets 25. Together, our data demonstrate that Gadd45a, via G39, disrupts histone&#8211;DNA interactions, opens heterochromatin, and enhances the binding of reprogramming factors to their targets.</text>

      <text>To investigate the genes regulated by Gadd45a through chromatin relaxation during reprogramming, we analyzed the gene expressions in MEF cells undergoing reprogramming transfected with wild&#8208;type Gadd45a or G39A. Microarray assays were performed twice and the common data showed that Gadd45a promotes the expression of 335 genes involved in embryo development (such as NF2 and Sprr1a), germ cell development (such as Rnf17 and Ddx25), amino acid modification (such as Metap2 and Map6d1), among many (Fig 6A and Appendix Fig S7A and B). On the other hand, Gadd45a also appears to inhibit the expression of 96 genes involved in neurotransmitter transport (such as Gad2 and Trim9) and several metabolic processes (such as Stat5b and Cytl1) (Appendix Fig S7A and B, and S8A). We also showed that pluripotency maintenance genes are upregulated by Gadd45a during reprogramming (Fig 6B). We then confirmed the expression of these pluripotency genes by qPCR and showed that whereas wild&#8208;type Gadd45a enhances the expression of pluripotency genes such as endogenous Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 during reprogramming, G39A Gadd45a does not (Fig 6C and Appendix Fig S8B). The higher pluripotency gene expression could be the cause or the consequence of improved reprogramming. Of note, Jhdm1b, a factor that could greatly enhance reprogramming efficiency 9, does not promote the expression of pluripotency genes under similar settings (Appendix Fig S8C).</text>

      <text>In this report, we present a live cell imaging method, FRAP, to measure the dynamics of heterochromatin/euchromatin in cells undergoing reprogramming and demonstrated significant heterochromatin relaxation at the initial stage of reprogramming. Furthermore, by using the adapted FRAP as a screening tool, we identified Gadd45a as an unexpected heterochromatin relaxer as well as reprogramming enhancer. Similarly, it has been reported that the histone chaperone CAF&#8208;1 promotes reprogramming as well as increases chromatin dynamics 25. The chromatin remodelers, such as Brg1/BAF155 12, INO80 50, have been also reported to be able to promote reprogramming. Thus, heterochromatin dynamics may serve as a critical process in regulating the initiating phase of somatic cell reprogramming.</text>

      <text>Chromatin structure and dynamics can be analyzed by a number of methods, including electron microscopy 51 and ChIP&#8208;seq 52, 53. However, neither can be performed on live cells. In this study, we developed the live cell imaging method, FRAP, for concisely measuring the dynamics of heterochromatin/euchromatin, which can also be adapted as a screening tool for heterochromatin relaxer. By this method, we tested several factors including p53 and p21 whose overexpression leads to reduction in chromatin dynamics (Fig EV2A and B). Indeed, p53 activation and p21 activation have been reported to modulate cellular senescence, one important function of which is densely stained regions of chromatin 30, 31, 32. FRAP is therefore able to identify not only enhancers but also barriers of reprogramming.</text>

      <text>Our finding that Gadd45a is a heterochromatin relaxer capable of enhancing reprogramming may generate further interests mechanistically. As Gadd45a has been reported previously to play important roles in regulating cell cycle, senescence, apoptosis, DNA damage repair, DNA demethylation, and tumorigenesis 43, 54, 55, one may be intrigued if these reported functions are responsible for the observed impact of Gadd45a on reprogramming. However, we actually showed that Gadd45a inhibits MEF proliferation during reprogramming (Appendix Fig S9), suggesting that it enhances reprogramming not through accelerating cell proliferation. On the other hand, the relationship between Gadd45 proteins and p53 is inconsistent as cells activate Gadd45a through p53 under ionic irradiation 43, 48, yet p53 is a potent inhibitor of reprogramming 35, 36, 37 and all Gadd45 proteins have the same effects on reprogramming (Fig 3A). Therefore, it appears that Gadd45a promotes and p53 inhibits reprogramming through different mechanisms.</text>

      <text>We did not demonstrate that endogenous Gadd45 proteins are required for reprogramming. We used shRNAs to knockdown Gadd45 proteins and showed that the knockdown has no effect on reprogramming. This could be due to the residual Gadd45 proteins after shRNA&#8208;mediated knockdown being sufficient for reprogramming. As such, only genetic ablation of all three Gadd45 proteins may allow us to address this question in the near future. Nonetheless, our work shows that Gadd45, when overexpressed as an exogenous factor, disrupts histone&#8211;DNA interactions, opens up chromatin, and facilitates the binding of the Yamanaka factors to their targets. Gadd45a could be opening chromatin directly by disrupting histone&#8211;DNA interactions. There could also be alternative mechanism such as DNA methylation. Indeed, we have analyzed the total DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation levels at the early stage of reprogramming in the presence and absence of Gadd45a. Neither DNA methylation nor hydroxymethylation was affected by Gadd45a (Appendix Fig S10A and B). We also tested for the DNA methylation of the Oct4 and Nanog promoter regions and found no obvious differences among GFP, SKO, and SKO plus Gadd45a at day 8 (Appendix Fig S10D). Besides, we tried to overexpress XPB and XPG, which were reported to be the DNA repair endonucleases required for Gadd45a to demethylate DNA 55, 56, as well as TAF12, that could recruit Gadd45a and the nucleotide excision repair proteins (such as XPG) to demethylate the promoter of rRNA genes 45, and showed that these proteins are unable to enhance reprogramming (Appendix Fig S10C). Further studies would be needed to clarify the mechanism.</text>

      <text>Interestingly, G39 has been reported to be a critical amino acid for the function and localization of Gadd45a 46. Exchange of glycine residue at this position for alanine would lead to considerable steric clashes such as RNA binding defect. However, K45E Gadd45a still enhances reprogramming despite its inability to bind RNAs, indicating that the two properties of Gadd45a can be uncoupled. By analyzing the crystal structure of Gadd45a in silico, dimerization of Gadd45a does not seem to be affected by G39A 47. This raises the possibility that G39A interferes with some other important property of Gadd45a, for example, interaction with core histones to loosen heterochromatin in our experiments.</text>

      <text>Finally, heterochromatin dynamics could be a universal process in cell fate transitions. Factors identified by FRAP screening might affect not only somatic cell reprogramming, but also other cell fate transitions. To this end, we have shown that Gadd45a could relax heterochromatin in human fibroblasts (Appendix Fig S11). We believe that further exploration of factors that can impact heterochromatin dynamics with FRAP as shown here can lead to better practice and understanding of cell fate reprogramming.</text>
