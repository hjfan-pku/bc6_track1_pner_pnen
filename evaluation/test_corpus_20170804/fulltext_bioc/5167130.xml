      <text>Genetic causes of many familial arrhythmia syndromes remain elusive. In this study, whole&#8208;exome sequencing (WES) was carried out on patients from three different families that presented with life&#8208;threatening arrhythmias and high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Two French Canadian probands carried identical homozygous rare variant in TECRL gene (p.Arg196Gln), which encodes the trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;enoyl&#8208;CoA reductase&#8208;like protein. Both patients had cardiac arrest, stress&#8208;induced atrial and ventricular tachycardia, and QT prolongation on adrenergic stimulation. A third patient from a consanguineous Sudanese family diagnosed with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) had a homozygous splice site mutation (c.331+1G&gt;A) in TECRL. Analysis of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) dynamics in human induced pluripotent stem cell&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC&#8208;CMs) generated from this individual (TECRLH om&#8208;hiPSCs), his heterozygous but clinically asymptomatic father (TECRLH et&#8208;hiPSCs), and a healthy individual (CTRL&#8208;hiPSCs) from the same Sudanese family, revealed smaller [Ca2+]i transient amplitudes as well as elevated diastolic [Ca2+]i in TECRLH om&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs compared with CTRL&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs. The [Ca2+]i transient also rose markedly slower and contained lower sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium stores, evidenced by the decreased magnitude of caffeine&#8208;induced [Ca2+]i transients. In addition, the decay phase of the [Ca2+]i transient was slower in TECRLH om&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs due to decreased SERCA and NCX activities. Furthermore, TECRLH om&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs showed prolonged action potentials (APs) compared with CTRL&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs. TECRL knockdown in control human embryonic stem cell&#8208;derived CMs (hESC&#8208;CMs) also resulted in significantly longer APs. Moreover, stimulation by noradrenaline (NA) significantly increased the propensity for triggered activity based on delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) in TECRLH om&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs and treatment with flecainide, a class Ic antiarrhythmic drug, significantly reduced the triggered activity in these cells. In summary, we report that mutations in TECRL are associated with inherited arrhythmias characterized by clinical features of both LQTS and CPVT. Patient&#8208;specific hiPSC&#8208;CMs recapitulated salient features of the clinical phenotype and provide a platform for drug screening evidenced by initial identification of flecainide as a potential therapeutic. These findings have implications for diagnosis and treatment of inherited cardiac arrhythmias.</text>

      <text>Inherited arrhythmogenic diseases (IADs) are one of the prevalent causes of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the young (Wilde &amp; Behr, 2013). IADs can be classified into disorders with or without structural heart defects. The latter include channelopathies such as long QT syndrome (LQTS) and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), caused by mutations in genes encoding ion channel or calcium&#8208;handling proteins that primarily affect the electrical activity of the heart (Schwartz et&#160;al, 2013; Wilde &amp; Behr, 2013).</text>

      <text>LQTS is most commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant mode, where mutations in KCNH2, KCNQ1, and SCN5A account for the majority of cases (Wilde &amp; Behr, 2013). A very rare autosomal recessive form of LQTS, often accompanied with sensorineural deafness (Jervell&#8211;Lange&#8208;Nielsen syndrome), has been linked to mutations in KCNQ1 and KCNE1. At least 12 other genes have been linked to LQTS. However, 20&#8211;30% of LQTS cases remain genetically elusive. The mechanism of arrhythmia in LQTS mainly involves QT prolongation with early afterdepolarization&#8208;mediated triggered activity, which&#160;can lead to torsades de pointes (TdP) and ventricular fibrillation.</text>

      <text>CPVT is also commonly inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder due to mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor, RYR2 (65% of all cases). Rare autosomal recessive mutations in the calcium&#8208;sequestering protein, CASQ2 (2&#8211;5% of all cases), account for a small fraction of CPVT population (Lahat et&#160;al, 2001; Laitinen et&#160;al, 2001; Priori et&#160;al, 2001; Postma et&#160;al, 2002). Mutations in TRDN (Roux&#8208;Buisson et&#160;al, 2012), a calcium release complex protein, and CALM1 (Nyegaard et&#160;al, 2012), a calcium&#8208;binding protein, have also been implicated in CPVT. Interestingly, CALM1, CALM2, and CALM3 mutations have also been linked to early&#8208;onset LQTS (Crotti et&#160;al, 2013; Reed et&#160;al, 2015; Chaix et&#160;al, 2016), highlighting the locus&#8208;disease heterogeneity in IADs. Clinically, a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) at rest and typical arrhythmias, including bi&#8208;directional and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), in response to catecholaminergic stress is&#160;observed in CPVT. Susceptibility to VT in response to &#946;&#8208;adrenergic stimulation is the hallmark of CPVT, which manifests as exercise&#8208;induced syncope and sudden death (Leenhardt et&#160;al, 2012).</text>

      <text>Although understanding of genetic loci associated with IADs has improved remarkably over the last few years, in a number of cases, the genetic basis of the clinical phenotype has remained elusive (Schwartz et&#160;al, 2013). Genetic testing in LQTS and CPVT has been broadly adopted as a screening tool for these potentially fatal diseases. In cases without known disease&#8208;causing mutations, identifying family members at risk of SCD can however be challenging. Therefore, discovering novel Mendelian disease&#8208;causing loci through genetic testing has the potential to improve clinical care and prevent SCD.</text>

      <text>In this study, we identified mutations in trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;enoyl&#8208;CoA reductase&#8208;like (TECRL) gene in three patients with clinical arrhythmias in whom none of the mutations in the most common LQTS and CPVT genes had been detected. Two of these patients were of French Canadian origin but unrelated and were&#160;diagnosed with LQTS at the Cardiovascular Genetics Center of the Montreal Heart Institute (MHI). They had strikingly similar&#160;cardiac electrical phenotypes characterized by normal QT interval on their ECG at baseline, adrenergic&#8208;induced QT prolongation as well as atrial and ventricular arrhythmias including aborted SCD. Whole&#8208;exome sequencing (WES) of these patients revealed the presence of an identical homozygous rare variant in exon 6 of TECRL, also annotated SRD5A2L2 (p.Arg196Gln).</text>

      <text>A third patient included in this study belongs to a consanguineous Arab family of Sudanese origin reported previously (Bhuiyan et&#160;al, 2007). Members of this family were diagnosed with early&#8208;onset and highly malignant form of CPVT and segregation analysis indicated an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Sequencing of the coding exons and exon&#8211;intron boundaries of RYR2 and CASQ2 and several other cardiac genes such as KCNJ2, FKBP12.6, SCN5A, KCNH2, KCNQ1, KCNE1, KCNE2, and NCX1 had not revealed any mutations. Here, we identified a homozygous G&gt;A point mutation in the splice donor site of intron 3 of TECRL (TECRLc.331+1G&gt;A) in the affected individuals of this family. To date, all but two children, who inherited this mutation in the affected family, died following a cardiac event during physical activity. To understand the functional consequence of the TECRLc.331+1G&gt;A mutation and model the disease phenotype in&#160;vitro, we generated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) (Takahashi et&#160;al, 2007) from a 5&#8208;year&#8208;old symptomatic patient (referred to as TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSCs), his heterozygous (but clinically asymptomatic) father (TECRLHet&#8208;hiPSCs), and a family member free of the mutation (CTRL&#8208;hiPSCs). hiPSCs were differentiated into cardiomyocytes (CMs) and analyzed in&#160;vitro. Using the patient&#8208;derived hiPSC&#8208;CMs, we showed that the c.331+1G&gt;A mutation in TECRL leads to skipping of exon 3. TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs recapitulated aspects of the disease phenotype in&#160;vitro including increased susceptibility to triggered activity, which could be alleviated by treatment with flecainide.</text>

      <text>This study reports three patients from three different families presenting clinically with life&#8208;threatening arrhythmias and cardiac arrest followed by successful resuscitation. Two of these patients were diagnosed with LQTS at the Cardiovascular Genetics Center of the Montreal Heart Institute following investigation for aborted cardiac arrest. They had distinctive clinical features of recurrent exercise&#8208; and emotion&#8208;induced atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. The third patient was from a large consanguineous family with two sub&#8208;families and several children affected with adrenergic&#8208;related lethal events and were previously diagnosed with CPVT (Bhuiyan et&#160;al, 2007). Detailed clinical manifestations of these three patients and additional family members are described below and in the Appendix.</text>

      <text>Patient 1 is a French Canadian female, who presented with ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest during walking at age 22, without prior history of syncope or documented arrhythmia. Coronary angiography, transthoracic echocardiography, and invasive electrophysiological (EP) testing, including ventricular premature stimulation, were normal. The resting ECG showed a normal QT interval, but isoproterenol infusion resulted in QT prolongation. During follow&#8208;up, the patient presented with recurrent episodes of exercise&#8208; or emotion&#8208;induced atrial and ventricular arrhythmias resulting in multiple shocks from an implantable cardioverter&#8211;defibrillator (ICD). Arrhythmia was refractory to standard beta&#8208;blockers (metoprolol and bisoprolol) but was finally suppressed by high doses of nadolol. During further follow&#8208;up, repeat echocardiography remained normal but significant repolarization abnormalities with QT prolongation (QTc range: 451&#8211;494&#160;ms) during follow&#8208;up were occasionally seen on the resting ECG (Fig&#160;1A); the patient was therefore diagnosed with LQTS. The parents were not known to be consanguineous but came from the same town. No family member was available for genetic testing.</text>

      <text>Patient 2 is also a French Canadian female. She presented initially at age 18 with numerous syncopal episodes triggered by emotional stress, with documentation of non&#8208;sustained VT during exercise stress testing. Despite beta&#8208;blocker therapy, she had an aborted cardiac arrest during emotional stress at the age of 31. At rest, the QTc was 437&#160;ms with repolarization abnormalities (Fig&#160;1B). Coronary angiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging were unremarkable. Sustained polymorphic VT was inducible with one ventricular extrastimulus during isoproterenol infusion. Epinephrine challenge resulted in a 57&#160;ms paradoxical QT prolongation with appearance of ventricular bigeminy, suggesting a low repolarization reserve compatible with LQTS (Fig&#160;1C). During follow&#8208;up, the patient had multiple episodes of adrenergic atrial and ventricular arrhythmia resulting in numerous ICD shocks. Electrophysiological mapping showed an extensive low&#8208;voltage area along the interatrial septum and multiple foci of atrial tachycardia (AT) was ablated. The combination of AT ablation and nadolol significantly decreased arrhythmia recurrence in this patient.</text>

      <text>Patient 3 (Subject 1V:13 of Fig&#160;1D) is a Sudanese male who presented with cardiac arrest at age 4 while running. ECG recording during successful resuscitation showed ventricular fibrillation and TdP, which was reversed to sinus rhythm following DC shock. ECG showed a QTc interval of 450&#160;ms (Fig&#160;1E). He had a second attack while in hospital but was in sinus rhythm between the two attacks with a normal QRS axis, aQTc interval of 450&#160;ms, and no ST changes. He later received an ICD and has had no further syncope or cardiac arrest. However, ICD interrogation occasionally revealed a fast rhythm around 193&#160;beats/min (cycle length 310&#160;ms) with polymorphic ventricular ectopy (Fig&#160;1F). The parents of patient 3 are first&#8208;degree cousins and seven of 13 children in the family presented exertion&#8208;induced arrhythmias and/or SCD during early childhood. In five of these children, an arrhythmic episode was fatal. Two children (IV:9 and IV:13) survived an arrhythmic attack. Clinical features of the other affected subjects are summarized in Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S1. IV:1, IV:2, IV:4, and IV:10 have been described earlier (Bhuiyan et&#160;al, 2007). Clinical details of IV:8, IV:9, and IV:13 are further detailed in the Appendix.</text>

      <text>In summary, the clinical phenotype of the affected individuals is characterized by: (i) adrenergic VTs with high prevalence of cardiac arrest and SCD, (ii) recurrent AT sometimes triggering ventricular arrhythmias, and (iii) normal or mildly prolonged QTc at baseline with paradoxical QT increase during adrenergic stimulation. Taken together, the patients from all three families presented a similar severe arrhythmia phenotype with overlapping features of both LQTS and CPVT.</text>

      <text>To uncover the underlying genetic cause of arrhythmias in these patients, WES was performed on genomic DNA from patients and family members when available. Given the low prevalence of IADs, the fact that LQTS or CPVT can independently be caused by many different genes, and reasoning that most mutations identified to date are non&#8208;synonymous and familial in nature, we elected to focus our analyses exclusively on novel non&#8208;synonymous variants.</text>

      <text>Patient 1 and patient 2 underwent clinical genetic testing and did not contain mutations in KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, or KCNE2, five genes most frequently implicated in LQTS. Overall, WES identified 57,828 high&#8208;quality single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and in/dels for these two subjects, 231 of which were novel non&#8208;synonymous coding and splice site variants. Given the striking similarity in disease phenotype, patient 1 and patient 2 were screened for variants in the same gene, which resulted in the identification of an identical novel homozygous single base pair (bp) mutation in TECRL, resulting in an arginine to glutamine substitution at position 196 (p.Arg196Gln). We developed a genotyping assay and confirmed independently that the mutation was homozygous in the two patients and absent in 540 European&#8208;derived chromosomes. The p.Arg196Gln substitution is predicted to be &#8220;probably damaging&#8221; by PolyPhen&#8208;2, deleterious by SIFT, and is within a site with a high Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling (GERP) score (5.11).</text>

      <text>The pedigree of the Sudanese family (Fig&#160;1D) was compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance. To reveal the underlying genetic cause of SCD, WES was performed on genomic DNA from two children, IV:2 and IV:10, who are first&#8208;degree cousins (Fig&#160;1D) with clinical symptoms. Genomic DNA from the parents of IV:2 (III:1 and III:2; Fig&#160;1D), who are clinically normal, was also included for WES. On average, this yielded &#8805;&#160;81.5&#160;million reads per sample, 87% of which could be mapped. The mean coverage of the target region was &lt;&#160;103&#8208;fold, with over 93% of target regions covered by &#8805;&#160;10 reads. In total 67,000&#8211;78,000 SNVs and 4,300&#8211;5,400&#160;small in/dels were identified in each of the individuals, of which 1,401&#8211;1,789 were novel non&#8208;synonymous coding and splice site variants.</text>

      <text>We then prioritized variants according to disease inheritance pattern in the index patient, his parents, and affected cousin. This resulted in identification of five SNVs (Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S2), all shared by IV:2 and IV:10 as homozygous and III:1 and III:2 as heterozygous following expected disease inheritance pattern. All these variants were further tested in the family members by Sanger sequencing. Of these, a single bp mutation in ANKRD17 (p.Val1368Gly) and a splice site mutation in TECRL (c.331+1G&gt;A) were found to be homozygous in all children who had presented with a clinical phenotype (IV:2, IV:4, IV:8, IV:9, IV:10, and IV:13; Fig&#160;1D) while the parents (III:1, III:2, III:3, and III:4) were found to be heterozygous in both families. ANKRD17c.4103T&gt;G and TECRLc.331+1G&gt;A variants were not reported as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the general population (neither in dbSNP, 1000 Genomes, 6500 NHLBI, ExAC browser nor in our in&#8208;house CoLaus and Vital&#8208;IT/SIB databases) and indicated a substitution deficit and evolutionary conservation (phastCons&#8208;46 way score of 0.498 and GERP++ score of 5.32 for ANKRD17; phastCons&#8208;46 way score of 0.397 and GERP++ score of 5.23 for TECRL). Additionally, these mutations were not found in any of control DNA samples obtained from 72 Saudi Arabian individuals. Importantly, no ANKRD17 variant was identified in the two French Canadian patients.</text>

      <text>Human TECRL maps to chromosome 4q13 and contains 12 exons (Appendix&#160;Fig S1A). The open reading frame of TECRL encodes a 363 amino acid protein and predicted to contain a ubiquitin&#8208;like domain in the N&#8208;terminal half of the protein, three transmembrane segments as well as a 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;5&#8208;alpha steroid 4&#8208;dehydrogenase domain in the C&#8208;terminal half of the protein (Appendix&#160;Fig S1B and C). The homozygous mutation in TECRL found in patients 1 and 2 (p.Arg196Gln), is located in 6th exon of TECRL, and causes an amino acid substitution immediately upstream of the 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;5&#8208;alphasteroid 4&#8208;dehydrogenase domain (Appendix&#160;Fig S1C). On the other hand, TECRLc.331+1G&gt;A mutation found in patient 3 is located in the splice donor site of intron 3 resulting in an internal deletion in the putative ubiquitin&#8208;like domain (Appendix&#160;Fig S1A&#8211;C). Comparison of amino acid sequences of TECRL revealed a high degree of cross&#8208;species conservation (Appendix&#160;Fig S1D), suggesting that TECRL might have an essential function in the heart.</text>

      <text>Previously, TECRL was identified in a genome&#8208;wide transcriptional profiling study of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) differentiating to CMs in&#160;vitro. Moreover, in the mouse embryo, its expression was restricted to the heart and inflow tract (Beqqali et&#160;al, 2006). To further define the spatiotemporal expression pattern of Tecrl during embryonic development, its expression in early mouse embryos was investigated by in&#160;situ hybridization. Tecrl was not expressed in the cardiac crescent at embryonic day E7.5 (Fig&#160;2A) but was observed at E8.5 in the entire heart with the strongest expression occurring in the developing inflow tract (Fig&#160;2B), especially in the left horn (Fig&#160;2C). At E9.5, Tecrl expression was still detectable in the atria and ventricles, albeit at lower levels whereas strong expression remained in the inflow tract (Fig&#160;2D). From E10 onwards, Tecrl was also expressed at low levels in somites, particularly in the myotome region, that gives rise to skeletal muscle (Fig&#160;2E&#8211;F). At E10.5, cardiac expression of Tecrl was no longer restricted to the inflow tract and its expression was maintained in the somites (Fig&#160;2G). At E14.5, Tecrl was expressed in the entire myocardium but not in the lungs, which served as negative control (Fig&#160;2H). In adult mice, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT&#8211;qPCR) analyses showed that Tecrl expression was highest in the heart with very low to almost undetectable levels in brain, skeletal muscle, stomach, pancreas, liver, kidney, small intestine, and uterus (Appendix&#160;Fig S1E).</text>

      <text>Next, we investigated the distribution of TECRL in human tissues. Interestingly, TECRL has important sequence identity with TECR, a gene that encodes a multi&#8208;pass membrane protein that resides in the ER, and belongs to the steroid 5&#8208;alpha reductase family (Moon &amp; Horton, 2003). Expression analysis of TECR and TECRL across a panel of human tissues clearly demonstrates that while TECR is ubiquitously expressed, TECRL is predominantly expressed in the heart and skeletal muscle (Fig&#160;2I). Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that in COS&#8208;1 cells, MYC epitope&#8208;tagged mouse Tecrl protein primarily resides in the ER (Fig&#160;2J), which was also confirmed in H10 cells by co&#8208;localization with calnexin, an ER chaperone (Fig&#160;2K&#8211;M).</text>

The pluripotent nature of the hiPSCs was further confirmed by their ability to differentiate to derivatives of all three germ layers (Fig&#160;3C).

      <text>To determine the effect of the c.331+1G&gt;A mutation in TECRL, cDNA was prepared from hiPSC&#8208;CMs and PCR analysis was performed with primers designed to target TECRL exons 2&#8211;4. A 171&#8208;bp product is expected if the mRNA of TECRL contains exon 3, whereas a 126&#8208;bp product should be present when exon 3 is missing. Analysis of the amplicons from TECRLHet&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs clearly showed two transcripts, a longer product containing exon 3 and a shorter DNA fragment lacking exon 3 (Fig&#160;3G; left image). As expected, CTRL&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs exclusively yielded the longer PCR product corresponding to 171&#160;bp. On the contrary, PCR analysis of TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs revealed a single product of 126&#160;bp (Fig&#160;3G; left image), indicating that the c.331+1G&gt;A mutation in the splice donor site of TECRL intron 3 causes complete skipping of exon 3. Amplification of the entire TECRL coding region showed a shorter PCR product (1,046&#160;bp) of TECRL from TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs compared to the 1,091&#8208;bp amplicon of CTRL&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs (Fig&#160;3G; right image). Nucleotide sequencing analysis of the PCR product from TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs confirmed deletion of 45&#160;bp corresponding to exon 3.</text>

There was a 52% reduction in RYR2 protein and 85% reduction in CASQ2 protein in TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs, while SERCA2a, PLB, NCX, and Cav1.2 protein levels were unaffected (Appendix&#160;Fig S3).</text>

      <text>Next, we studied intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) transients of TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs. Fig&#160;4A shows typical [Ca2+]i transient recordings of CTRL&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs, TECRLHet&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs, and TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs following 1&#8208;Hz electrical stimulation. A summary of average [Ca2+]i characteristics is shown in Fig&#160;4B and C. The [Ca2+]i transient rose markedly slower in TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs than in CTRL&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs (Fig&#160;4A) resulting in a significant difference in the time required to reach 50% of the [Ca2+]i transient amplitude, t1/2 (Fig&#160;4B). While there were no significant differences in systolic [Ca2+]i, the diastolic [Ca2+]i was markedly higher in TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs compared with CTRL&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs (Fig&#160;4B). Consequently, the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transient was lower in TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs (Fig&#160;4C). Furthermore, the decay of the [Ca2+]i transient was remarkably slower in TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs, as indicated by the significant increase in the time constant (tau) of decay (Fig&#160;4C).</text>

      <text>To gain further insight into the observed differences in [Ca2+]i transient properties of TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs and ascertain the cause of slower decay time, we measured the activity of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA), Na+&#8208;Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), and the slow mechanisms (mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter and sarcolemmal Ca2+ ATPase) in Ca2+ extrusion from the cytoplasm by application of the RYR2 agonist, caffeine, and the NCX1 blocker, NiCl2 (Bassani &amp; Bers, 1995; D&#237;az et&#160;al, 2004). About 10&#160;mM caffeine induced fast release of Ca2+ from the SR into the cytosol and SERCA activity (K SERCA) was analyzed by comparing the rates of decay of spontaneous [Ca2+]i transients (K sys) and caffeine&#8208;evoked transients (K caff). The role of NCX in Ca2+ removal from the cytoplasm was obtained through subtraction of the rate of decay of&#160;the caffeine&#8208;evoked [Ca2+]i transients (K caff) from that of caffeine&#8208;evoked [Ca2+]i transients in the presence of 10&#160;mM NiCl2 (K Caff+Ni).

      <text>The amplitude of caffeine&#8208;evoked [Ca2+]i transients in the presence of NiCl2 was considerably lower in TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs compared with CTRL&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs (Fig&#160;5B). However, fractional Ca2+ release, which is a measure of the amplitude of the normal systolic [Ca2+]i transient as a fraction of the amplitude of caffeine&#8208;evoked [Ca2+]i transient in the presence of NiCl2, did not differ significantly between the groups (Fig&#160;5B). K SERCA and K NCX were significantly lower in TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs compared with CTRL&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs (Fig&#160;5C).

SERCA and NCX removed &#8776;65&#8211;70% and 25&#8211;30% of the activator Ca2+ from the cytosol, respectively, whereas the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and sarcolemmal Ca2+&#8208;ATPase accounted for the removal of &lt;&#160;8% of [Ca2+]i.</text>

      <text>Increased diastolic [Ca2+]i is believed to be a substrate for delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) leading to triggered arrhythmias which maybe further aggravated by catecholaminergic stimulation. TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs showed elevated diastolic [Ca2+]i which prompted us to investigate their action potential (AP) properties. We also studied the AP parameters of hESC&#8208;CMs with TECRL knockdown in order to compare their electrophysiological phenotype to TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs.</text>

Representative APs and averaged AP parameters of hiPSC&#8208;CMs from CTRL, TECRLHet, and TECRLHom lines paced at 1&#8208;Hz are shown in Fig&#160;6B and C.

      <text>Next, we performed lentiviral short hairpin (sh) RNA&#8208;mediated knockdown of TECRL in hESC&#8208;CMs to study their AP properties. Lentiviral vectors encoding five different TECRL&#8208;specific shRNAs (Appendix&#160;Table&#160;S3) for TECRL were tested in hESC&#8208;CMs, two of which (TECRL&#8208;sh#3 and TECRL&#8208;sh#4) gave efficient knockdown as assessed by RT&#8211;qPCR. Primer sequences are provided in Appendix Table S4. However, following puromycin selection, hESC&#8208;CMs treated with TECRL&#8208;sh#4 showed pronounced cytotoxicity (Appendix&#160;Fig S4A). Therefore, TECRL&#8208;sh#3 (hereinafter referred to as shTECRL) was selected for further experiments and transduction in hESC&#8208;CMs resulted in 70% reduction in TECRL mRNA level in comparison with cells exposed to a control vector (shCONTR; Appendix&#160;Fig S4B). hESC&#8208;CMs transduced with shCONTR or shTECRL maintained their cardiac phenotype and knockdown of TECRL in hESC&#8208;CMs did not affect TNNT2 expression (Appendix&#160;Fig&#160;S4B). AP parameters of shCONTR&#8208; or shTECRL&#8208;transduced hESC&#8208;CMs stimulated at 1&#8208;Hz were recorded, and representative traces as well as averaged data are shown in Appendix&#160;Fig S4C and D. RMP, dV/dt max, APAmax, and APAplat did not differ significantly between the two experimental groups (Appendix&#160;Fig S4D). However, hESC&#8208;CMs treated with shTECRL displayed significantly prolonged APs as evidenced by the increase in APD20, APD50, and APD90 values (Appendix&#160;Fig S4D). In addition, Western blotting for canonical calcium&#8208;handling proteins revealed a 56% decrease in RYR2 protein and 18% decrease in CASQ2 in shTECRL&#8208;treated hESC&#8208;CMs while SERCA2a, PLB, NCX1, and Cav1.2 protein levels were unaffected (Appendix&#160;Fig S4E).</text>

      <text>To evaluate the susceptibility of TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs to triggered activity, we applied a fast pacing episode (3&#160;Hz; 10&#160;s), followed by a 10&#8208;s pause in the absence or presence of 10&#160;nM noradrenaline (NA). Representative traces of CTRL&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs and TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs, in the absence and presence of NA, are shown in Fig&#160;7A and C, respectively. In the absence of NA, the last stimulated AP (arrow) is followed by APs which seem to be due to diastolic depolarization rather than DADs (Fig&#160;7A) since the frequency of such &#8220;triggered&#8221; APs did not differ significantly between the experimental groups (Fig&#160;7B). Moreover, the prevalence of &#8220;triggered&#8221; and spontaneous APs (i.e., APs elicited without a fast pacing protocol) was also found to be similar in the absence of NA (Fig&#160;7B), which further suggests that the &#8220;triggered&#8221; APs in Fig&#160;7A are not due to DADs. However, in the presence of NA, &#8220;triggered&#8221; APs were abundantly present in TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs compared with CTRL&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs (Fig&#160;7C). The incidence of &#8220;triggered&#8221; APs was also significantly higher than that of spontaneous APs (Fig&#160;7D), indicating that the higher frequency of &#8220;triggered&#8221; APs in TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs is due to DADs rather than spontaneous activity. Similar to what was observed for [Ca2+]i transient properties, AP properties and susceptibility to triggered activity of TECRLHet&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs were largely in between those of CTRL&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs and TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs.</text>

      <text>Figure&#160;8A shows typical APs of a TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CM in the absence and presence of flecainide. The average effects of flecainide on AP parameters in all three hiPSC&#8208;CM groups are summarized in Fig&#160;8B. Flecainide reduced the dV/dt max and caused AP prolongation in all three groups without affecting the RMP (Fig&#160;8B). These effects did not differ significantly between the groups. Figure&#160;8C shows typical examples of triggered (top) and spontaneous (bottom) APs of a TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CM in the absence and presence of flecainide. The averaged effects of the drug on triggered and spontaneous activity in the three experimental groups are summarized in Fig&#160;8D. While flecainide reduced the frequency of both triggered and spontaneous activity (Fig&#160;8D), these reductions were not significantly different between the three groups. However, the reduction in triggered activity was more pronounced than that of spontaneous activity in TECRLHet&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs and TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs (Fig&#160;8D). These results suggest that a treatment regimen with flecainide might be effective in preventing arrhythmias in patients carrying the TECRLc.331+1G&gt;A mutation.</text>

      <text>The etiology of a number of IADs remains unknown, and similar diagnostic challenges are seen in other cardiac diseases. For example, LQTS is a condition with monogenic inheritance for which hundreds of rare mutations have been reported in 16 genes (LQTS1&#8208;16). LQTS patients are grouped into distinct syndromes based on their clinical characteristics as well as their genotypes. However, 30% of patients are without a genetically confirmed diagnosis and remain at risk of cardiac events and sudden death (Tester &amp; Ackerman, 2006). Similarly, in CPVT, 35&#8211;45% of the patients without a known genetic cause remain at risk for adverse arrhythmic events (Ackerman et&#160;al, 2011). WES has emerged as a means to meet this challenge (Biesecker &amp; Green, 2014). In the current study, we used WES to identify TECRL as a novel life&#8208;threatening inherited arrhythmia gene associated with a recessive form of inherited arrhythmia with a clinical phenotype that has overlapping features of LQTS and CPVT.</text>

      <text>Clinically, affected individuals from the Sudanese family and both French Canadian cases presented with stress&#8208;induced ventricular arrhythmias including SCD or aborted SCD. At rest, the QTc was normal or mildly prolonged while pharmacological sympathetic stimulation resulted in paradoxical QT prolongation as demonstrated in the French Canadian cases. Notably, affected individuals in the Sudanese family presented arrhythmias in childhood while the onset of symptoms in both French Canadian patients was in early adulthood. The most likely explanation for this difference in the age of onset is the more drastic effect of the splice site mutation identified in the Sudanese family. In all cases, the disease is highly penetrant and life&#8208;threatening, with all affected individuals having experienced cardiac arrest at a young age. The French Canadian cases also showed recurrent stress&#8208;induced AT, which sometimes triggered VT. In contrast, no atrial arrhythmia was documented in the Sudanese family. This may be due to the shorter follow&#8208;up related to the high lethality of the disease, as well as differences in monitoring (the French Canadian patients have a dual&#8208;chamber ICDs, with continuous monitoring of the atrial ECG). The heart was structurally normal in all affected individuals, with the exception of two individuals in the Sudanese family that also had tetralogy of Fallot. Whether these congenital heart defects are part of the same syndrome or are caused by another genetic defect in this consanguineous family remains unclear. During longer follow&#8208;up of the French Canadian cases, it was noted that less potent beta&#8208;blockers (metoprolol and bisoprolol) are associated with arrhythmia recurrence, while maximal tolerated doses of nadolol were highly effective.</text>

      <text>Whether the clinical phenotype should be classified as LQTS or CPVT is a subject of discussion. Despite having nearly identical phenotypes, the Sudanese family was diagnosed with CPVT, while the French Canadian cases were diagnosed with LQTS. The arrhythmias were induced by catecholaminergic stimulation, and most affected individuals had a normal baseline QTc, which together suggest CPVT. In contrast, mild QTc prolongation in some patients and the paradoxical QT prolongation during catecholaminergic stimulation indicate a LQTS phenotype (Obeyesekere et&#160;al, 2011). Such an overlapping clinical phenotype is also observed in calmodulin&#8208;related inherited arrhythmia (Makita et&#160;al, 2014), as well as in KCNJ2 mutations causing Andersen&#8208;Tawil syndrome, which can present as LQTS or CPVT phenocopies (Kimura et&#160;al, 2012). Therefore, we recommend that a homozygous mutation in TECRL should be considered as a possible cause of the etiology in patients presenting with stress&#8208;induced complex ventricular arrhythmias or cardiac arrest at a young age, whether they are diagnosed with (gene&#8208;elusive) LQTS or CPVT. The identification of additional families with the same syndrome and genetic defect could help in better characterizing/categorizing the phenotype.</text>

      <text>Using murine and human tissues as well as cell lines, we showed that TECRL expression is restricted to cardiac and skeletal muscles and that most of the TECRL protein is localized to the ER, which is a critical site of protein, lipid, and glucose metabolism as well as calcium homeostasis. Accordingly, reactome pathway analysis indicates a role for TECRL in fatty acid and lipid metabolism while gene ontology annotates its function as an enzyme involved in catalysis of redox reactions. In the adult heart, free fatty acids are the primary substrate for energy production at rest and abnormalities in fatty acid oxidation have been linked to arrhythmias (Bonnet et&#160;al, 1999). Perturbations in physiological levels of lipids/fatty acids and metabolic function can have direct consequences on ion channels and calcium&#8208;handling proteins (Charnock, 1994; Boland &amp; Drzewiecki, 2008; Barth &amp; Tomaselli, 2009). Further studies are necessary to elucidate the role of TECRL in lipid metabolism and how mutations are linked to cardiac arrhythmias.</text>

      <text>Altered calcium homeostasis is a hallmark of CPVT phenotype, and mutations in RYR2 or CASQ2 have been identified to cause this disease. Interestingly, protein levels of RYR2 and CASQ2 were significantly downregulated in TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs. We also found a smaller [Ca2+]i transient amplitude in these CMs. Since the Ca2+ concentration in the SR is a major regulator of the [Ca2+]i transient amplitude, this finding suggests a lower SR Ca2+ content in TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs. Indeed, caffeine&#8208;evoked transients in the presence of 10&#160;mM NiCl2, which are an indicator of SR Ca2+ content, were significantly lower in TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs, which could be associated with downregulation of RYR2.</text>

      <text>Additionally, the diastolic [Ca2+]i concentration was significantly higher in TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs than in CTRL&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs, which could explain their increased propensity to DADs upon adrenergic stimulation with NA. The increase in diastolic [Ca2+]i in TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs may in part be reasoned by the observed decrease in SERCA and NCX activity. Although we did not observe a decrease in protein levels of SERCA2A and NCX in TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs compared with CTRL&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs, we noted a decrease in their activity by functional studies. It has been established that a number of post&#8208;translational modifications regulate the activity of ionophoric proteins, which could clarify the observed effects (Ruknudin et&#160;al, 2007; Stammers et&#160;al, 2015). Decreased NCX activity has been shown to reduce DAD amplitude resulting in fewer spontaneous APs (B&#246;geholz et&#160;al, 2015). However, in our model, despite a lower NCX activity in TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs compared with CTRL&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs, the increased diastolic [Ca2+]i was sufficient to induce DADs and subsequent triggered APs.</text>

      <text>We also assessed the relative contribution of SERCA, NCX, and the slow mechanisms to [Ca2+]i removal from the cytosol. In isolated adult ventricular CMs, the decline of the [Ca2+]i transient is mainly due to reuptake of Ca2+ into the SR by SERCA and extrusion of Ca2+ via sarcolemmal NCX with a minor contribution of the slow mechanisms (Bers, 2006; Dibb et&#160;al, 2007). Our results correlate with this existing data suggesting that the Ca2+ transport systems in hiPSC&#8208;CMs are similar to those reported in adult human and animal CMs (Bers, 2000).</text>

      <text>At the single cell level, APs of TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs showed an increase in APD20. Although not significant, APD50 and APD90 were also prolonged, compatible with the borderline QTc prolongation in some of the Sudanese patients or with repolarization abnormalities with QT prolongation occasionally seen on the resting ECG of patient 1. Interestingly, hESC&#8208;CMs with TECRL knockdown exhibited markedly prolonged APD20, APD50, and APD90. Collectively, these findings are consistent with an overlapping LQTS/CPVT phenotype in TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs manifested by APD prolongation (LQTS) as well as a disturbed calcium handling and increased propensity for DADs during catecholaminergic stimulation (CPVT).</text>

      <text>Finally, we demonstrated that the antiarrhythmic drug flecainide suppressed the incidence of triggered APs in TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs. Flecainide was first classified as a blocker of Na+ current (INa), and more recently, it has been shown to reduce exercise&#8208;induced arrhythmias in CPVT patients (Watanabe et&#160;al, 2009; van der Werf et&#160;al, 2011). In agreement with flecainide's effect as INa blocker, we observed a decrease in AP upstroke velocity. We also observed AP prolongation, as previously reported in isolated human cardiac tissue (Wang et&#160;al, 1990). The precise mechanisms by which flecainide exerts an antiarrhythmic effect is unclear, but has been proposed to be due to reduced opening of RYR2 channels (Watanabe et&#160;al, 2009) or INa blockade resulting in decreased excitability (Liu et&#160;al, 2011; Bannister et&#160;al, 2015), or a combination of both (Watanabe et&#160;al, 2009). Although not conclusive, our results suggest that depression of the upstroke velocity of the AP and the consequential decrease in excitability contributes to the observed reduction in triggered activity. It is encouraging that flecainide reduced the incidence of triggered activity in TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs. However, some DADs were still observed emphasizing the need for additional or more effective drugs to prevent their occurrence in TECRLHom&#8208;hiPSC&#8208;CMs. Moreover, the IKr blocking and consequential QT&#8208;prolonging effect of flecainide may potentially offset its beneficial effect on the triggered activity. CMs generated from patient&#8208;specific hiPSCs were valuable to study the functional consequences of the c.331+1G&gt;A mutation in TECRL. The apparent immature phenotype of hiPSC&#8208;CMs (e.g., APD&#160;&lt;&#160;200&#160;ms) as opposed to freshly isolated human adult ventricular CMs evidently did not preclude their use in disease modeling.</text>

      <text>In conclusion, we identified a novel highly lethal autosomal recessive inherited arrhythmia syndrome caused by homozygous mutations in TECRL in patients from three different families. Both clinical data from patients and cellular functional data from hiPSC&#8208;CMs point toward overlapping features of LQTS and CPVT with triggered activity&#8208;mediated arrhythmogenesis. Further studies are needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms underlying the electrical phenotype and to assess the prevalence of TECRL mutations in LQTS, CPVT, and cases of unexplained cardiac arrest. hiPSC lines from more patients or introduction of targeted mutations in healthy control lines may be of value in this context. Screening for mutations in TECRL should be considered in selected cases of suspected autosomal recessive inherited arrhythmia syndromes.</text>

      <text>Here, we presented the clinical phenotype of patients from three different families with exercise&#8208;induced arrhythmias and identified mutations in the gene, TECRL by whole&#8208;exome sequencing. We generated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from an affected patient and differentiated these to cardiomyocytes (CMs). We uncovered electrophysiological and calcium&#8208;handling abnormalities in CMs with a TECRL mutation compared to hiPSC&#8208;CMs generated from an unaffected family member. Moreover, mutant cells were prone to an increase in triggered electrical activity upon catecholaminergic stimulation with noradrenaline. This could be partially rescued by treatment with a class Ic antiarrhythmic drug, flecainide.</text>

      <text>Our study demonstrated that TECRL mutations are associated with a complex clinical phenotype with characteristics of both long QT syndrome (LQTS) and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). Screening for mutations in TECRL should be implemented in symptomatic patient cohorts negative for mutations in classical LQTS and CPVT genes. This study also reiterates the importance of hiPSC models, especially valuable to assess the effect of novel gene variants on disease phenotype. In summary, findings presented in this study have major implications for improving diagnosis and management of inherited arrhythmia syndromes.</text>
