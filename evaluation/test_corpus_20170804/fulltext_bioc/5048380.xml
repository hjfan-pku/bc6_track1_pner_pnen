      <text>The 7SK snRNA sequesters P&#8208;TEFb, a general transcription elongation factor and human co&#8208;factor for HIV&#8208;1 Tat protein, into the catalytically inactive 7SK snRNP. Little is known about how 7SK RNA is regulated to perform this function. Here, we show that most of 7SK is pseudouridylated at position U250 by the predominant cellular pseudouridine synthase machinery, the DKC1&#8211;box H/ACA RNP. Pseudouridylation is critical to stabilize 7SK snRNP, as its abolishment by either mutation at or around U250 or depletion of DKC1, the catalytic component of the box H/ACA RNP, disrupts 7SK snRNP and releases P&#8208;TEFb to form the super elongation complex (SEC) and the Brd4&#8211;P&#8208;TEFb complex. The SEC is then recruited by Tat to the HIV&#8208;1 promoter to stimulate viral transcription and escape from latency. Thus, although 7SK RNA levels remain mostly unchanged, its function is modulated by pseudouridylation, which in turn controls transcription of both HIV&#8208;1 and cellular genes.</text>

      <text>The 7SK RNA is an abundant non&#8208;coding nuclear RNA highly conserved in vertebrates 1, 2. Despite its first detection in human cells in the 1970s 3, little was known about its function for the next quarter of century. In 2001, two independent studies 4, 5 identified 7SK as a critical regulator of the homeostasis and activity of P&#8208;TEFb, a key human transcription factor and a specific host cofactor for HIV&#8208;1 transcription.</text>

      <text>7SK was identified during the isolation of nuclear factors that can bind and control the activity of P&#8208;TEFb. Composed of cyclin&#8208;dependent kinase&#8208;9 (CDK9) and its partner cyclin T (CycT1 or the minor T2a and T2b) 2, P&#8208;TEFb phosphorylates a pair of negative elongation factors (DSIF and NELF) and the C&#8208;terminal domain of RNA polymerase (Pol) II. These events antagonize the inhibitory actions of the negative factors and stimulate Pol II elongation and co&#8208;transcriptional RNA processing 2.</text>

      <text>P&#8208;TEFb is an integral component of the multi&#8208;subunit super elongation complex (SEC) that is recruited by the HIV&#8208;1&#8208;encoded Tat protein to the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) to stimulate viral transcription elongation 6, 7. It cooperates with another elongation stimulatory factor ELL1 or ELL2 that resides in the same SEC to synergistically produce full&#8208;length HIV&#8208;1 transcripts essential for productive viral replication. As such, P&#8208;TEFb and the encompassing SEC are cellular co&#8208;factors required for maximal Tat&#8208;transactivation and efficient escape from viral latency 6, 8, 9.</text>

      <text>Under normal growth conditions and depending on the cell type, up to 90% of cellular P&#8208;TEFb is sequestered in another multi&#8208;subunit complex called the 7SK snRNP 2. This RNP also contains HEXIM1 or HEXIM2, which inhibit CDK9, and MePCE and LARP7, which protect 7SK integrity by binding to the 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; end of the RNA, respectively. The 7SK RNP functions as a cellular reservoir for excess P&#8208;TEFb to keep it in an inactive state 2. Under conditions that globally affect cell growth or induce stress response, P&#8208;TEFb is released from 7SK RNP to form the SEC and the Brd4&#8211;P&#8208;TEFb complex to stimulate transcription and regulate growth. The bromodomain protein Brd4 present in the latter complex recruits P&#8208;TEFb to many primary response genes to promote their expression 10, 11, 12. Notably, P&#8208;TEFb can also be extracted from 7SK RNP by Tat to form Tat&#8211;SEC for activation of the HIV&#8208;1 LTR 2.</text>

      <text>The 7SK RNA is constitutively produced by RNA Pol III from a multi&#8208;gene family 1, 4. Although its levels remain relatively constant, a recent genomewide study 13 suggests that it may undergo a type of post&#8208;transcriptional modification termed pseudouridylation, which could potentially alter its structure and function. Pseudouridylation is one of the most frequent internal modifications found in stable non&#8208;coding RNA and produces the C5&#8208;glycosidic isomer of uridine (&#936;) 14. While the pseudouridylation of 7SK has been suggested in this high&#8208;throughput study, biochemical and functional validation of this modification has yet to be performed. Here, we provide direct biochemical proof that the vast majority of cellular 7SK RNA is pseudouridylated at residue U250. Our data demonstrate a key role for &#936;250 in controlling the formation of 7SK RNP and show that the DKC1&#8211;box H/ACA RNP is mostly responsible for this modification. Impairment of the modification through DKC1 depletion preferentially activates Tat&#8208;dependent HIV&#8208;1 transcription and promotes reversal of viral latency by enhancing SEC's binding to Tat and the HIV&#8208;1 LTR.</text>

      <text>We first sought to biochemically confirm results from a recent genomewide study suggesting that 7SK RNA is pseudouridylated at residue U250 13. To avoid possible false&#8208;positive signals that can arise in this type of study that employed reverse transcription and primer extension of structured RNAs, we instead evaluated 7SK pseudouridylation directly using an in vitro modification assay and thin&#8208;layer chromatography (TLC). 7SK was divided into six fragments (Fig 1A) and in vitro transcribed in the presence of 32P&#8208;UTP. Following incubation with HeLa NE and digestion by nuclease P1, products were resolved by one&#8208;dimensional TLC (1D&#8208;TLC) along with pU and p&#936; as controls. Only fragment 5 containing U250 yielded p&#936; (Fig 1B). To confirm that the modification indeed selectively occurred at U250, the same analysis was performed with mutant 7SK containing U250 replaced with G (U250G). This change completely abolished the production of p&#936; (Fig 1C). Furthermore, using a modified SCARLET (Site&#8208;specific Cleavage And Radioactive&#8208;labeling followed by Ligation&#8208;assisted Extraction and Thin&#8208;layer chromatography) method 15 (Fig 1D) that enables site&#8208;specific labeling of U250 or the control U203 in full&#8208;length 7SK produced by in vitro transcription (IVT) or isolated from HeLa cells, only the latter sample contained p&#936; at position 250 in 94% of the population (Fig 1E). These data indicate that most 7SK RNA are pseudouridylated at U250 in vivo. Notably, U250 is present in all identified vertebrate 7SK RNA 16, suggesting a critical role of this residue in 7SK function. It remains to be tested whether this residue is also pseudouridylated in other vertebrates besides humans.</text>

      <text>To analyze the modification status of 7SK RNA bound to P&#8208;TEFb, we purified 7SK by anti&#8208;Flag immunoprecipitation from NE of F1C2 cells, a HeLa&#8208;based cell line stably expressing CDK9&#8208;Flag (Fig 1F). The purified 7SK was compared with the IVT 7SK by nuclease digestion and two&#8208;dimensional (2D)&#8208;TLC. Only the CDK9&#8208;bound but not the IVT 7SK produced a spot corresponding to p&#936; (Fig 1G, right panel, red circle). This level of modification is not low considering that U250 is only one of 75 U residues in 7SK RNA. Finally, when the CDK9&#8208;bound 7SK was site&#8208;specifically labeled at either U250 or U203 and subjected to 1D&#8208;TLC analysis, pseudouridylation at U250 but not U203 was confirmed (Fig 1H).</text>

      <text>To determine the impact of &#936;250 on formation of 7SK RNP, U250 was mutated to G to block the modification. The mutation was introduced into a version of 7SK RNA that carries a sequence tag (nt 216&#8211;221, Fig 2A) to allow discrimination from endogenous 7SK by primer extension. Compared to the tagged 7SK containing WT sequence at and around U250 (Fig 2A), the U250G mutant (mut1, Fig 2B) showed significantly reduced binding to the 7SK RNP components CDK9 and HEXIM1 but not LARP7 when expressed in HeLa cells (Fig 2G&#8211;I). As a La&#8208;related protein, LARP7 binds to the 3&#8242;&#8208;poly(U) end of 7SK 17, which may explain why its binding to 7SK was unaffected by the mutation. Notably, the U250G change also decreased the binding to hnRNP R (Fig 2J), a protein known to interact with 7SK RNA upon its release from 7SK RNP 18. To rule out the possibility that the compromised 7SK RNP formation was due to disruption of the hairpin structure by U250G, we restored base&#8208;pairing of the upper stem by mutating A228 to C at the complementary site on the opposite strand (mut2, Fig 2C). Like mut1, mut2 showed decreased bindings to CDK9, HEXIM1, and hnRNP R, but displayed the same binding capacity as WT and mut1 toward LARP7 (Figs 2K&#8211;N and EV1).</text>

      <text>In eukaryotes, pseudouridylation of non&#8208;coding RNAs is catalyzed primarily by the box H/ACA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, in which dyskerin (DKC1) serves as the catalytic subunit and the box H/ACA snoRNA guides the RNP to the targeted uridine by base&#8208;pairing with the flanking sequences 14 (Fig 2E). Importantly, the bioinformatics pipeline RNAsnoop 19 reveals extensive base&#8208;pairing between the 7SK sequences flanking U250 and the second pseudouridylation pocket of snoRNA U70.</text>

      <text>As a first step toward determining a possible role for the box H/ACA RNP in 7SK pseudouridylation, we disrupted the predicated snoRNA&#8208;7SK RNA interactions by mutating three nucleotides (C243U, U247A, and G253U) surrounding U250 in 7SK to disrupt the base&#8208;pairing with the snoRNA (Fig 2E). Two additional changes (C224A and A231U) were also made in 7SK in order to restore base&#8208;pairing to the stems both above and below U250 (Fig 2D). Just like mut1 and mut2, the new mut3 (Fig 2D), which still maintains the intact U250, also displayed defective interactions with CDK9, HEXIM1, and hnRNP R but not LARP7 (Fig 2O&#8211;R). An in vitro modification assay confirmed that all three mutants failed to undergo pseudouridylation at U250 (Fig 2F). Finally, ruling out a potential artifact caused by transient expression of tagged proteins, the ability of endogenous CDK9 to discriminate between WT and the three 7SK mutants was found to be the same as that of transfected CDK9&#8208;F (Fig EV1).</text>

      <text>Isomerization of uridine to &#936; results in the formation of an extra hydrogen bond donor capable of coordinating a water molecule 20. The resulting structural changes are largely stabilizing as they promote the RNA structural and thermal stability, and can also influence RNA&#8211;protein and RNA&#8211;RNA interactions 14. Consistent with this general view of the function of pseudouridylation, our results above demonstrate that &#936;250 in 7SK RNA promotes 7SK RNP formation by stabilizing the interactions with HEXIM1 and P&#8208;TEFb. Moreover, the box H/ACA RNP is likely responsible for the modification.</text>

      <text>To further test this idea, we constructed HeLa&#8208;based cell lines inducibly expressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) that targets DKC1 (shDKC1). The DKC1 protein level was markedly decreased upon doxycycline (DOX) treatment in two independent knockdown (KD) clones (Fig 3C). Although the 7SK RNA level remained largely unaffected by the KD (even slightly increased, Fig 3D), the &#936;250 level was drastically decreased (Fig 3E). Given that the KD efficiency was ~80%, these results indicate the box H/ACA RNP as the predominant enzyme catalyzing the pseudouridylation of 7SK in vivo, although the possible involvement of other minor modifiers cannot be completely ruled out at this stage.</text>

      <text>To determine whether the impairment of 7SK RNA pseudouridylation by DKC1 KD affects 7SK RNP formation, we performed anti&#8208;CDK9 immunoprecipitations in NE of DKC1 KD cells that were either untreated or treated with DOX to induce shDKC1 expression. The KD significantly decreased the levels of 7SK RNA, HEXIM1, and LARP7 bound to the immunoprecipitated CDK9 (Fig 3F), indicating disruption of 7SK RNP and release of P&#8208;TEFb. The same conclusion was also reached when the effect of DKC1 KD on endogenous 7SK RNP was analyzed in a glycerol gradient (Fig EV2). The KD caused HEXIM1, and to a lesser degree, CDK9 to move out of fractions 9&#8211;15 (dashed box) corresponding to the large&#8208;size 7SK snRNP to the top of the gradient that contained smaller size complexes and free proteins. Notably, although 7SK RNP can also be disrupted by certain drugs such as DRB and the CDK9 inhibitor i&#8208;CDK9 21 (Fig EV3A), the drug&#8208;induced disruption did not change the modification state of U250 (Fig EV3B).</text>

      <text>In addition to disrupting 7SK RNP, the KD also markedly increased the interactions of CDK9 with Brd4 and the SEC subunits especially AFF1 and ELL2, revealing a transfer of P&#8208;TEFb from the inactive 7SK RNP to the active Brd4&#8208;P&#8211;TEFb complex and SEC under the KD conditions. The SEC family of complexes, particularly the ones containing AFF1 and ELL2, play an important role in mediating Tat&#8208;transactivation 6, 8, 9, 22. In addition to the above demonstration that DKC1 KD promoted the SEC formation, examination of the Tat&#8208;associated proteins under the KD conditions also revealed a significant increase in the interaction of the AFF1/ELL2&#8208;SEC with Tat (Fig 3G). Together, these data support a model in which impairment of 7SK pseudouridylation by DKC1 KD shifts the P&#8208;TEFb functional equilibrium toward the active state by promoting the formation of both the Tat&#8211;SEC and Brd4&#8208;P&#8211;TEFb complexes.</text>

      <text>To investigate the functional significance of the DKC1 KD&#8208;induced release of P&#8208;TEFb from 7SK snRNP, we first examined the effect of the KD on expression of a luciferase reporter gene placed under the control of various viral and cellular gene promoters. Consistent with the observation above that the KD shifted the P&#8208;TEFb equilibrium toward the active Brd4&#8208;P&#8211;TEFb and SEC complexes, the introduction of the DKC1&#8208;specific siRNA (siDKC1) into HeLa cells produced a small but consistent increase ranging from 1.8&#8208; to 4.4&#8208;fold in luciferase expression from all the promoters tested (Fig 4A). Interestingly, although the basal, Tat&#8208;independent HIV&#8208;1 promoter activity was induced by only 2.8&#8208;fold, and the Tat&#8208;dependent activity was elevated 17.5&#8208;fold. Notably, Tat failed to activate any of the non&#8208;HIV&#8208;1 promoters used in this assay (Fig EV4).</text>

      <text>The preferential effect of the DKC1 KD on Tat&#8208;transactivation was not due to any major increase in Tat expression but instead reflects elevated HIV&#8208;1 transcription, as the qRT&#8211;PCR analyses showed an increase in the mRNA levels of luciferase but not Tat upon the KD (Fig 4B and C). It is highly likely that the enhanced Tat&#8211;SEC interaction (Fig 3G) that is known to support optimal Tat function 6, 22, 23 was responsible for this preferential effect in the KD cells. Consistently, our ChIP&#8211;qPCR analysis showed that the KD increased occupancy of SEC at the HIV&#8208;1 promoter, which in turn resulted in higher levels of both total Pol II and Ser2&#8208;phosphorylated Pol II detected at this region (Fig 4D and E).</text>

      <text>The suppression of P&#8208;TEFb activity in resting T cells through sequestration in 7SK RNP contributes to establishment of HIV&#8208;1 latency 24, 25, raising the possibility that the decreased 7SK pseudouridylation upon DKC1 KD may facilitate the reversal of viral latency by releasing P&#8208;TEFb from the RNP. To test this idea, we created inducible DKC1 KD cells in the Jurkat 2D10 system, a widely used post&#8208;integrative latency model 26. The DOX&#8208;induced depletion of ~50% of cellular DKC1 (Fig 4F) did not cause obvious cell death, but activated the LTR&#8208;driven GFP expression by ~85% (Fig 4G and H). Moreover, the KD enhanced the ability of two well&#8208;established latency&#8208;reversing agents (LRAs), JQ1 and prostratin, to induce the GFP production by ~80&#8211;100% depending on the concentrations of the drugs (Fig 4G and H). The lack of a more robust activation was likely caused by the inefficient DKC1 KD. Nevertheless, these results suggest that although the KD&#8208;induced release of P&#8208;TEFb from 7SK RNP alone may not be enough to fully reverse HIV&#8208;1 latency, it can be used in conjunction with other LRAs to further enhance their effectiveness.</text>

      <text>The data presented in this study indicate that 7SK is pseudouridylated predominately by the DKC1&#8211;box H/ACA RNPs. Although these RNPs also modify other RNA including spliceosomal snRNA and ribosomal rRNA, which could broadly influence gene expression, we believe this is unlikely to account for the preferential activation of HIV&#8208;1 Tat function observed here. Both the DKC1 KD and mutagenesis that disrupt the pseudouridylation target sequence in 7SK resulted in a redistribution of P&#8208;TEFb from the inactive 7SK RNP to the active Tat&#8211;SEC that is required for optimal Tat&#8208;transactivation.</text>

      <text>According to the structural model proposed by Wassarman and Steitz 1, 7SK RNA contains four hairpins and U250 resides in the third one. Previously, HEXIM1 and P&#8208;TEFb have been shown to bind to two distinct elements located in the 5&#8242;&#8208; and 3&#8242;&#8208;terminal hairpins of 7SK 27. Surprisingly, the deletion of the middle portion of 7SK including the third hairpin did not disrupt these interactions. There are two possible explanations for the apparent discrepancy between these results and our current findings. The first is that the lack of pseudouridylation at U250 may change the overall folding and structure of the entire 7SK molecule including the terminal 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; hairpins, which in turn decreases binding by HEXIM1 and P&#8208;TEFb. In contrast, the simple deletion of the 3rd hairpin does not produce such a global effect and may still allow the two terminal hairpins to form independently and bind HEXIM1 and P&#8208;TEFb. The second possibility is that the loss of pseudouridylation at U250 may enable the recruitment of an unknown factor that interferes with 7SK RNP formation. In this scenario, the deletion of the 7SK middle section causes loss of the binding site for this factor, and thus, no disruption of 7SK RNP occurs. Future studies are necessary to test these two possibilities and directly measure the impact of &#936;250 on 7SK's global structure and folding.</text>

      <text>Our findings that targeting DKC1 inhibits 7SK pseudouridylation and affects P&#8208;TEFb transcriptional activity also have important clinical implications, as mutations in DKC1 are associated with a number of human diseases, including X&#8208;linked dyskeratosis congenita (X&#8208;DC) and the Hoyeraal&#8211;Hreidarsson syndrome 28, 29. Furthermore, X&#8208;DC mutations in DKC1 are known to impair pseudouridylation and stability of various box H/ACA snoRNAs 30. In light of these, future studies are needed to determine whether defects in 7SK RNA pseudouridylation and P&#8208;TEFb regulation contribute to the pathology of the DKC1 diseases.</text>

      <text>Efforts are currently underway to develop effective strategies to &#8220;shock&#8221; the latent HIV reservoirs for their subsequent &#8220;kill&#8221; by anti&#8208;retroviral therapy 24, 31. Several LRAs have been used in the &#8220;shock&#8221; phase of the therapy but are highly toxic or ineffective, and thus, new and improved LRAs are needed 32, 33. Our present data support the idea that the 7SK RNP plays an inhibitory role in HIV's transcription and escape from latency. The demonstration that this RNP can be destabilized by reducing 7SK RNA pseudouridylation, which activates HIV transcription and promotes latency reversal, implicates the DKC1&#8211;box H/ACA RNPs as a promising new target for developing novel LRAs to eradicate latent viral reservoirs.</text>

      <text>To generate the HeLa&#8208; or Jurkat 2D10&#8208;based inducible DKC1 KD cells, a specific shRNA (shDKC1) sequence 5&#8242;&#8208;CCGGGGACAGGTTTCATTAATCTTTCAAGAGAAGATTAATGAAACCTGTCCTTTTTTG&#8208;3&#8242; was inserted into the Tet&#8208;on&#8208;pLKO lentiviral vector 41, 42. shRNA targeting GFP was used as a non&#8208;targeting control. Lentivirus production and infection were conducted as described 43. The KD was induced by DOX for 5 days. To reduce DKC1 expression in the HeLa&#8208;based NH1 cells 44, siDKC1 SMARTpool (L&#8208;013639&#8208;00&#8208;0005, Dharmacon) or the non&#8208;targeting pool (D&#8208;001810&#8208;10, Dharmacon) was transfected using INTERFERin siRNA transfection reagents (Polyplus&#8208;transfection, Cat. 409&#8208;10).</text>

      <text>The assay was performed as described 44 with some modifications. Briefly, NH1 cells containing the integrated HIV&#8208;1 LTR&#8208;luciferase reporter construct and transfected with the Tat expression constructs were cross&#8208;linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min and then quenched by 0.125 M glycine for 5 min. Fixed cells were collected and lysed in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.1). Chromatin DNA was fragmented to ~200&#8211;1,000 bp in length with the Covaris&#8208;S2 sonicator (Covaris). One&#8208;tenth of the sonicated lysates were incubated overnight with 3 &#956;g of the indicated antibodies per reaction and then with Protein A Dynabeads (Life Technologies) for 1 h. After extensively wash, immunoprecipitated DNA was purified by PCR Purification kit (QIAGEN) and analyzed by qPCR. All qPCR signals were normalized to the input, and signals generated by immunoprecipitations with rabbit total IgG were subtracted from the signals obtained by the specific antibodies. The sequences of the PCR primers used for amplification of the HIV&#8208;1 LTR are: Forward, 5&#8242;&#8208;GTTAGACCAGATCTGAGCCCT&#8208;3&#8242;; Reverse, 5&#8242;&#8208;GTGGGTTCCCTAGTTAGCCA&#8208;3&#8242;.</text>
