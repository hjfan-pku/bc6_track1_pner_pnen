      <text>(B) CHD1 is recruited to an I-SceI-induced DSB site and is co-localized with &#947;H2AX. Immunofluorescence studies using U2OS19 ptight13 GFP-LacRcells containing a stably integrated I-SceI cleavage site flanked by 256 copies of lac operator (lacO) on one side and 96 copies of the tetracycline response element on the other side (tetO). The localization of the GFP-lac repressor protein (GFP-LacR) at the lac-operator DNA sequences in the nucleus before (&#8722; I-SceI) and 16 h after I-SceI-induced (+ I-SceI) DSB. After 16 h of doxy treatment, CHD1 and &#947;H2AX co-localized at I-SceI cleavage site, along with DNA-bound GFP-LacR but not in uninduced cells (&#8722;I-SceI). Scale bar 10 &#181;m.</text>
