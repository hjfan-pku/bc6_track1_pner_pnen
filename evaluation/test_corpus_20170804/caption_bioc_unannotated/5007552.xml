      <text>ZR-75-1 and CAMA-1 cell lines were treated with 1 &#181;M MK-2206 or 1 &#181;M AZD5363, for indicated time periods. Cell lysates were subjected to (B) mRNA isolation followed by cDNA preparation. Real-time PCR was performed on cDNA samples using specific primers against SGK1, SGK2 and SGK3 isoforms. Relative mRNA levels were calculated using 2^(-deltadelta) Ct method using DMSO treated samples as calibrator.</text>

      <text>(C) ZR-75-1 and CAMA-1 cells were treated with 1 &#181;M MK-2206 or 1 &#181;M AZD5363 for a total of 10 days. After 7 day treatment, SGK3 was knocked down by using three different shRNA probes, named SGK3 A, B and C and compared to a control shRNA probes, named sh scramble. Cells were maintained in the presence or absence of the indicated inhibitor during this period. At day 10 cells were lysed and subjected to immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies.</text>

      <text>SGK3 [S486E]-GST and SGK3 [R90A S486]-GST were purified from HEK293 cells transiently overexpressing these enzymes. One hour prior to lysis, cells were treated with 5 &#181;M VPS34-IN1 and 5 &#181;M GSK2334470 to ensure that the SGK3 was in its inactive dephosphorylated form. (A) SGK3[S486E]-GST was incubated with lipid vesicles comprising phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylserine (PS) containing the indicted concentrations of PtdIns or PtdIns(3)P in the presence or absence of added recombinant PDK1 (50 ng) and kinase reactions were initiated by addition of MgATP. After 30 min at 30oC, PDK1 was inhibited by addition of the 1 &#181;M GSK2334470 PDK1 inhibitor and reaction mixture was supplemented with 2 &#181;g GST-NDRG1 SGK3 substrate. After another 30 min at 30oC the reaction was terminated by addition of SDS Sample Buffer. The reaction mixtures were subjected to immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies.</text>

      <text>(E) Plasma concentrations of MK-2206 and 14h were analysed in samples obtained 2-3 hours after the administration of the last dose on the 24th day of treatment. Results are presented as a mean &#177; SD from three different samples.</text>

      <text>(F) Tumours were harvested at the end of the experiment, four hours after the last dosage and subjected to immunohistochemistry analysis using cleaved Caspase 3 antibody (clCasp3) . Apoptotic sells were counted in 25 fields per each condition (left panel) and quantified as clCasp3 positive cells/field (right panel). Representative images are shown. Bar 100 &#956;m</text>

      <text>ZR-75-1 cells were treated for 5 days with 1&#181;M MK-2206 (A), 1 &#181;M AZD5363 (B), 1&#181;M GDC0941 (C) or DMSO. Human mRNAs were hybridised to NanoString human kinome and control code sets, then subjected to quantification using NanoString software. Results are presented as mRNA change of each kinase relative to mRNA isolated from control sample treated with DMSO. To permit data compaction, and simple kinome-wide comparisons, the fold changes are log2 transformed. The kinase mRNAs exhibiting prominent changes are annotated, with SGK3 highlighted in red. Similar profiles were obtained in one independent experiment.</text>
