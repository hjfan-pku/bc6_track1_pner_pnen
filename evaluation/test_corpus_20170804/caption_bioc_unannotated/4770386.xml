      <text>Figure 1 - The origin of N-terminal proteoforms. A. 2,578 proteoforms were identified including 2,135 dbTIS and 443 aTIS. For the majority of proteins we found a unique translation initiation site (grey). Additionally, 335 N-terminal peptides pointed to proteins with multiple N-termini created by alternative translation initiation (blue), whereas 81 N-termini were generated by alternative iMet processing (green). B-C. Proteomics-derived translation initiation events were verified at the transcript level using Ribo-Seq data obtained in Jurkat cells and HCT 116 cells (data unpublished). Although in this study, the degree of in vivo Nt-acetylation could not be directly determined, all retained N-termini were compliant with the rules of N-terminal processing from previous experiments (Van Damme et al, 2014). In the case N-termini were found to be in vivo Nt-acetylated (previous MS/MS-based evidence (Van Damme et al, 2014)) this information is indicated. dbTIS and aTIS peptides were further mapped to protein N-termini annotated in Swiss-Prot Isoform, UniProt TrEMBL and Ensembl databases and neo-N-termini (proteolytic products) of the knowledgebase TopFind 3.0. The number of matching N-termini is indicated in dark grey. N-terminal peptides supported by at least one source of metadata pointing to translation (Nt-acetylation, Ribo-Seq, Swiss-Prot Isoforms, TrEMBL or Ensembl) were classified as highly confident TIS (indicated in green). D. Using experimental and metadata we assigned the most likely origin of aTIS peptides and confirmed that alternative translation initiation within the same transcript (leaky scanning) contributes to the majority of alternative TIS identified.</text>

      <text>A. Jurkat cells were pre-labeled with light or medium L-Arg isotopes. A label swap was performed of cells growing in medium Arg, whereas light cells were cultured in the same medium. Cells were harvested at different time points and equal proteome amounts were mixed, followed by N-terminal COFRADIC fractionation and LC-MS/MS analysis.</text>

      <text>C. The distribution of turnover times (N=1,894) in our experiment was not unimodal, with a sizable number of quickly turned over proteins, with the median protein turnover rate being 21.6 h. The doubling time of Jurkat cells (24 h) is indicated in red.</text>

      <text>B. MS spectra of the N-termini of two proteoforms originating from the aminoacyl tRNA synthase complex-interacting multifunctional protein 2 (AIMP2): a dbTIS indicative N-terminus with processed iMet and starting at the second amino acid Pro, an aTIS indicative peptide starting at position 3 and retaining its iMet. As evident from the MS spectra shown, these N-terminal proteoforms displayed largely different turnover rates.</text>

      <text>A. Jurkat cells were treated with 100 &#181;g/ml CHX for 0, 0.5, 1.5, 4, 8, 12 or 24 hours. Protein degradation was monitored by Western blotting and stabilities of several short-lived endogenous proteins were confirmed using antibodies (including lamin B, securin, &#946;-catenin, GCIP interacting protein p29) and compared to stable proteins (such as GAPDH and actin). Proteoform-specific bands were used to calculate protein half-lives which were in a good agreement with turnover times obtained from pSILAC</text>

      <text>B-C. Validation of the differential turnover time of the dbTIS and aTIS derived proteoforms of MARE2 and AN32E. Selective C-terminal V5-tagged proteoforms were overexpressed in HCT116 cells for 24 hours and CHXpulse-chase experiments were performed as described for Jurkat cells. Degradation of overexpressed proteoforms was monitored by an anti-V5 antibody and compared to the turnover of stable proteins such as actin and tubulin.</text>
