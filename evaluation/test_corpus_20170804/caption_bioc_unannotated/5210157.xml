      <text>C) Left panel: Schematic representation showing relevant genomic structure of the strain used to assess intra-chromosomal repair. The location of a MAT specific probe and the restriction endonuclease cleavage sites used for Southern blot analysis to detect repair product formation are indicated. Arrow depicts the localization of the double-strand break. Right panel: Physical analysis of intra-chromosomal repair in wild-type and cdc14-1 cultures at the semipermisive temperature. After DSB formation by the expression of the HO, glucose was added to repress it, thus allowing repair with HM donor sequences. Genomic DNA was digested with StyI, separated on agarose gel and blotted. Blots were hybridized with a probe corresponding to the MATa-distal sequence. A second probe for the actin gene was used to control the amount of genomic DNA loaded at each time-point. Immunoblot analysis of Rad53 during mating type switching experiments is shown. Coomassie blue staining is depicted as loading control. Graphs show quantification of gene conversion (GC) leading to the re-establishment of MATa or switching to MAT and DSB formation. The data was normalized with the actin loading control. Graphs show the mean &#177; S.D. from three independent experiments. Replicates were averaged and statistical significance of differences assessed by a 2-tailed unpaired Student t test.</text>

      <text>A) Left panel: Schematic diagram displaying relevant genomic structure of the strains used to measure inter-chromosomal DNA repair efficiency. The location of a MAT specific probe and the restriction endonuclease cleavage sites used for Southern blot analysis to detect repair product formation are indicated. Note that crossover and non-crossover product have different restriction fragment sizes that can be differentiated in a Southern blot assay. Arrow depicts the localization of the double-strand break. Right panel: Physical analysis of wild-type and cdc14-1 mutant strains carrying the inter-chromosomal gene conversion assay. Cells were grown overnight before adding galactose at semipermisive temperature to induce HO expression, thus producing a DSB on chromosome V. Samples were taken at different time-points, genomic DNA was extracted, digested with EcoRI and analysed by Southern blot. Blots were hybridized with a MATa-only DNA sequence and an actin probe was used as loading control. Asterisk denotes an overexposed film to visualize crossover formation. Immunoblot of Rad53 was performed as previously described. Coomassie staining is shown as a control for loading. Graphs show the mean &#177; S.D. of gene conversion, DSB induction and crossover vs non-crossover ratio from three independent experiments. All data was normalized using actin as loading control. Replicates were averaged and statistical significance of differences assessed by a 2-tailed unpaired Student t test.</text>

      <text>B) Left panel: Schematic representation depicting the genomic structure of the strains used to evaluate repair pathway choice. The location of a MAT specific probe and the restriction endonuclease cleavage sites used for Southern blot analysis to detect repair product formation are indicated. Note that the use of NHEJ or HR generates different product that can be recognized in Southern blots by the different disposition of the restriction sites for the endonucleases used. Arrow depicts the localization of the double-strand break. Right panel: Physical analysis of wild-type and cdc14-1 cells harbouring the repair pathway choice assay. Cells were grown overnight and HO induction was attained through addition of galactose for 1.5 hour at semipermisive temperature. After induction of the HO, glucose was added to repress the HO expression and samples were taken to analyse repair efficiency. DNA was extracted, digested with EcoRV, separated on agarose gels and blotted. Blots were hybridized with a probe corresponding to the MATa-only DNA sequence. A second probe to the HIS3gene was used to control the amount of genomic DNA loaded at each time-point. Graphs show quantification of mating type switching by gene conversion (HR), restoration of MATa (NHEJ) and the kinetics of the DSB induction. All data was normalized with the HIS3 gene. Graphs show the mean &#177; S.D. from three independent experiments. Replicates were averaged and statistical significance of differences assessed by a 2-tailed unpaired Student t test.</text>

      <text>D) Live-cell imaging of Cdc14 localization in the presence of a non-reparable DSB at the MAT locus. Cells were grown overnight and the HO endonuclease was expressed by adding galactose to the media, thus producing a DSB on chromosome III. Cdc14, the SPB component Cnm67 and the DNA damage checkpoint protein Ddc2 (used as DSB reporter) were labelled with the green, red and cyan fluorescent proteins respectively. Micrographs display the maximum projection of 9 planes showing Cdc14 co-localizing with the DSB and the SPBs in response to DNA damage (arrows). Scale bar: 3&#956;m. Graphs represent the percentage &#177; SD from three independents experiment of cells with nucleoplasmic Cdc14 along the HO endonuclease induction (left graph) and the percentage of Cdc14-SPB-DSB co-localization after 5h in galactose (right graph).</text>

      <text>C) An RFP-marked I-SceI recognition site is re-localized to the SPBs after expressing the endonuclease. Cells harbouring a TetO array adjacent to the I-SceI site and a plasmid containing the endonuclease under the control of the galactose promoter were grown overnight in SC-Ade prior galactose induction. To check reproducibility with previous results a Rad52-CFP was used. Cnm67 was labelled with the GFP to be used as SPB reporter. D1, D2 and D3 distances were measured in wild-type and cdc14-1 mutants before and after endonuclease expression by using both TetI-RFP and Rad52-CFP foci using the maximum projection of nine z-planes images. Graphs represent the average of three independent experiments. P values were calculated using a 2-tailed unpaired Student t test.

      <text>A) Identification of Cdc14 phospho-targets during the DNA damage response by mass spectrometry analysis. Wild-type and cdc14-1 cells were grown overnight and blocked in G2/M by using nocodazole to avoid cell cycle-dependent changes in protein phosphorylation between both strains. After the block was attained, cells were transferred to 37&#186;C for 45 minutes to deplete Cdc14 activity prior HO induction by galactose addition for 4h. Differential phosphorylation of phospho-peptides detected between the wild-type and cdc14-1 were grouped into broad categories depending on the molecular function of the proteins. The table includes the DNA damage and checkpoint-related proteins with Cdc14-dependent hyper-phosphorylated status and the relative ratio between the wild-type and cdc14-1 during the DNA damage response. Red and blue indicate relative amount of the residue phosphorylation between both strains (Red, high; Blue, low).</text>

      <text>A) Time-lapse experiments of living cells harbouring a non-reparable DSB were carried out after expressing the HO endonuclease in wild-type and cdc14-1 mutant cells. Spc110-RFP was used as SPB reporter and Tub1-GFP was used as tubulin marker. Three z-planes images every 5-second intervals over a period of 5 minutes were captured and used to quantify the average SPB track length and velocity using Spc110-RFP as SPB marker. At least 100 cells were scored.A representative maximum projection image is depicted. Scale bar: 3&#956;m.</text>

      <text>B) The steady state phosphorylation of Spc110 is required to maintain spindle polarity in response to DNA damage. Wild-type, cdc14-1 and spc110S36-91A cells expressing Spc110-RFP were scored for their ability to maintain spindle polarity at the axial plane of the cell upon induction of a single DSB induced by the HO endonuclease. A maximum projection of nine z-planes was used to score the cells. At least 100 cells from three independent experiments were scored. Graph represents the percentage &#177; SD of cells with oriented/miss-oriented SPBs with respect to the axial plane of the cell. P value was calculated using a 2-tailed unpaired Student t test.</text>

      <text>C) The asymmetric loading of dynein into astral MTs emanating from the daughter SPB is affected in cdc14-1 and spc110S36-91A cells during the DNA damage response. Dynein distribution on astral MTs emerging from each SPB was scored by using Dyn1-GFP in strains containing Spc110-RFP. Graph represents the percentage &#177; SD of cells grouped into three categories depending on the pattern of dynein distribution on astral MTs: Type1, Dynein is exclusively loaded on astral MTs emerging from the daughter SPB; Type 2, Dynein is equally loaded on astral MTs emanating from both SPBs; Type 3, Dynein is absent from astral MTs. At least 100 cells from three independent experiments were scored. A representative picture showing the three patterns is included. Scale bar: 3&#956;m.</text>

      <text>B) Physical analysis of wild-type cells containing the repair pathway choice assay described in Fig 2B. The diagram with the genomic information, the restriction enzymes used and the location of the probe are shown. Cells were synchronized in G1 by using the &#945;-factor pheromone and released into fresh media for 1 hour. Induction of HO expression was attained by adding galactose for 2 hours. After formation of the DSB, glucose was added to repress the HO in the presence of nocodazole or mock DMSO and samples were taken to analyse the kinetics of the repair. DNA was extracted, digested with EcoRV, separated on agarose gels and blotted. Both probes for the MATa-distal sequence and the HIS3 gene (as loading control) were used. Graphs show the quantification of MATa restoration (NHEJ), mating type switching by gene conversion (HR), and DSB kinetics formation. All data were normalized with the HIS3 gene. Graphs show the mean &#177; S.D. from three independent experiments. P values were calculated using a 2-tailed unpaired Student t test.</text>
