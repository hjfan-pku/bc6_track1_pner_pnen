      <text>A panel of 42 breast cancer cell lines was challenged with increasing concentrations of ATRA (11 nM-10 &#956;M) for 3, 6, and 9 days, and cell growth was determined. The graphs show the growth-inhibitory effect exerted by the indicated concentrations of ATRA in SKBR3, HCC-1954, and MDA-MB436 cells which are representative of lines characterized by a high, intermediate and low ATRA score, respectively. Each point is the mean &#177; SD of three replicate cultures. **Significantly lower than the corresponding vehicle-treated group (P-value &lt; 0.01, Student's t-test).</text>

      <text>Cell lines are ranked in ascending order according to the ATRA score. The plot distinguishes four separate groups of cell lines (D-A) with increasing ATRA scores, as indicated by the colored scale on the right. The cell lines are also grouped in tertiles, T1-T3, according to an ascending ATRA score. Each calculated value is representative of at least two independent experiments.</text>

      <text>A RAR&#945;1/3 plasmid construct and the corresponding control void vector were stably transfected into ATRA-resistantMDA-MB453 cells. Two cell clones over-expressing RAR&#945; (RARA-C5 andRARA-C7) and two appropriate control clones (Vect-C1 andVect-C2) were isolated. A RAR&#945;3 shRNA plasmid construct and the corresponding void vector were stably transfected into ATRA-sensitiveSKBR3 cells. After selection, two cell clones silenced for RAR&#945;3 (RARA-sh18 andRARA-sh19) and two appropriate control clones (Vect-C6 andVect-C8) were isolated. A, D The indicated clones and the parental cell line (WT) were transiently transfected with the RARE-DR5-Lucretinoid reporter construct and the level of luciferase activity was measured 24 h after treatment with vehicle (DMSO) and ATRA (100 nM), as illustrated in the upper bar graph. Each value is the mean &#177; SD of three replicate cultures. The levels of the RAR&#945; protein measured in the indicated clones by Western blot analysis is shown under the bar graph. To demonstrate that similar levels of total proteins were loaded in each lane, the &#946;-actin band signal obtained after re-blotting of the gel is shown. FI = Fluorescence intensity.</text>

      <text>SCID mice were xenografted subcutaneously with 10 &#215; 106HCC-1599 cells on both sides. One week after transplantation 10 animals/experimental group were treated intraperitoneally with vehicle (DMSO) or two doses of ATRA (7.5 and 15.0 mg/kg) once/day, 5 days a week for a total of 24 days. At the end of this period, treatment was discontinued until sacrifice. The size of the tumors was determined with a caliper and the volume plotted.

      <text>RAR&#945; protein and ATRA sensitivity in breast cancer cell lines Total proteins were extracted from logarithmically growing cell lines and subjected to Western blot analysis. The panel illustrates representative Western blots for a number of cell lines. The blots were sequentially developed with RAR&#945;-specific and control tubulin antibodies. The positions of the RAR&#945; and tubulin bands (right) along with the position of a relevant molecular weight marker (left) are indicated. To normalize the Western blot signals in different gels, the same preparation of RAR&#945;-transfected COS-7cell extracts (COS-7) and MCF7 extracts was loaded in each gel. The blots are representative of at least two independent experiments providing similar results.</text>

      <text>Effects of RAR agonists on the growth of Luminal and Basal breast cancer cell lines The indicated Luminal and Basal cell lines were challenged with increasing concentrations of ATRA, the RAR&#945; agonist, AM580, the RAR&#946; agonist, UVI2003, and the RAR&#947; agonist, BMS961, for 6 days. The complement of RAR-variant transcripts expressed in each cell line is shown in the left bar graphs (mean &#177; SD of two replicate measurements). The growth curves (sulforhodamine assay) of the cell lines are illustrated by the right linear plots. The results are expressed in % values relative to the corresponding control dishes treated with vehicle alone (right graphs). Each result is the mean &#177; SD of five replicate wells. ATRA sc = ATRA score.</text>
