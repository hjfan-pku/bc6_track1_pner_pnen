      <text>C. Maximum intensity projection confocal image of a sodium arsenite treated HeLa cell immunostained for endogenous Nup358 (green), P bodies (red, Dcp1a as a marker) and SGs (blue, eIF3&#951; as a marker) using specific antibodies. Scale bar, 10 &#956;m. The histograms represent fluorescence intensity profile along the dotted arrows. Adjacent graph represents quantitative data showing percentage of P bodies (top) or SGs (bottom) associated with nuclear envelope (NE), Nup358 positive AL, with each other or unassociated with any of the other mentioned structures (others). Data are presented as mean SD (n = 3).</text>

      <text>F. Putative SIM-binding regions in AGO2. Three distinct superimpositions of AGO2 (grey) and SUMO (blue), in complex with Nup358-SIM1(red), are shown in cartoon representation rendered with Chimera [90]. The residue numbers on the AGO2 that could be the putative SIM-binding regions are labelled. To identify possible Nup358 binding sites on AGO2, the 3D structure of AGO2 (PDB ID: 4W5O) [89] was compared with that of SUMO (PDB ID: 1Z5S) [47].</text>

Firefly luciferase was used as transfection control. Dual luciferase assay was performed. RL/FL luminescence ration was plotted after normalization with GFP-control. Data are presented as mean SD (n = 3), P&#8208;value was calculated using Student's t&#8208;test.</text>

      <text>C. Ectopic expression of AGO2 restores P body formation, but fails to rescue the impairment in miRNA function in Nup358 depleted cells. HeLa cells were transfected with control (siContriol) or Nup358 (siNup358) specific siRNA, followed by indicated constructs. Left panel: Quantitative representation showing the number of cells showing microscopically distinct P bodies in different indicated conditions. The data was obtained from three independent experiments, and in each experiment, 100 cells were counted from different fields for the presence of intact P bodies and expressed as percentage.</text>
