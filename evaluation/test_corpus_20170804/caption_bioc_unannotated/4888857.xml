      <text>(A) CXCL10 assay characteristics. Standard curves of the short, long and total CXCL10Simoa assays are shown. For each curve, limit of detection (LOD) defined as blank+3SD, are shown as horizontal lines. The LOD was 1.7pg/ml for long and short CXCL10 assays and 0.22pg/ml for total CXCL10. Standard curves were fitted using the 4 Parameter Logistic non-linear regression model. Samples reporting a signal below the LOD were replaced with 1pg/ml for short and long CXCL10.</text>

      <text>Plasma from healthy individuals receiving (B) placebo (n=9) or (C) sitagliptin (n=27) were analyzed by Simoa. Blood samples were collected at screening visit (SV) and day 0 (D0) before treatment, at day 3 (D3), day 14 (W2) and day 28 (W4) under treatment and 5 weeks after treatment interruption (W9). (C) Plasma from chronic HCVpatients receiving sitagliptin (n=3) were collected before (D0) and weekly during sitagliptin treatment (W1 &amp; W3). Antagonist CXCL103-77 (short CXCL10, in blue), agonist CXCL101-77 (long CXCL10, in red) and total CXCL10 (in black) levels are shown. Each dot represents a donor and bars are at the median. Grey areas highlight the period under placebo or sitagliptin treatment. Statistical analysis of (B) and (C) was performed using non parametric Friedman's test, ns: non significant, **: P&lt;0.01, ****: P&lt;0.001. For (C), additional size effect analysis was performed and Cohen's d values are reported. No statistical analysis was performed in (D) due to sample size, nd: non-determined.</text>
