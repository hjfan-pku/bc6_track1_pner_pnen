      <text>(B-F) Suppression of X-ray-induced autophagy in PPM1D&#8722;/&#8722;thymocytes. (B, C) The indicated thymocytes were X-rayirradiated (5 Gy), and 3 hr later, thymocytes were immunostained with an anti-LC3 antibody. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342. Representative images are shown in (B). LC3 puncta can be seen in irradiatedPPM1D+/+thymocytes (arrowheads). In (C), the proportion of cells with LC3 puncta was calculated (n &gt; 100 cells in each experiment). Data are shown as the mean&#8201; &#177; SD (n = 3 experiments). *p &lt; 0.05.</text>

(E) The indicated thymocytes were X-ray irradiated (5 Gy), and 3 hr later, thymocytes were stained with Cyto-IDTM. Representative flow cytometry data are shown. Quantitative data are shown in Fig. EV5C. Cyto-ID fluorescence in irradiated PPM1D+/+thymocytes was higher than that in the other thymocytes.</text>
