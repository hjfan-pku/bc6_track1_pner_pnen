      <text>G-I) Experimental validation of collective survival. All populations grew to high cell densities in the absence of antibiotics (Blue curves). In the presence of antibiotics, only populations with initial densities greater than NCT grew. NCT was increased with the concentration of antibiotics. Engineered bacteria with the QS-BlaM circuit exhibited a significantly higher NCT than those with the BlaM or the QS-CAT circuits. Carbenicillin was used for the BlaM and QS-BlaM circuits; chloramphenicol for the QS-CAT circuit. Each error bar represents the standard deviation from triplicate measurements.</text>

      <text>Configuration of the two-compartment model. The microenvironment of microbial swarmbot is separated from that of the chamber by its permeable hydrogel shell (orange), resulting in two separate compartments, defined as swarmbot and environment (chamber). Four major components involved in the population dynamics are explored in the model, including cell density (n), nutrient (s), carbenicillin (a) and BlaM concentration (b). Each component has a different transport rate, depending on the molecule size. Simulated microbial swarmbot dynamics under a static condition. a = 0.4, a microbial swarmbot with a low n0 cannot initiate growth (red lines) but one with a high n0 leads to growth both in the swarmbot and, after a delay, in the chamber (green lines). While (C) swarmbots with both low and high initial densities lead to eventual full growth in the chamber in the absence of the antibiotic (a = 0). Solid lines: cell density inside swarmbots; dashed lines: cell density in the chambers.  (D) A microfluidic device for controlling and monitoring population dynamics of microbial swarmbot. The device consists of an input channel leading to a culturing chamber and a trapping slot. The chamber is used for culturing engineered bacterial populations both inside and outside the swarmbot, while the trapping slot is for trapping the swarmbot due to its smaller size but allowing the medium to flow through. Input flow patterns (static or pulsing) are controlled by a programmable syringe pump. (E) Experimental validation of model prediction. At 100&#181;g/ml carbenicillin, a microbial swarmbot with a high initial density led to robust growth in the capsule and, after a delay, in the chamber (green lines). While a swarmbot with a low initial cell density did not exhibit growth either in the swarmbot or in the chamber at the same carbenicillin concentration (red lines). (F) In contrast, both the swarmbot and culturing chamber reached high cell densities in absence of carbenicillin, regardless of the initial cell densities.</text>

      <text>(G) Time-lapse images of microbial swarmbot dynamics. The population initiated growth inside the swarmbot and subsequently in the chamber at a high initial density. But no growth occurred for a swarmbot with a low initial density at the same antibiotic concentration (rightmost). The concentration of carbenicillin was 100 &#181;g/ml and the scale bar represents 200 &#181;m. (H) The control strain lacking BlaM circuit. The population could not survive at the same concentration of carbenicillin at the high initial density.</text>

      <text>Time courses of swarmbots treated with varying concentrations of carbenicillin and glucose. Solid lines indicate cell densities inside swarmbots; dotted lines indicate those in the chamber. Safeguard was established for lower nutrient levels (0.004% or 0.04% glucose) along with carbenicillin treatment. At a high nutrient level (0.4% glucose), the safeguard was lost due to either growth in the chamber (panels 3 and 6) or gradual killing of the population inside swarmbot (solid line in panel 9). These results are qualitatively consistent with the model predictions (Fig 4).</text>

      <text>Figure 6. Experimental control of microbial swarmbot safeguard by other circuits. Demonstration of modular safeguard performance of swarmbots with different collective survival systems. For the swarmbots containing cells carrying the QS-CAT circuit, pulsing flow of medium containing 100&#181;g/ml chloramphenicol established safeguard control but not for the static condition. For the swarmbots with the QS-BlaM circuit, the static condition of 100 &#181;g/ml carbenicillin was sufficient for safeguard control. For all the conditions, safeguard did not occur in the absence of antibiotic (top panels from each condition). All the images were from the swarmbots cultured at 37&#730;C for 16 hours. The scale bar is 250 &#181;m.</text>
