      <text>A. Hcp release assay. HA-tagged Hcp (HcpHA) release was assessed by separating cells (C) and cell-free culture supernatant (S) fractions from 109 wild-type (WT), &#916;tssM cells or &#916;tssM cells carrying the AHT-inducible FLAG-tagged tssM-borne plasmid (tssM+) treated (bulgecin) or not (NT) with bulgecin A prior to tssM gene induction. Proteins were separated by 12.5%-acrylamide SDS-PAGE and the periplasmic TolB protein (control for cell lysis), HcpHA and FLTssM were immunodetected using anti-TolB (middle panel), anti-HA (lower panel) and anti-FLAG (upper panel) antibodies. Molecular weight markers (in kDa) are indicated on the left. The experiment was performed in duplicate and a representative result is shown.</text>

      <text>B. Hcp release assay. HA-tagged Hcp (HcpHA) release was assessed by separating cells (C) and cell-free culture supernatant (S) fractions from 109 wild-type (WT) cells before washing cells (before wash) and after washing and growth (after wash) in absence (NT) or presence (bulgecin) of bulgecin A. Proteins were separated by 12.5%-acrylamide SDS-PAGE and the periplasmic TolB protein (control for cell lysis) and HcpHA were immunodetected using anti-TolB (upper panel) and anti-HA (lower panel) antibodies. Molecular weight markers (in kDa) are indicated on the left. The experiment was performed in duplicate and a representative result is shown.</text>

      <text>A. Hcp release assay. FLAG-tagged Hcp (HcpFL) release was assessed by separating cells (C) and cell-free culture supernatant (S) fractions from 109 WT, &#916;mltE cells or &#916;mltE cells producing wild-type (mltE+) or E64Q mutant (mltEE64Q) VSV-G-tagged MltE (MltEV) from arabinose-inducible plasmids. Proteins were separated by 12.5%-acrylamide SDS-PAGE and TolB, HcpFL and MltEV were immunodetected using anti-TolB (upper panel), anti-FLAG (middle panel) and anti-VSV-G (lower panel) antibodies, respectively.

      <text>B. Anti-bacterial activity. E. coli K-12 prey cells (W3110 gfp+, kanR) were mixed with the indicated attacker cells, spotted onto Sci-1 inducing medium (SIM) agar plates and incubated for 4 hours at 37&#176;C. The image of a representative bacterial spot and the average and standard deviation (n=3) of the relative fluorescence of the bacterial mixture (in arbitrary unit, AU) are shown in the upper graph. The number of recovered E. coli prey cells (counted on selective kanamycin medium) is indicated in the lower graph (in log10 of colony-forming unit (cfu)). The black, dark grey and light grey circles indicate values from three independent assays, and the average is indicated by the bar. The experiment was performed in triplicate and a representative result is shown. Asterisks indicate significant differences compared to the wild-type attacker strain (NS, non significant; ***, p &lt; 0.001).</text>

      <text>A-B. Bacterial two-hybrid assay. BTH101 reporter cells producing the indicated proteins or domains fused to the T18 or T25 domain of the Bordetella adenylate cyclase were spotted on X-Gal indicator plates. The blue color of the colony reflects the interaction between the two proteins. TolB and Pal are two proteins known to interact but unrelated to the T6SS or the MltE proteins. The experiment was performed in triplicate and a representative result is shown.</text>

      <text>A. Remazol brilliant blue assay. The absorbance of supernatants from the reaction containing purified and RBB-labelled E. coli peptidoglycan and the indicated protein (50 &#181;g) were measured at =595 nm after incubation for 0.5 or 4 hours at 37&#176;C. The results shown are the average and standard deviation from triplicate reactions (n=3). Asterisks indicate significant differences compared to the buffer (NS, non significant; **, p &lt; 0.01; ***, p &lt; 0.001). The supernatant of the reaction after 4 hours of incubation is shown on bottom.</text>

BS3 cross-linking assay. 2&#215;109 cells of the indicated strain producing FLAG-tagged TssM (with the exception of &#8710;tssM cells) were treated (+) or not (-) with the BS3 cross-linker agent. After the cross-linking reaction, cells were boiled in Laemmli buffer and total proteins were subjected to 7%-acrylamide SDS-PAGE and immunodetected with anti-FLAG antibodies. The TssM protein (FLTssM) and its complexes (*, TssM-TssJ; **, TssM-TssL) are indicated on the right as well as the TssM dimer (arrow). Molecular weight markers (in kDa) are indicated on the left.
