      <text>Associations between CSF T-tau, Ng and NFL (panels A-C). Black squares: CN (n=109), red circles: MCI (n=187), blue triangles: AD (n=93). Associations are shown for Spearman correlations. A&#946;42 and T-tau were measured using the the INNOBIA AlzBio3 kit (Fujirebio, Ghent, Belgium), Ng was measured using an in-house immunoassay for Ng (Portelius et al, 2015) and NFL was measured using the NF-light&#174; ELISA kit (Uman Diagnostics, Ume&#229;, Sweden).</text>

See Table 5 for comparisons between groups. Biomarker levels are standardized to z-scores and shown in boxplots (indicating median and interquartile ranges; whiskers are defined as quartiles 1 and 3 +/- 1.5 * interquartile range, respectively).

      <text>Baseline associations between CSF T-tau, Ng and NFL and other AD traits. Data are estimates (-coefficients) from linear mixed effects models, with 95 % confidence intervals. The estimates are the main effects of the biomarkers, capturing the effects at study baseline. Effects were significant (*) for ADAS-cog: NFL in A-negative (p=.0013) and A-positive (p=.024). Biomarkers and outcomes were standardized to z-scores. Note that the y-axes for ADAS-cog are flipped, so that the lower ranges constantly reflect "worse" outcomes. Note also that the range of the y-axes differs for the different outcomes, for visualization purposes. Models were adjusted for age and sex, and education (for cognitive measures), and intracranial volume (for MRI measures). A&#946;42 and T-tau were measured using the the INNOBIA AlzBio3 kit (Fujirebio, Ghent, Belgium), Ng was measured using an in-house immunoassay for Ng (Portelius et al, 2015) and NFL was measured using the NF-light&#174; ELISA kit (Uman Diagnostics, Ume&#229;, Sweden).</text>
