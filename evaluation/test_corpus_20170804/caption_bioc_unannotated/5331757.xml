      <text>(A) Representative image of a typical young WT cortico-hippocampal slice (350 &#181;m) from co-culture (14 DIV) stained with DAPI (gray) to visualize nuclei (left). Dentate gyrus (DG), cornus ammonis 1 (CA1) and cortical (CTX) regions are indicated. An example of the co-culture dish is shown on the right. Co-culture includes 2 young WT (*, young co-culture) and 2 old APPPS1 (+, old co-culture) brain slices.</text>

      <text>(A) Immunofluorescence analysis of the old APPPS1 slice in co-culture using antibody 6E10 to detect amyloid plaques (green) and Thiazine Red (TR, red) to visualize fibrillar amyloid cores. At 7 DIV, the majority of amyloid plaques contain 6E10 and TR positive dense core surrounded by 6E10 positive halo of diffuse A&#946;. In contrast, at 14 DIV, the majority of amyloid plaques are core-only plaques co-stained with 6E10 and TR without detectable 6E10 positive halo. Lower panels are higher magnification images of boxed regions. Scale bars: 50 &#181;m.</text>

      <text>Either young WT (A, B) or old APPPS1 (C-E) tissue was treated with clodronate (Clo) to remove CD68 positive cells or vehicle Ctr from 1 until 7 DIV. Treatment was stopped and subsequently old (A, B) or young (C-E) tissue was added to the culture as schematically indicated in A and C. and analyzed 14 days after. Removal of CD68 positive cells in either young WT or old APPPS1 tissue prevents amyloid plaque clearance in the co-culture model. (A) Immunofluorescence analysis of the old APPPS1 slice co-cultured with the young WT slice pre-treated with Clo and Ctr and immunostained with CD68 (red) and M3.2 (green). Scale bar: 50 &#181;m. (B) Quantitative analysis of core-only plaques in the old APPPS1 tissue co-cultured with the young WT tissue pre-treated with Clo and Ctr as indicated in A reveals a decreased number of core-only plaques upon Clo treatment. The values are expressed as percentages of core-only plaques from the total number of amyloid plaques and represent mean &#177; SEM from 3 independent experiments, including total of 6 independent slice culture dishes (***P &lt; 0.001). (C) Immunofluorescence analysis of the old APPPS1 slice treated with Clo and Ctr and subsequently co-cultured with the young WT slice and immunostained with CD68 (red) and M3.2 (green). Scale bar: 50 &#181;m. (D) Area of CD68 positive cells (CD68 coverage) in the old APPPS1 tissue treated with Clo and Ctr and subsequently co-cultured with the young WT tissue as indicated in C.

      <text>(A) Old APPPS1 tissue was cultured alone (old alone, white bars) or incubated with conditioned media (CM) collected from young WT slices (old alone + young CM, grey bars). Analysis included co-culture of old APPPS1 and young WT brain slices (old co-culture, black bars) as a positive control and old APPPS1 tissue incubated with conditioned media collected from old APPPS1 slices (old alone + old CM, white squared bars) as a negative control. Quantitative analysis at 7, 11 and 14 DIV reveals increased numbers of core-only plaques upon incubation of the old APPPS1 tissue with conditioned media collected from young WT slices, fully recapitulating core-only plaque numbers observed in the co-culture. The values are expressed as percentages of core-only plaques from the total number of amyloid plaques and represent mean &#177; SEM from 3 independent experiments, each experiment including at least 2 independent slice culture dishes (n.s.= not significant, **P &lt;0.01, ***P &lt; 0.001).</text>

(F) CD68 coverage in the old APPPS1 tissue (14 DIV) cultured alone or in co-culture with young GM-CSF-/- brain slices. CD68 coverage is increased upon co-culturing of old APPPS1 brain slices together with young GM-CSF-/- brain slices. The values are normalized to CD68 coverage of the old slice cultured alone and represent mean &#177; SEM from 3 independent experiments, each experiment including 2 independent slice culture dishes (*P &lt; 0.05).</text>

      <text>(A) Immunofluorescence analysis of the old APPPS1 slice (14 DIV) treated with GM-CSF and vehicle Ctr and immunostained with CD68 (red), cell proliferation marker Ki67 (green) and M3.2 (blue). Scale bar: 50 &#181;m. (B) Quantitative analysis of Ki67 and CD68 double positive microglial cells in the old APPPS1 tissue (14 DIV) treated with GM-CSF and Ctr reveals increased microglial proliferation upon treatment with GM-CSF. The values are expressed as percentages of CD68 and Ki67 double positive microglial cells from the total number of CD68 positive cells and represent mean &#177; SEM from 2 independent experiments, each experiment including 4 independent slice culture dishes (***P &lt; 0.001).</text>

(D) Quantitative analysis of Ki67 and CD68 double positive microglial cells in the old APPPS1 tissue cultured alone or in co-culture with young brain slices (14 DIV) reveals increased microglial proliferation upon co-culturing of old and young brain slices.

      <text>(E) Old APPPS1 tissue was incubated with conditioned media collected from young WT slices and in addition treated with proliferation inhibitor AraC (young CM + AraC) or vehicle Ctr (young CM + Ctr). Immunofluorescence analysis was performed at 14 DIV using CD68 (red) and M3.2 (green). Scale bar: 50 &#181;m. (F) Quantitative analysis of core-only plaques in the old APPPS1 tissue (14 DIV) incubated with conditioned media from young WT slices and in addition treated with AraC or Ctr reveals a decreased number of core-only plaques upon AraC treatment. The values are expressed as percentages of core-only plaques from the total number of amyloid plaques and represent mean &#177; SEM from 3 independent experiments, each including 2 independent slice culture dishes (***P &lt; 0.001).</text>
