      <text>Human red blood cells (RBCs) were incubated with 400 nM pigment or control &#916;cylE extract, and kinetics of K+ and Hb release was monitored. Data shown are the average and SEM of six independent experiments. The time to 50% K+ and 50% Hb release with pigment was 4.8 min and 8.4 min, respectively; n = 6, P &lt; 0.0001, extra sum-of-squares F test.</text>

      <text>Role of osmoprotectants in pigment-treated RBC. HumanRBCs were pre-incubated with GBSpigment for 2 min at RT, centrifuged, and resuspended in the presence and absence of 30 mM osmoprotectant with hydrodynamic radius of 0.40 nm (PEG200), 0.56 nm (PEG400), 0.89 nm (PEG1000), 1.1 nm (PEG1500), or 1.6 nm (PEG3000), respectively. Release of Hb was measured after 1 h of incubation at 37&#176;C. Data shown are the average and SEM of three independent experiments.</text>

      <text>Characteristics of membrane permeabilization by the GBSpigment in artificial lipid bilayers. Lipid bilayers were generated using diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine (DPhPC) and treated with either 2 &#956;M pigment or an equivalent amount of the control &#916;cylE extract. In the pigment-treated sample, channel conductance indicating disruption of the membrane is seen within 45 s. Erratic and non-discrete fluctuations in current are observed, suggesting the formation of multiple, small membrane defects. The bilayer eventually breaks at 120 s. In lipid bilayers treated with the control &#916;cylE extract, the mean ionic current trace remains constant at 0 pA, showing no membrane disruption. Data shown are representative of three independent experiments.</text>

      <text>C, D The shRNA THP-1macrophages were incubated with various concentrations of GBSpigment or &#916;cylE extract for 4 h. Cytotoxicity was measured by alamar blue assay (C), and IL1&#946; release in supernatants was measured by Luminex assay (D). Pigment-mediated cytotoxicity is dependent on the NLRP3 inflammasome components, suggesting that pigment is inducing a programmed cell death. Data shown are the average of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate.

      <text>C, D Intracellular potassium concentration was measured by ICP-AES. THP-1macrophages transfected with the scrambled control (C) or shNLRP3 (D) were treated with GBSpigment (1 &#956;M) or an equivalent amount of the &#916;cylE extract. At various time points, cells were lysed and intracellular [K+] was measured relative to untreated cells (see bars and left y-axis), and percent cell death was quantified by alamar blue (see squares, dotted connecting lines and right y-axis). Both NLRP3-proficient and NLRP3-deficient macrophages initially lose intracellular K+ due to GBSpigment (compare t = 0 min to t = 30 min), but the NLRP3-deficient cells (shNLRP3) are able to recover, while the scrambled control do not, demonstrating that initial K+ loss occurs independently of NLRP3. Data are average of three independent experiments performed with independent pigment preparations in triplicate and were analyzed using Dunnett's multiple comparison test following ANOVA; all data were compared to control at t = 0, error bars &#177; SEM. (C) n = 3, ***P = 0.0002, *P = 0.019, **P = 0.0032 for 120 min, **P = 0.0072 for 180 min. (D) n = 3, **P = 0.0043, *P = 0.031.</text>

Pigment treatment of the scrambled shRNA control cell line induces more caspase 1 activation compared to the shNLRP3cell line, demonstrating that the pigment activates caspase 1 exclusively through the NLRP3 inflammasome.

YVAD is able to significantly decrease cytotoxicity in cells treated with GBSpigment, demonstrating that caspase 1 is required for GBSpigment-mediated cell death, characteristic of pyroptosis, while DEVD had no effect.
