      <text>Comparison of constitutively active rhodopsin mutants M257Y6.40 (left [21]), T94I2.61 (middle) and G90D2.57 (right [16]). All-trans (yellow) and cis retinal isomers (orange), the side of retinal attachment K2967.43 (blue slate), the retinal counterion E1133.28 (blue slate), G&#945;CT peptides (cyan) and the constitutively activating mutations M257Y6.40, T94I2.61, and G90D2.57 (green) are shown as spheres. Palmitoylation at C323H8 and glycosylation at N15NT are shown as sticks. The lower panels compare the M257Y6.40, T94I2.61 and G90D2.57 retinal-binding pockets. All constructs also contain an additional thermostabilizing disulfide bridge, depicted as (c-c), to enhance the stability [18] and crystallizability [19] without changing the rhodopsin activation pathway [20].</text>

      <text>Accelerated molecular dynamic simulation of the rhodopsin dark state: WT, G90D2.57, T94I2.61 and T94I2.61 with protonated E1133.28. In the absence of the G90D2.57 and T94I2.61 dark state structure, both aspartate and isoleucine were placed in the WT (1GZM [48]) using a favorable rotamer without introducing major clashes with the rest of the protein. However, both isoleucine and aspartate in the dark state structures introduced clashes with several amino acids and were therefore optimized using energy minimization before simulation. WT simulation was done with the protonated SB while in the G90D2.57 system, both E1133.28 and SB were protonated [36]. The protonated state of E1133.28 was unknown in T94I2.61, therefore simulation were done for both deprotonated and protonated E1133.28. The T94I2.61 dark state conformation with deprotonated E1133.28 was similar to that of the WT and was stable, whereas the dark state of G90D2.57 and T94I2.61 with protonated E1133.28 was unstable with a concomitant movement of E1133.28 residue away from the SB, thereby, causing movement of TM3 and opening of the E1133.28-SB activation switch. In contrast to the crystal structures the orientation of the retinal -ionone ring in the simulations was variable with respect to the polyene chain. This indicates a degree of positional freedom within the hydrophobic binding pocket.</text>
