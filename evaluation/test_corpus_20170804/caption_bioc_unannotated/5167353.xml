      <text>a) Photomicrographs represent 2D optical sections from a Z stack acquisition of whole mounted skin displaying IFE harbouring multiple clones of different colours at 3, 5, 12 and 24 weeks (bar represents 50 &#956;m). In each image a clone is circled in white, illustrating the progression of clone size at different times. b) Histogram charts showing the relative frequency of clones according to their size between 3 and 24 weeks in mice induced at P21 and P42. The frequency of larger clones increases over time. Chi square test p&lt;0.0001 for P21 group and p=0.0056 for P42 group. The number of clones evaluated at each time point is indicated above each histogram series. c) and d) Correction for contiguous clones harbouring a same colour.</text>

      <text>d) Plots show the probability for an individual keratinocyte to belong to a clone of a given size. Experimental data are represented in green bars. Red curve represents the 5-colour simulation and the blue curve the real size simulation. Although the frequency of large clones is overestimated in experimental data due to the limited 5-color palette, it is apparent that real clone size progresses over time.</text>

      <text>b) Photomicrographs represent 2D optical sections from a Z stack acquisition of a whole mounted back skin harbouring multiple clones of different colours at 12 weeks. The yellow and blue clone in the IFE immediately adjacent to a HF are considered as attached to the HF. The orange and pink clones are not attached to the HF. Limits of clones (lines) and cells (dots) within each clone were identified on this optical section. White dashed circles represent the projection of hair follicle openings (scale bar= 50 &#181;m).</text>

      <text>d) Plot showing the probability of a clone to be attached to a hair follicle as a function of its size (dashed line: predicted curve based on theoretical probabilities according to spacing of hair follicles at different time-points; squares: experimental data). Between different time points the distance between hair follicles varies slightly; therefore each time point (3, 5, 12 and 24 weeks) has a distinct theoretical curve. The observed frequency of clone attachment to hair follicles is at every time point above the random prediction.</text>

      <text>a) Anagen and telogen skin identified by skin pigmentation at the time of collection were obtained from each Skinbowmouse at different time points. Histogram charts represent the relative frequency of clone size from clones attached (top row) or not (bottom row) to HF in anagen and telogen phase at the time of tissue collection. Clones connected to hair follicles were more likely to be larger in anagen compared to telogen (Chi square test, *** p=0.0009 at 3 weeks, *** p&lt;0.0001 at 5 weeks, * p=0.0193 at 12 weeks, *** p=0.0001 at 24 weeks). However no difference between the two phases was observed in clones that were not attached to HFs. Clone numbers are indicated on the graph. All data are represented as mean &#177; s.e.m.</text>

      <text>c) Skinbow mice were induced at a time were the back skin contained both areas of anagen and telogen and samples collected for evaluation at 7 days. Histogram charts represent the relative frequency of clone size from clones attached (top row) or not (bottom row) to HF in anagen and telogen phase at induction. Even at a rate of one cell division per 24h, 7 cycles of divisions results in 128 cells. Therefore the findings reported are not incompatible with our claims as suggested. Observation of spontaneous recombinations if they exist are therefore a very rare event that we have never been able to observe. Such rare event is unlikely to influence our analysis based on sizes of hundreds of clones. Chi square test, *** p=0.001; ** p=0.01.</text>
